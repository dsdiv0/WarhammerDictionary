Title	Description
Imperium	The Imperium of Man, also occasionally called the Imperium of Mankind and simply the Imperium, is the galactic empire under which the majority of humanity is united. The founder and nominal ruler of the Imperium is the god-like Emperor of Mankind, the most powerful human psyker ever known.[3a] The Imperium is the largest and most powerful political entity in the galaxy. An Imperial planet might be separated from its closest neighbour by hundreds or thousands of light years. As a stellar empire, the size of the Imperium cannot be measured in terms of contiguous territory, but only in the number of planetary systems in its control.[3a] While it is commonly stated that the Imperium is an empire of a million worlds[3a][10a], the Imperium controls countless worlds[10f]. Some state between a million,[10a] millions,[10b] a billion or even billions in total.[10d] The overall number of planets has never been exactly determined, entire departments of the Administratum are devoted to cataloguing every controlled world, a task without end, due to the constantly changing nature of the domain. New planets are constantly discovered, conquered or colonised while old ones are lost[10f]. The Imperium also controls untold millions of stars.[10e] The Imperium rules a million worlds is a common saying heard across its citizenry. A million worlds sounds numerous and strong. A dominating force. Easily understood by the egos of men. In truth, the Imperium is spread out thinly across billions of worlds, individual motes scattered across the vastness of the galaxy. Vulnerable to its many perilous threats.
Adeptus Mechanicus	The Adeptus Mechanicus, refered to in shorthand as AdMech,[48b] formerly known as the Martian Mechanicum, is a technological organisation, often known as the Priesthood of Mars. It holds a monopoly on technological knowledge in the Imperium. Their Forge Worlds turn out the Imperium's most powerful and advanced weaponry and equipment. The organisation's adepts, the Tech-priests, are vital in maintaining much of the Imperium's more technologically advanced equipment, not least of which is the Emperor's life-sustaining Golden Throne.[48a] While the Adeptus Mechanicus is a part of the Imperium, it has developed separately and enjoys a considerable degree of independence. Due to the great amount of power it wields, the Adeptus Mechanicus could almost be said to be like an allied empire, rather than an organisation within the Imperium. The Adeptus Mechanicus also follows a different religion from the rest of the Imperium. The religion and religious structure of the Adeptus Mechanicus is known as the Cult Mechanicus. The symbol of the Adeptus Mechanicus is a skull, half-bone and half-machine, set against the background of a black and white cog. Adepts of the Adeptus Mechanicus are known as tech-priests. Any member of the Cult Mechanicus over the rank of menial will often be referred to as a tech-priest, though Magi and higher ranks are usually referred to by rank. As befits the religious nature of the Mechanicus, tech-priests usually wear robes, which are usually either rust-red or white. Tech-priests are often cybernetically augmented. The level of a techpriest's augmentation is highly dependent on his rank within the Cult Mechanicus; a novice may have only one or two augmented systems, if any, while very senior members may have only a few biological organs left in their bodies.
Ratling	Ratlings (Homo Sapiens Minimus), known also as Runtlings, Stunties and Maggots but among themselves as Halflings, are small and hedonistically jovial abhumans who commonly work aboard spacecraft as cabin crew and runarounds, benefitting from their low stature. They rarely find employment in the Imperial Guard due to their physical weakness and less than ideal temperament, but their expertise in marksmanship, low weight, and short height (which lends them a stealthy quality) make ratlings well suited to the role of sniper. Ratlings are the smallest type of abhuman, their ancestors having become stunted by thousands of years of inbreeding on worlds with naturally soporific climates and abundant harvests. Ratlings rarely reach 1.3 meters in height, being even smaller and slighter than Squats, and though their lack of dietary restrictions tend to make them husky, they are not particularly strong or resilient. They are idle, hedonistic, loud, gregarious, over-friendly and sexually promiscuous. Their lives are spent eating until sick, drinking copious amounts of intoxicating liquids, and procreating uncontrollably. Their proclivities towards food exemplifies in their cuisine, which is well known as phenomenal among the Imperial Guard.
Joygirl	A Joygirl is a term in Imperial Culture for a woman who sells her body for money; a prostitute. Joygirls are often employed in Joy Houses.
Cyber-mastiff	Cyber-Mastiffs are Mastiffs, or other Canids, that have received varying amounts of bionic upgrades. Some are almost entirely mechanical creatures resembling a hound and guided by the brain and nervous system of a hunting creature, after such components have been integrated by members of the Adeptus Mechanicus. It isn't uncommon, however, to see mostly biological canines who have only received a minimal amount of cybernetic upgrades. Commonly known as kill-dogs, razorfangs and rending rovers, Cyber-Mastiffs have an in-built hunting and attack instinct and can only respond to the simplest of commands from their assigned handler, but are still fully capable of defending themselves and their masters. They can be fitted with additional sensors, such as an Auspex, which are always used on passive. It is said that Cyber-Mastiff can rip off an Ogryn's arm in just one snap of its powerful jaws. Some cyber-mastiffs are vat-grown; furred-slabs bulked out with vat-grown muscles and ridged with augmetic implants. Cyber-Mastiffs are often deployed under the control of Adeptus Arbites Patrol and Enforcer units for hunting down their prey and to catch criminal fugitives who attempt to escape. Some cyber-mastiffs will pin a target with their teeth barely penetrating their throat, pinning them to the ground with their bulk, waiting for their handler's kill-command to be given.[25h] Cyber-Mastiffs are a fearsome extension of the Emperor's Law, and a truly terrible sight to see unleashed.
List of Terms	This page is intended to define terms commonly used in Warhammer 40,000. See also: Imperial Terms See also: Tau Lexicon
Astra Militarum	The Astra Militarum, commonly known in Low Gothic as Imperial Guard, is the primary fighting force of the Imperium of Man, so numerous in size that even the Departmento Munitorum cannot place a figure on the number of Guardsmen under arms at any one time; the lists of new recruits and toll of casualties can run into the millions in a single day. Every single year, trillions of new recruits are tithed into the Guard, giving their commanders a functional infinite source of manpower, with it being said that, if the entirety of the Imperial Guard would form up in a column, it would reach from Terra to Armageddon. It would be unfeasible trying to put any exact number on the strength of the Guard; however, it is believed that there must be many billions of Guardsmen, divided into millions of regiments. This absolute numeracy provides the Guard with its main power; their ability to deploy in numbers that, eventually, result in victory. Attacking in seemingly endless influxes across battle-zones, charging forth under the cover of massive barrages and delivering massed lasgun volleys, in the Guard the individual Human soldier may appear a lost thing, almost forgotten. Yet the actions of these anonymous soldiers daily decide the fate of worlds. In times of crisis the Imperial Guard will call upon their deadliest of soldiers, whether they are the Imperium's famed Storm Troopers or the regimental elite Kasrkin and Death Korps Grenadiers. The Guard forms the very backbone of the Imperium; without it, Mankind would surely perish. Whilst regular Guardsmen are hardly the equals of Space Marines, fighting neither with the advantages of genetic enhancement or the most powerful personal weaponry, the Guard possesses the courage and the manpower to face and annihilate the enemies of the Emperor across the galaxy.[2a]
Mortuarium	A mortuarium medical facility where corpses are stored and autopsies conducted. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here. A mortuarium is similar to a coroner's and medical examiner's facility.
Vincent Morrow	Sergeant-Major Vincent Morrow is a respected leader amongst Inquisitor Grendyl's warband and a former member of the Armageddon Steel Legion.[2b] As a Trooper, Vin Morrow joined the 2nd Company of an Armageddon Steel Legion regiment under the command of Captain Belis Vanderack. He was promoted to Sergeant by Captain Vanderack after the death of Sergeant Havergil in battle. Their regiment was among those that fought in the First War for Armageddon. Early in the conflict, Morrow led a recon platoon that killed Haranak the Red, one of the Hounds of Angron. Later on, under orders from Commissar Kurt Namark, the company was tasked with disrupting the supply lines of Heretic Astartes assaulting the River Styx. This was an apparent suicide mission.
Micro-Bead	Micro-beads, comm-beads or vox-beads are short-range communication devices used by the Imperium. Micro-beads are worn in the user's ear and, if produced to a high craftsmanship, are nearly undetectable by casual inspection. Their range can be good out to about one, five, or ten kilometres, but such things as bad weather, dense terrain and intervening rock or plasteel can greatly reduce this range. Micro-bead signals can be picked up and boosted through the use of vox-casters. Micro-beads are designed to fit into standard issue Guard rebreathers and helmets. They are directly attached to the throat, enabling sub-vocal communications, both transmitted and received. This way, the wearer retains 360° natural hearing capabilities. Outgoing sub-vocal transmissions are picked up from vibrations of the larynx while incoming sub-vocal transmission are transmitted directly to the ear canal through the facial bones.
Synth	Synth, or also known as Synthetic, is a general Imperial term for any food or material that is synthetically created by the Imperium. It has been noted that Synth fabric has a shininess to it, that real fabric lacks.[2a]
Manhunter	Bounty Hunters, also called Manhunters, are Imperial or Xenos citizens who are licensed by their worlds to capture or kill fugitives, criminals and creatures for a bounty.[1b] Some Imperial worlds are known to even allow mutants, abhumans and xenos to serve as bounty hunters as well.[3a] On the hive world Necromunda in the Segmentum Solar, bounty hunters are amongst the toughest and most dangerous of all Underhivers and are drawn from a wide range of backgrounds. They tend to be loners who neither need nor want to be associated with a gang, though some are erstwhile gangers and might still bear some of the distinctive trappings of their former Clan House. Many Abhumans on Necronmunda also find the life of a bounty hunter suits them well, for the Blood Warrant that serves as their license and writ allows them to go where others of their kind might ordinarily be barred. Thus, it is not uncommon to see Beastmen, Squats and other stable Abhuman strains operating as bounty hunters far from those areas on Necronmunda that are set aside for their kind.[1b] The Merchants Guild also has their own private order of bounty hunters, known as Adurators, who are granted special privileges and are equipped with the best weaponry and equipment the Guild has to offer. While they normally work on Guild bounties, it is not unusual for an Adurator to also collect bounties in the Underhive, where they can more easily throw their Guild authority around.[1c] The majority of official bounties on Necronmunda are displayed at Trading Posts in the Underhive, and offer rewards to anyone who brings in outlaw leaders, gangs, mutants and other criminal types. The rewards offered are good, but the job is a perilous one and many bounty hunters die out in the wastes, slain by the outlaws and mutants they set out to hunt.[1b]
Magna-rail	Magna-rails are a type of Rail Weapon used by the Leagues of Votann, which fire lethal projectiles at incredible speeds through the application of linear accelerators. Their high velocity rounds are capable of puncturing heavy armor, force fields, psychic barriers, and heavy chitin alike.
Plasteel	Plasteel is a type of versatile metal alloy, an advanced material used by the Imperium in the construction of many forms of armour, both personal and vehicular, and in the construction of buildings. Among the strongest and most expensive, this highly durable and very lightweight material can be formed into a variety of shapes and textures. Plasteel, like Adamantium, Armourplas and Synth-leather, is far more resilient than its archaic counterparts like steel. Antiquated armours made from these archaic materials are unable to resist advanced weaponry and are only used by primitive cultures. Only when fashioned from Plasteel and Armourplas can these archaic armours be effective on the battlefield, sometimes even equalling modern armours in protective qualities. Plasteel is used for all sorts of purposes by the Imperium. For example, heavy-gauge plasteel is used in conjunction with ceramite to form the armour plating of Terminator Armour. Plasteel scattered around Hive Tertium during the Moebian Sixth uprising
Noble	Noble Houses are Imperial families that have been officially recognized as Nobles, by their world's ruling Imperial House, by being given a writ of nobility.[1a] This also includes the Nobles of Knight Houses. The most powerful and influential noble houses in the Moebian Domain are Houses Margrave, Barquette, Consora, and Van Sparzi. On Necromunda, the ruling House Helm'ayr originally ratified the creation of Hive Primus' first Noble Houses in M35 and many of the world's Hives then followed their example[1a]. Since their creation, many new Houses have been created, while others have met their end, by losing their status [1b], or being destroyed [1c]. While they may fight each other, all of Necromunda's Noble and Clan Houses have signed the Oath Nobilies, vowing to never break the world's Pax Imperium with open warfare.[1d]
Rockcrete	Rockcrete is a type of building material used by the Imperium which is cheap and easy to produce. Native stone is ground up and mixed with binding agents to create thick, heavy slabs used in the construction of walls and flooring.
Sanctioned Psyker	Sanctioned Psykers are psykers trained by the Adeptus Astra Telepathica and assigned to serve within the Imperial Guard. They are able to use their psychic abilities to aid the commander in his decisions by predicting or sensing enemy movements, or more directly in combat, psychically attacking the enemy or protecting allies. Commissars are always ready to execute a psyker in danger of Daemonic possession. Throughout the Imperium, psykers are justifiably feared for the danger they present, and held in a regard comparable to that of aliens and mutants. Certain slang has grown up between psykers and non-psykers. Freak, Brain, Witch, Spark Head and Bolt Magnet are all terms for a sanctioned psyker, whereas Blunt is what a non-psyker is to a psyker.[Needs Citation] Fellow psykers will often refer to eachother as Sibling due to the harrowing experiences that is their training on the Black Ships to become sanctioned. Sanctioned Psykers are most often divided into Psyker Battle Squads, consisting of groups of individuals who are barely able to control their awesome power. Ever-vigilant overseer Psykers accompany these more amateurish squad members into battle, helping them attune to each other so that the squad functions as a cohesive psychic unit. Whilst one psyker may start a sentence another shall finish it, several members of the unit chorusing and echoing the words in unison. In battle, they pool their energies to release a psychic blast far greater then the sum of their individual parts. The sonorous chanting of a Psyker battle squad continuously rises as they draw ever deeper into the powers of the Warp, eventually releasing a surge of psychic energy that can create deadly thunderstorms to engulf the psykers foe or send out energy that ruptures organs or rips bodies apart.
Frag grenade	Frag grenades (or fragmentation grenades) are small, anti-personnel grenades, exploding in a hail of thousands of tiny and deadly shards of metal, the effect being to deny an enemy the benefits of any cover as they are assaulted. Frag grenades are very simple in design and effect, consisting of a central explosive core with a fuse inserted and secured by a pin, wrapped in a steel casing. Upon detonation, irregular shards of the casing are propelled at high velocity into the nearby surrounding area. The casing is typically grooved, both to create more shrapnel upon detonation and to provide a secure grip. A single frag grenade weighs about 1 kilogram and has a blast radius between 3 meters and 5 meters .
Vox	This article contains text passages or images with citation issues. The concerned content is marked with "Citation issue" tags. Please help to improve this article by fixing those issues as described in the corresponding Help article. Do also note that it is absolutely forbidden to add new information or content to these marked passages as long as the pre-existing citation issues have not been completely resolved. A Vox-caster, Vox-set,[2b] Comm-link[2a] or Communicator is a sophisticated and reliable piece of Imperial technology used by the Imperial Guard to communicate orders over long distances[2a] via audio or audio-visual pickups. It ties into the strategic command and tactical command net via tight beam transmitters and signal decoders. The appearance and size of a Vox-caster is based on its origin point[2a] and can vary from a separate handheld instrument to a helmet-unit, a wrist strap or a longer-ranged backpack unit. It can also be vehicle-mounted, where it can be upgraded to Improved Comms.. The Vox-caster operates on an oscillating frequency to prevent detection and is heavily shielded to prevent electromagnetic interferences. Even if the transmission is intercepted, a successful deciphering of the message is considered unlikely without dedicated complex deciphering equipment. For this reason, Vox-casters can have closed channels, only receivable by another unit that has the pre-approved deciphering code.
Krak grenade	Krak grenades are anti-tank weapons - the opposite of the anti-personnel frag grenade - designed to "crack" open armoured targets such as vehicles through a concentrated implosive blast. However, the krak grenade must be placed more carefully on the target than frag grenades, because their explosive radius is only half that of a frag grenade. This class of grenade encompass a wide variety of shaped charges, Plasma detonators, and crude bombs, all intended to disable armoured vehicles. Krak grenades are commonly used by the Imperial Guard, Sisters of Battle, loyal Space Marines, and Chaos Space Marines.
Hololith	Hololithic Projectors, or just Holo-Projectors,[2b] are Imperial devices, that display holo images, recordings, or live holo-casts[9a] sometimes called hololiths. Hololithic images are used for a variety of purposes involving 3D displays in communication,[9a] strategic planning, and decoration. Hololith banners[9b] and holo-statues might be used as decoration and display. A cartolith is a hololith map[9c] or 3D display of a map, as used in Space Marine visor displays.[9d] A hololith operates on a blend of material-immaterial technology, allowing for medium range communications on a speed faster than light. Hence, hololiths lack the communications lag inherent to regular, light-speed bound electromagnetic technology. Still, the range of hololithic technology is limited to a solar system, any communications further out need to use astrotelepathy.
Historitor	The Historical Revision Unit is a department of the Administratum, whose main employees are the servants known as Historitors who work within the Imperial Palace. Their job is to revise subversive records of history to a more reverent version. These Imperial scholars who chronicle, catalogue and espouse sanctioned history. The Historical Revision Unit also operates during significant events like the 13th Black Crusade, disseminating news of Imperial battlefield successes to frontline guardsmen alongside the Commission for Moral Truth. Historicus is the title of the unit's head.
Auspex	Scanners (or multi-scanners, or Auspexes) are Imperial short-ranged devices used to detect motion, invisible gases and energy emissions throughout a wide spectrum, such as heat, radiation and most forms of energy given off by vehicles and living troops. Their main tactical use is to reveal otherwise hidden troops and allow them to be fired on. The standard range of a handheld scanner is fifty, five hundred, or fifteen hundred metres, although walls more than fifty centimetres thick as well as certain shielding materials are able to block them. Longer-range, bulky, auspexes have, depending on craftmanship, a range of five or ten kilometres and can penetrate walls up to a metre thick.[6a] Ground vehicle-mounted auspexes can have a range of fifty kilometres.[6b] Aircraft-mounted auspexes can have a range of a hundred kilometres. Auspexes mounted on spaceships can easily scan the orbit and surface of a planet from the edge of a system at the Mandeville point, the collected data visually represented with the help of a hololithic projector[10a] or pict screens,[10b] after being processed by cogitators and mono-task servitors.[10a]
Groundcar	Groundcar is an Imperial term, used typically for any four wheeled vehicles created by the Imperium, for military or civilian usage.[1a] The slang term wheeler usually refers to a groundcar but can refer to any vehicle.
Galaxy	The Milky Way Galaxy is the realm in which Warhammer 40,000 takes place. It is a vast spiral galaxy, ninety-thousand light years across and fifteen-thousand light years thick, containing roughly four hundred billion stars.[12a] Billions of years old, the earliest known sentient race in the galaxy were the Old Ones. Mastering advanced technologies derived from the Warp and creating the Webway, they soon established an empire across the whole galaxy. They believed that all life was useful and they are known to had brought about the rise of numerous new species, such as humanity, as well as impregnated thousands of worlds which they made their own.[7b] The Old Ones soon came into contact with vampire incorporeal beings which fed on the energy of stars known as C'tan. The Old Ones battled the C'tan, forcing them into hiding. At some point, the Old Ones came into conflict with the Necrontyr, a race of highly advanced but short-lived beings. The two civilizations eventually clashed in a massive galaxy-spanning conflict known as the War in Heaven which the Old Ones were winning until the Necrontyr turned to the C'tan in desperation, converting themselves into the mechanical Necrons. This time, the conflict was far different from the previous wars as the Old Ones mastery of the Warp was now countered by the C'tan's supremacy of the material universe. In time, the C'tan began to dominate the galaxy whilst the Old Ones bastions were besieged and their nurtured races being fed upon like cattle by the eternal hunger of the star-gods. Entire worlds were razed, suns extinguished and entire star systems devoured whole by the terrible C'tan. In desperation the Old Ones sired new races to fight the Necrons and C'tan such as the Eldar and Orks.[7b] However this still did not prove enough and slowly the Old Ones were broken, scattered, and finally annihilated by the Necrons and C'tan. In the power vacuum following the war, the lesser creations of the Old Ones such as Mankind were known to had continued to develop but in unforseen ways.[7a] The mantle of galactic dominion would eventually pass to the Eldar who had fought alongside the Old Ones during the war. Exhausted from the War in Heaven, the Necrons departed into the Great Sleep on their Tomb Worlds in order to rebuild their strength and take control of the galaxy once more. Shortly before the Great Sleep the Necron Silent King, Szarekh, engineered a betrayal of the C'tan. The star-gods were shattered and enslaved by the Necrons and Szarekh went into self-imposed exile outside of the Galaxy.
Salvatorium	Salvatorium is the Imperial term for a salvage yard.
Medicae	I pray to slow the blood and staunch the wound. Chiurgeons (also spelled Chirurgeons) are medical and anatomical specialists of the Inquisition, Imperial Guard, Orders Hospitaller, and Officio Medicae. Often serving in the retinues of Inquisitors, these servants specialize not only in the art of healing but also the art of repentance, interrogation, and the yielding of information through torture. Knowing the intricacies of human anatomy, they know the exact amount of punishment they can inflict on their subjects before it expires. They can inflict the maximum amount of pain for the least amount of effort, and then nurse their subject's shattered body back to health in order to begin the process again.
Ogryn	Brute force not work? It because you not use enough of it! Ogryns (Homo sapiens gigantus) are the largest and most physically powerful type of abhuman.[4a] They make ideal warriors and are often recruited into Imperial Guard regiments to be used as close assault shock troops. Ogryns evolved on worlds with harsh and barren environments and high gravity. Most of these worlds, having no other use to humanity, were originally used as prison planets. Ogryns are large and bulky, standing between 2½ and 3 metres tall. The appearance of Ogryns varies according to their world of origin, but all are tough and powerful. Some forms are well-muscled, while others tend more toward grotesque obesity. Stupid and repulsively unhygienic, Ogryns have earned such names as Fats, Flabs, Slobs and Stenches. Ogryn populations produce mutant individuals to the same extent as humans.[4a] There are vat-grown strains of Ogryn;[35c] not an entirely dissimilar process to that of vat-grown base-line humans.[Needs Citation]
Augmetic	Bionics, or also Augmetics, are Imperial mechanical or technological substitutes for biological limbs or organs. Generally the replacement is stronger, more durable, or more effective than the original, or gives its user completely new abilities. The use of bionics is widespread in the Imperium. However, bionics are expensive and mostly limited to valuable servants of the Imperium, such as veteran warriors or skilled adepts, high-ranking Imperial officials and Inquisitors, as well as Planetary Governors who possess the required wealth. An individual may have artificial limbs and organs to replace diseased or damaged parts, or simply to improve their abilities. Bionics include partial and full replacements of body parts, brain implants, cybernetic weaponry and other devices. Although bionic parts are mechanical, many of them do use the user's bloodstream, nerve endings, etc., so damage to one may be as debilitating as an injury to the original part, although in general the bionics are much more durable than their organic counterparts.[Needs Citation]
Fabricator	A fabricator is general term for a craftsperson.
Juvenat	Juvenat[1a], rarely named Juvenatus[1b] or Rejuvenat[1c] - any of a number of anti-ageing treatment used by the Imperium for the extension of human life, maintained primarily through the use of juvenat-drugs but supplemented with augmetic surgery to maintain the youthful look.[1a] Among the wealthy of the Imperial society it extends the lifespan to the point when being just shy of two centuries old is considered an early middle-age, making it hard to distinguish a difference in human appearance in a range between 40 and 400. The treatment is known to be able to replenish the entirety of a damaged body, for example if utterly annihilated in an accident, provided at least the brain stayed intact. Although it is noted that the recovery from such a state takes something between 2 and 3 Terran years (9 Fenrisian months). Among the cheapest and more widely available treatments, there are known practices of: plumping flesh with collagenics; filling creases and wrinkles with dermics, cleaning of eyes and organs, applying a skinweave that pins up the skin folds, resculpting of bones or permanent staining of a skin a tanned colour with nanotic pigments considered in the Imperium as presenting as a mark of health. Multiple treatments on low budget can leave visible deviance from a natural youth, with overly tight flesh and skin too smooth and too monotone.
Thrillboy	A Thrillboy is a term in Imperial Culture for a man who sells his body for money; a prostitute. Thrillboys are often employed in Joy Houses.
Armaweave	High-grade flak-fabric, usually woven into tasteful garments.
Abhuman	Abhumans are human subspecies - descendants of humans who have physically evolved after long periods of isolation on worlds with various extreme environmental conditions.[Needs Citation] The Imperium recognizes 73 stable abhuman strains, of which 46 types are now listed as extinct, with a further 12 suggesting they too have died out or been assimilated into the greater population. The status of the remaining 15 strains is an issue of constant debate within the Administratum's Tithes Chamber Notaries, sub. Planetary Census (Abhumans), the administrative body that deals with Abhuman affairs.[3b] In an Imperium where genetic mutation and spiritual corruption are often interrelated, abhumans are a focus of much controversy. In more liberal times under the Emperor, even markedly divergent abhumans such as the Beastmen could serve in the Imperial Guard and Militarum Auxilla. Since the Emperor's stasis however, only the lesser deviants, such as Ogryns and Ratlings, are considered Imperial citizens. However, they are still distrusted by the more puritan members of the Inquisition.[Needs Citation]
Obscura	Obscura is a widely used, albeit prohibited, narcotic in the Imperium. It produces a pleasant dream-like state which lasts a few hours, but then turns into a deep depression once it wears off unless another dose is taken. It is highly addictive and has been known to be smoked and injected directly into the bloodstream. It is found amongst all classes of civilians and military personal in the Imperium and many smugglers make a good living by importing and selling the illegal substance. It is found amongst the middle- and upper-class citizens of the Imperium, and is used frequently by the followers of Slaanesh in ritualistic activities. Obscura-den's are fairly common in heavily populated areas within Hives, and are notorious for being a frequented area by the less-desirables found in every hive.
Digital weapon	Digital weapons, or digi-weapons, are miniaturised weapons, often concealed in rings or other jewellery. Though miniaturised, they are capable of replicating the punch of full-sized weapons such as laspistols, hellpistols, needle pistols, hand flamers, and Inferno pistols. Though digital weapon can be fired while holding something else in one's hands, the weapon can only be fired once and reloading is extremely difficult. The technology required to manufacture digi-weapons is beyond the capabilities of the Imperium. Digi-weapons can only be created by the Jokaero species. Accordingly, they are very rare and almost impossible to buy. Their possession is normally restricted to the extremely wealthy or influential; they are more commonly used by Inquisitors.

Imperial Terms	A list of commonly used terms in the Imperium. Note that these terms are common but not always universal. Names for similar things can vary depending on their diverse local cultures, whether it be across a hive city district or across the galaxy. companion.
Food and Drink of the Imperium	The Imperium is a massive empire spanning the galaxy and as such its numerous subjects make use of all manner of fauna and flora for foodstuffs. As well as food, Imperial worlds produce a variety of drinks. Within the Imperium, entire worlds are devoted to agriculture and food, providing the necessary sustenance for populations elsewhere in the galaxy. These agri worlds can grow a variety of food in a variety of ways, from the ill-tempered grox that provide meat to simple wheat for bread, with entire continents being given over to the growth of foodstuffs.[Needs Citation] The most standard type of food grown on Agri-Worlds and subsequently distributed to feed the innumerable masses is processed corn. This variety can produce confusion when Imperial cultures mix; in one recorded instance, Tona Criid, a native of Vervunhive on Verghast, mistook camouflage paint for a type of food-paste supplied to the off-world Tanith First regiment.[1b]
Sefoni	Sefoni is a rare and formidable psyker in service to Inquisitor Grendyl. She has served the Inquisitor for a number of years and might know more secrets than even the Inquisitor's most trusted Interrogators. Sefoni is currently assisting the Inquisitor's warband aboard the Mourningstar via clairvoyant scrying of the going-ons within Hive Tertium and training the forces requisitioned by the Inquisition in the Psykhanium.[1b] The Rogue Trader, Shipmistress Brahms has even requested that Sefoni offer her training services in the Psykhanium to her voidsmen crew.[1a] Sefoni is able to speak to individuals directly via telepathy. She is also able to alter the memories and even personalities of individuals, whether willing or not.[1c][1d] The Barber-Chirurgeon of the warband, Oska Krall, even works with her to offer a personality scourge service aboard the Mourningstar, a service that can potentially rewrite an individual's recollection of their entire life's history. Sefoni affectionately refers to Oska as a creative genius and this service they offer as an artistic collaboration.[1d] This procedure requires the use of valuable prismata crystals. Although it isn't explicitly authorised by the Inquisitor, Interrogator Rannick allows it to continue since it might allow for a back door into the minds of their warband's rabble.[1a]
Cogitator	Cogitator is the Imperial term for computers[1a], and they are sometimes referred to as Cogitator Banks or Data-engines.[1b] Produced by the Adeptus Mechanicus, it is said that Cogitators have a highly intelligent Machine Spirit but it does not approach that of true Artificial Intelligence.[1a] They are mostly large and largely mechanical, though can also include organic components. Cogitators are incorporated into buildings or spaceships, but smaller, portable examples do exist. These smaller ones are used by the Inquisition to hold and process information while on the move. Miniaturised Cogitators can even be wrist-mounted. Most Cogitators use datacore technology, having replaced obsolete digital technology after its rediscovery.[1b] The inside of a cogitator incorporates crystalline circuitry. Cogitators can be become glitchy or even possessed by malign spirits if proper rites and rituals are not conducted properly. Emplaced Cogitators process vast quantities of data and can output through Auto Quill printout or Holo-Projection while portable units can interface with Data-slates or similar sources. Data crystals can be inserted into a cogitator's download port to download data to be taken elsewhere.
Dataslate	Data-slates are devices that are commonplace in the Imperium, and serve as the primary means of storing and reading printed text and other media such as video or audio recordings. They are so cheap and easy to make that many contain a single media recording, such as text or an image, and can only play that single file. Others can re-record new information, and transmit and receive data from other devices. Files can be encrypted to prevent unauthorised access. Data-slates can incorporate a hololithic display, allowing for three-dimensional data projection, and a compass capable of recording and storing precise location data.
Glow-Globe	Glow-Globes are Imperial devices used to provide light. They provide light in various colours such as yellow, orange, and red. They can be set behind grilles in ceilings, in chandeliers, or at bedsides, but can also be carried, or hover, and be coded to people's bio-trace to follow their voice commands. Portable glow-globes are rechargeable.
Scholum	Scholum is the Imperial term for a school. Small children in the Imperium are sometimes fortunate enough to go to a scholum in their youth, often finding dull predictability of it boring. This is common for children on Ultramarian worlds.
Augmeticist	"Your body of flesh is utilitarian, crudely functional. But a body like mine, of plastic, wire, and steel, is a wonder of efficiency and grace. It makes me something more than human. I am a work of living art!" - Lady Sephia Trell, Lord Captain of the Axiom Imperial An augmeticist is a provider of cyber-augmetic implants. An augmeticist can also refer to an individual who seeks out mechanical upgrades, not out of devotion to the Omnissiah or necessity like an injured Imperial Guard veteran, but in pursuit of physical perfection and artistic expression. These individuals are often times Nobility who wish to flaunt their wealth and status through various cybernetic upgrades.
Krak missile	The Imperium operates a variety of Missile Launchers and Rocket Launchers. The standard Locke-pattern Imperial missile launcher has a built in targeting device and is fired from the shoulder. It is a single round weapon and cannot be fired on the move. Standard Imperial Guard doctrine is for one man to carry aim and fire the missile launcher, whilst a second man carries the ammunition and re-loads the weapons. A well-drilled fire team can maintain a formidable rate of fire, enough to daunt the bravest of tank commanders. Amongst the Imperial Guard, missile launchers are crew-served weapons, while Space Marines are strong enough to use and reload missile launchers alone. Astartes Missile Launcher (Soundstrike-Pattern)
Enforcer (Security Force)	Enforcers are an Imperial Planetary Governor's heavily armed security forces, which are charged with maintaining law and order on their homeworld. They will rarely act in the pursuit of justice, though, and are far more often an extension of their Governor's will. In order to keep the Imperium's grip on a world secure, Enforcers will discipline, capture and execute those who go against the Governor's proclamations, using a heavy hand to crush any rebellions or seditious elements they learn of. They are distinct and separate from the forces of the Adeptus Arbites, however, who are concerned with any violations of the Lex Imperialis. Enforcers, meanwhile, only have as much authority as they are granted by their Planetary Governor. The Adeptus Mechanicus has its own version of Enforcers, known as the Astynomia.
Narcotic	Narcotics are addictive, albeit illegal, substances used for their pleasurable side-effects, as opposed to combat drugs that are used to strengthen the body and mind for battle (notable on the battlefield, or in gladiatorial arenas). Narcotics can be ingested in a variety of forms. Most notable are being inhaled by smoking or injected directly into the bloodstream. Some narcotics share both methods, or take on other forms of use entirely. Smokable forms are commonly kept in paper cylinders, much like a common cigarette, and are ingested using an igniter and a form of filter. Injected versions are held in injector vials or other forms of containment. Narcotics can take many forms: rocks, glass, plants, gases, liquids, etc.[Help] Since the dawn of time, humanity has used narcotics to alter their psychical, and psychological state. This is true of the 41st Millennium. The most common abused substance during this time are lho-leaf. Easy to obtain, the stick version (which is lit and inhaled via filters) is popular among the Imperium citizenry and military (in the case of the Imperial Guard and the various PDFs). It is a generally understood fact that every hive has a obscura-den located somewhere in it's massive structure, as obscura has become the second most widely abused narcotic in the whole of the Imperium.[Help]
Servo-skull	Servo-skulls are drone-like devices fashioned from human skulls – often those of pious Imperial servants, low-ranking tech-adepts, or loyal adepts of the Adeptus Terra – and then given a rudimentary Machine spirit, support systems, and anti-gravity engine to allow them to hover and drift bodiless through the air. Presumably this chance to continue their work even after death is a great honour in the Imperium. Servo-skulls are most strongly associated with the Adeptus Mechanicus, but are used throughout the organizations of the Imperium to perform specific tasks for which they are installed with the basic equipment required, usually a pair of simple manipulator pincers, a weapon, a Pict Recorder, a projector, surgical implants, stab-light, loudhailer, or various other devices for the many roles that exist. Though they typically take the form of skulls with various mechanical appendages, other designs have also been utilised. The lords of House Draconis for example, utilised set of five servo-skulls crafted to resemble various mythical creatures, the Pegassus, the Chimaer, the Minot, the Wyvornne and the Dracon in reference to heraldic icons of each Knight House of Adrastapol. The roles they fulfil include Librarium functionaries, medical assistants, lumen-bearers, proclaimers or scroll-carriers. Some are designed for military roles, and among these some are built with enhanced optical sensors to allow them to fulfil a scouting role.
The Battle of Tyrok Fields (Short Story)	Every hero has a moment that defines their legend, a battle that sets them on the path they are meant to walk. For Ursarkar Creed, that moment is here. Cadia itself is under threat – the hordes of Chaos emerge once more from the Eye of Terror, and the forces of the Imperium muster to meet them. But on Tyrok Fields, an act of base treachery, spurred on by an old enemy of Creed's, will change everything and provide General Creed a chance to prove his worth once and for all, and embrace his destiny as Lord Castellan of Cadia.
Astronomicon	The Astronomican is a psychic beacon located on Terra, which Navigators use to pilot Imperial spaceships through the otherwise unnavigable chaos of Warpspace. As the beam generated is psychic it exists within the psychic universe of the Warp. It is the duty of the Adeptus Astronomica to maintain all aspects of the Astronomican, including training those who will power it. The Astronomican was originally constructed in M30 in preparation for the Great Crusade. The Emperor brought in large numbers of Tech-Priests and drafted much of Terra's population for the gargantuan task of constructing the Chamber of the Astronomican at the Forbidden Fortress. At the time of its construction, the Astronomican was the single largest structure on Terra, though this would later be surpassed by the Imperial Palace. In the days of the Great Crusade, the Astronomican was powered by the Emperor's own psychic might directly. Without the beacon of the Astronomican to guide their ships through the Warp, Imperial armies would not have been able to enact the Great Crusade. In the climactic Siege of Terra at the end of the Horus Heresy, the Astronomican was initially captured and shut down by traitor forces. However, a contingent of Dark Angels under Corswain managed to recapture the beacon and attempted to reactivate it in order to give Roboute Guilliman's fleet of reinforcements a way to Terra. The Dark Angels proved unsuccessful in reactivating the Astronomican as the Death Guard under Typhus launched a counterattack to retake the Hollow Mountain. The loyalist effort seemed hopeless until Euphrati Keeler led a mass prayer amongst Terran refugees which saw huge swathes of them give their lives in order to restart the beacon and push back the Traitor host.
Transit engine	Trains or locomotives are vehicles used by the Imperium of Man to transport goods[1a][1b] or converted for war. Koloss of Necromunda. An "old train" controlled by the Havoc Engine gang of Necromunda.
Rogue Trader Rulebook	The Rogue Trader Rulebook is the core rulebook for the Rogue Trader Warhammer 40,000 role-playing game. It was developed by Fantasy Flight Games, a gaming company with license to produce Warhammer 40,000 and other Games Workshop products and was published in 2009. The book contains the core rules for the Rogue Trader game as well as extensive background material.
Cameleoline	Cameleoline is a rare artificial substance which can be woven into the structure of most fabrics. Morphic polymer chains in the material automatically take on the colours and textures of their surroundings. The material further incorporates nano-weave circuitry which allows it to absorb and nullify common wavelengths of light. The result is that after a second or two motionless the wearer appears to fade into the background, and effectively cloaks their wearer, offering chameleon-like protection from prying eyes. The material of Cameleoline could be fashioned into cloaks, ponchos, coverings and canopies of all kinds. There is also cameleoline-paint, which is used to cover vehicles, and which acts in the same way as the Cameleoline material.
Clarion	A clarion is a general term for a siren or horn. These are seen across the Imperium and Mechanicus worlds.[Needs Citation] The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.

Servitor	Servitors are mindless drones of flesh and metal used to carry out simple, manual tasks. They are one of the few tolerated forms of robotics in the Imperium as they are simply surgically enhanced cyborgs, not true artificial intelligence. While many are vat-grown clones, often a criminal, particularly one who has offended the Cult Mechanicus, will be sentenced to "Servitude Imperpituis" and will be handed over to the Tech-priests to be mind-wiped, reprogrammed, and cybernetically-enhanced to serve some specific, rudimentary function. Servitors are mindless, possessing only the most basic of instincts. Their brains are programmed to perform only the task they were designed for. In rare cases, physical trauma may cause fragments of the servitors' previous human personality to resurface. The altered and fragmented brain of a Servitor functions poorly unless constantly supervised. Most will go into a state of mindlock, babbling incoherent nonsense as the Servitor tries to assert some form of awareness. Servitors are created by the Biologis of the Adeptus Mechanicus, and supplied to departments of the Adeptus Terra such as the Administratum, and to the Inquisition. Servitors make up the vast bulk of the population of Mars and other Forge Worlds, where they fulfil the role of workers.
Translexer	Translexer are translation devices used by the Imperium. Hive City enforcers might make use of these devices.
Probator	The Probators are the detectives of the Hive World Alecto's Enforcers.[1c] They generally wear lighter armour and weapons than the Sanctioners.[1a] New recruits usually apprentice to existing Probators as junior investigators[1b], while their successful colleagues can achieve the rank of Senioris - with all the power plays that includes. At the Bastions entire floors are dedicated to accommodate their office cells, where they will work through reports and evidence.[1d]
Joy House	Joy houses, also known as pleasure houses[3c] or flesh-houses,[3b] are dens of iniquity where patrons partake of the pleasures of the flesh;[2a] a brothel. Flesh-houses in hive cities are often owned by wealthy Noble Houses, such as those of the Navis Nobilite.[3b] Skin rings are trafficking groups who often prey on poor, young humans and abhumans, selling them into prostitution or forced labour. Joy-houses will buy these individuals from skin runners, keeping said individual locked up until they grow old, at which point they are tossed onto the street.[2b] Flesh-houses can be found in both upper[2d] and lower districts of cities.[2c]
Imperial Guard Terms	This is a list of some of the commonly used slang and terms in the various regiments of the Imperial Guard. Most of the terms are also common throughout the Imperium: This article needs work on its citations.For help on citation see the citation guidelines. You can help Lexicanum by fixing it.
Astynomia	The Astynomia are the planetary Enforcer security force for the Adeptus Mechanicus.[1a][1e] They recruit from members of the Mechanicus who succeed in passing the Astynomia's selection examinations.[1d] They are also found on Imperial worlds that contain Mechanicus enclaves and the Astynomia have jurisdiction over crimes committed there. Should they be required to work with non-Mechanicus organizations, the Astynomia will use a liaison, which could be from the Collegiate Extremis.[1b] The Collegiate Extremis' normal duties, though, can lead to conflict with the Astynomia and there are long-standing suspicions between the two organizations[1c]. However, the Collegiate does recruit members of the Astynomia, who have excelled within its ranks.[1d] Crimes that might elicit the attention of the Astynomia can include murders committed by rogue servitors.[1b]
Plastek	Plastek is a type of plastic-like material used by the Imperium. Plastek is a versatile material that can be fabricated into a multitude of forms. Plastek can be fabricated in the form of a hard rigid material or a flexible one. It can also be fabricated to be transparent or opaque. A great many of mundane objects in the Imperium are made from plasteks.[Needs Citation] Soft, layered clothing can also be made from plastek.[7a]
Ork	Orks are a warlike, crude, and highly aggressive green-skinned Xenos race. Orks are the dominant subspecies of the Orkoids, which includes the smaller Gretchin and Snotlings. Although their society is entirely primitive and brutal, the Orkoid race is also the most successful species in the whole Galaxy, outnumbering possibly every other race. However, due to their aggressive and warlike nature, this massive race is split into hundreds of tiny empires, warring as much between themselves as against other races.[27k] In the purely theoretical event all the Orks were to unite, they would undoubtedly crush all opposition. The Orkoid races are believed to have been genetically engineered millennia ago. Ork legend attributes their creation to the Brain Boyz, a diminutive but extremely intelligent subspecies of Orkoid, who bred the Gretchin to be servants and the Orks to be warriors.[1a] Later evidence establishes that the Ork races may have in fact been created by the Old Ones, who are described as creating the Krork as part of a last-ditch attempt to fight off their enemies such as the Necrons and Enslavers. Krorks were hulking brutes reaching nearly twelve meters tall that wore sophisticated armour great even by the standards of the Imperium during the Horus Heresy. The Orks have had a presence in the Galaxy since that time of War in Heaven, and are known to have first battled mankind long before the foundation of the Imperium, tens of thousands of years ago during the Dark Age of Technology. According to legend, the Orks were one of the very first alien races encountered by humanity - when the first ork and man met on some forgotten airless world long ago, they took one hard look at each other, drew pistols, and shot each other dead simultaneously. Humanity and the Orks have fought innumerable conflicts since then and are unlikely to ever stop. It is said that of all creatures, humans remain the Orks favorite enemy to this day. During the Age of Strife the power of the Ork race seemingly expanded to great lengths. During the Great Crusade, the Emperor led two major campaigns to smash major Ork empire. After defeating the empire of Urlakk Urg at Ullanor, the Ork race was thought to have been relegated to a minor threat by the Imperium. However, Imperial hopes were soon shattered. In 544.M32, an Ork Warlord known simply as The Beast succeeded in uniting much of the Ork race and nearly conquered the entire Galaxy. Leading the largest Waaagh! ever seen, in the end he was stopped in an apocalyptic struggle with the Imperium.[6a]
Laud-hailer	A laud-hailer,[1a] or loud hailer, is a voice amplification device used in the Imperium.[1a] Laud-hailers are often utilised in war as a type of psychological warfare "weapon". Laud-hailers are often used by priests of the Adeptus Ministorum to increase the volume of their booming sermons of the Imperial Cult and God-Emperor. Their battle-gear sometimes incorporates laud-hailers so that their foes can hear the catechisms and curses being screamed at them, even on the noisiest battlefields.[1a] Like other Ministorum forces, Sisters of Battle use laud-hailers to emit proclamations of their righteous fury to strikes fear into the hearts of the enemy.
Grox	The Grox is a large, fast and aggressive reptilian animal originating from the Solomon system. When the system was absorbed into the Imperium, it was discovered the animal possessed many useful traits, such as the ability to survive in almost any environment and to thrive on even the most indigestible food. Grox meat itself is also extremely palatable and nutritious. Because of their value as livestock, they have since been introduced to other worlds throughout the entire galaxy, so that the Grox is now the most common type of livestock animal throughout the Imperium.[1b] They are commonly raised for both food and leather. Grox are animals with an extremely efficient digestive system, able to thrive on common minerals, surviving weeks on a diet of rocks and soil.[1b] They are known to lay eggs.[2a] These reptiles are considered extremely territorial and like their privacy, usually charging any creature on sight, including other Grox. They are large, fast and dangerous beasts, well-muscled with large adults reaching about 5 metres long.[1b] Of note is that they have a soft underside, and it's hard for them to right themselves if upturned, a strategy sometimes employed in hunting them in the wild. Grox are a formidable part of the jungle ecosystems of its homeworld. Primitive human natives consider it a rite of passage for young men to hunt one alone, and then ritualistically eat its heart in front of the tribe. It's from these men that the local tribal populace choose to provide as their imperial tithe of soldiers every Spring.[1a]
Militarum Auxilla	The Militarum Auxilla is a subdivision of the Imperial Guard. This specialist division is comprised entirely of abhuman soldiers. The Auxilla oversees Abhuman specialists in the Guard such as Ogryns and Ratlings. Beastmen are also included in the Militarum Auxilla.
Tech-priest	A Tech-priest is an Adept of the Adeptus Mechanicus. They are the members of the Cult Mechanicus, a priesthood which forms a hierarchy of technicians, scientists, and religious leaders. The Tech-priests provide the rest of the Imperium with its technicians and engineers. Though their bodies often incorporate many mechanical components, Tech-priests are human or abhuman, unlike the slave-machine Servitors which carry out all the heavy and monotonous labour for them. Tech-Priests are Adepts of the Cult Mechanicus. The premiere engineers and technological specialists in the Imperium, they accompany nearly every branch of the Imperium to maintain machinery. Tech-Priests will provide religious rites, anti-corruption wards, and repairs to Machine Spirits to any machine they are qualified to oversee.
Promethium	"Promethium is the heartblood of the Imperium, pulsing through its great engines of war and commerce, expanding Mankind's realm with the regularity of a drum. And when it is spilled, it burns away all the impure with the heat of our hatred." Promethium is a general term for any form of fuel in the Imperium. The term also commonly refers to the substance used as fuel for Imperial flamer weapons, a highly volatile incendiary gel which immediately ignites on contact with oxygen. It reaches super hot temperatures. Similar to napalm, the gel sticks to an individual, continuing to burn on its own accord, even underwater and in space. It also fuels most spacecraft and vehicles, both military and civilian.
Recaf	“Get me a mug of recaff and a lasgun, and I’ll take on a Hive Tyrant!” Recaf, also spelled recaff, is a popular hot beverage in the Imperium made from crushed and brewed leaves. Its composition can vary depending on the planet it is found, but most blends contain some form of stimulant such as caffeine or detoxified pharamoxine compounds. Recaff is considered inferior to real coffee, which is reserved for the highest of Imperial social strata, such as nobles. Men and women of such standing might include high ranking Imperial Navy representatives like Admirals, or other powerful organisational representatives, in a crusade's fleet. Such people never have to drink recaff, which they view as swill.
Lho Stick	A Lho-stick is a popular Imperial narcotic smoked by humans across the galaxy. Much like an M2-era cigarette, a Lho-stick is made of a rolled paper tube containing a scented plant-derived substance, typically lho-leaf. Lho-leaf is a scented, mildly narcotic, and addictive plant-derived substance.[17b] The stick, tube, or cigar is ignited on one end with a lucifer (match), mechanical igniter or any other source of flame. The smoke is then inhaled through the other end of the tube. This end can have a disposable paper filter[3a] and is referred to as the butt or stub. Some lho-stick brands might use different plant-derived substances, such as sludge weed. In some instances, individuals might lace their lho-stick with other substances. For example, fitobarrier enhancers to take the edge off chronic physical pains. Lho-leaf might be stored in a tin, if an individual is inclined to roll the sticks themselves.
Imperial Culture	The culture of the Imperium can be said to be cosmopolitan in that no two worlds are exactly alike. Making all these disparate cultures into one that owes fealty to one source — Terra — is in itself difficult. Some general statements may be made, but the scale and variety of the Imperium defies even these. Unlike currency, there is a unifying language to the Imperium: High Gothic and Low Gothic. High Gothic (and a technical dialect know as "Tech") is the first language on a large minority of worlds, a well-known second language on still more. In the greater Imperium, High Gothic is largely unknown, and is mainly used formally, as in pious benedictions or between adepts, as High Gothic has remained uniform throughout the Imperium.[1b] Throughout much of the Imperium, Low Gothic is the lingua franca, and it has developed a large number of local dialects, lexicons, and accents throughout the Imperium. All variations of Low Gothic have their roots in the proto-Gothic language used during the early Age of Expansion. The Nalsheen and the Sleepwalkers of Gereon use one such Old Gothic-based dialect. Very few feral and feudal worlds have native High Gothic speakers.[1b]
Amasec	Amasec is a popular alcoholic beverage in the Imperium distilled from wine. Its quality can vary considerably, ranging from basic brews to well-aged brands suitable only for fine tastes. It seems to be distilled from grain. An amasec bottle alongside other nondescript containers at a Necromundan bar.
Hive city	A Hive is a huge urban accretion, built-up over many thousands of years, and home to countless numbers of people. Around the entire Imperium over 85% of all planets have at least one hive city cluster. Hives consist of great housing and factory blocks, forming ranges of man-made mountains. These huge towering urban complexes are known as city hives, or simply as hives, and their individual peaks or towers are called city spires or spires. A close group of hives is known as a hive cluster. There are often several thousand hives on a single Hive world. A Hive consists of many layers; the lowest layers form the underhive. Hives are worlds in themselves, where the populace has never seen the outer world, and concepts such as the ground and sky are completely alien. There are entire regions inside the hive blocked off by collapsed sections, where is found the treasure of the hive, the Archeotech hoards, ancient stores of technology.[1a][1b]
Lucifer (Match)	A lucifer is slang for a friction matchstick and called such by some humans in the Imperium. Lho-sticks and cigars ignited and smoked using lucifers. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Detective	Detectives, sometimes referred to as Detective-Arbitrators are specialist Arbitrator officers of the Adeptus Arbites. Wearing red collars to mark them from their peers, Arbites precincts frequently train Detectives in an array of esoteric knowledge. They are tech specialists capable of using computer matrices to apprehend criminals and often work as the eyes and ears of standard Arbites detachments. Often having access to some of the information gathered by local Inquisitors and Astropaths, Detectives are known to no issue employing outright agent-provocateurs to stir up trouble in order to lure out and apprehend criminal elements. Arbites who transfer into Detectives often use their old rank and position as a cover so that they can blend in with Arbites operations and not give away their presence. Beyond their red collars, Detectives have no distinct uniform of their own.
Noosphere	The Noosphere is a type of wireless information technology developed by the Adeptus Mechanicus sometime before the Horus Heresy. To the uninitiated, the noospheric union is a system for facilitating discussion between individuals, a more efficient form of exchange than verbal statements or binharic vox-bursts. While this description is accurate, it is also insufficient. The communion, often used between the upper echelons of the Mechanicus, is a consensual joining of minds. Internal firebreaks and safeguards are normally established to prevent oneself from conveying unconscious thoughts or emotions that can slip past all too easily, particularly in moments of high tension and bleed into the noospheric communion.[2a] Each voice within the noosphere gives it shape and meaning. The noosphere could be described as making up the background noise or hinterlands of a tech-priest consciousness. When conversing, some individuals might interweave their pulses of thought with poignant or sharp-edged snippets or emotion-signifiers to further convey points.[2a] Emotive signifers, such as discomfort or concern, can manifest in the noosphere as bursts code.[2b] Emotions expressed are also heightened and intensified by the nature of noospheric resonance. The firebreaks mentioned prior serve as mental guards and sturdy partitions that maintain one's privacy within the communion, to various degrees, and maintain the proper noospheric environment for the situation at hand.[2d] These mental firebreaks are used often, whether it's a noospheric discussion between close colleagues, a large gathering of hundreds of tech priests being addressed by their fabricator-general, or an active warzone.
Cartograph	Cartograph is the Imperium's term for its maps.[1a][1b]
Chron	Chrons,[3b] also called chronos, are timepiece devices used by the Imperium that are hand-held or worn on the wrist and are generally dependable and simple to use. Any Imperial citizen might find a use for these devices, regardless as to whether they're a middling underhiver[3a] or a Custodian of the Emperor. Although chrons are fairly mundane devices, they're enough of a luxury to be used as collateral for a loan, in some cases.[3a] Some Imperials might subtly flaunt their wealth with a finely crafted timepiece attached to a waistcoat via a golden chain. Intermittently checking their chron to casually flash such a luxury to those around.[3b]
Recidivist	A Recidivist is the general Imperial term for Humans who break the laws of the Imperium or oppose its rule. These include Imperial crime lords, slavers, fencers, fixers and those citizens who commit or preach sedition against the Imperium. The term is also applied to Humans of non-Imperial worlds, who resist the Imperium's efforts to bring Compliance to their Homeworlds.
Ethereal	The Ethereals, or Aun in the T'au Lexicon, are members of the Ethereal Caste, the leaders of Tau society. Not appearing in the earliest Tau mythos, their arrival is credited with starting the unification process between the various Tau tribes and coincided with the implementation of the concept of the Greater Good. They first appeared during a siege between the Tau of the plains (later known as the Fire Caste) and the Tau of the city of Fio'taun (later known as the Earth Caste). The Ethereals brought the two sides together to negotiate and convinced them to follow the Greater Good. Ethereals lead the Tau Empire socially and politically, and sometimes lead the Fire Caste into battle to provide inspirational leadership, so the warriors can achieve more. This is a gamble, however, as if the Ethereal falls in combat the remaining Tau are struck with such grief and anger that battle plans fall apart.
Imperial Cult	The Imperial Cult, also called the Cult Imperialis in High Gothic, is the cult based on the worship of the Emperor of Mankind as Master, Defender, and Father of Mankind, developed following his internment in the Golden Throne. In the 41st millennium the Imperial Cult has almost unrivaled power and influence within the Imperium. Heresy against it is punished severely. The religion is administered by the Ecclesiarchy. The Imperial Cult is the Imperium's state religion, and in many ways the religion is the state itself; it binds humanity together in the service of the Emperor and the Imperium. The principle tenets of the Imperial Creed are the persecution of mutants, the abhorrence of Xenos, and the worship of both the Emperor and Imperial ideals.[1b] The more devout followers of the Creed will undertake The Grand Pilgrimage to Terra at least once in their lives.
Nob	Nobz are among the physically larger and thus more socially powerful members of the Ork race. Nobz are the larger Ork boyz who are still smaller than the Warboss of a tribe, but are able to exert their authority upon their peers through their sheer size and commanding, if brutish, nature. The term "Nob" is believed to be short for a parody of the Gothic word 'Nobles', but pronounced by the guttural Orkish throats as 'Knobs'. They usually get the best pick of the weapons and armour whenever the mob comes across anything worth taking. Nobs are usually found barking orders to mobs of boyz, but its not uncommon to find them in elite squads of their own, or forming the bodyguard for the Warboss, where they will probably in squads of Meganobz.[3a] Banner Nobs are the most respected Nob in a warband, which carries its banner into battle. They are inspiring and fearsome in combat, especially when they learn the banner can be used as a weapon. Standard Nobz wield a variety of deadly wargear in battle, including Sluggas, twin-linked Shootas, Kombi-Weapons, Stikkbombs, Choppas, Big Choppas, Killsaws, Power Klaws, and Power Stabbas.
Chaos	Chaos is a part of the psychic energy that composes Warp space. More generally, "Chaos" refers to anything related to Chaos, including its influence, the Gods of Chaos, their followers, and the Warp. Chaos is almost synonymous with the Warp - the two concepts are inseparable: Chaos is the limitless ocean of spiritual and emotional energy that defines the Warp. It is a great and raw force of change and power, and is both physically and spiritually corrupting. The most gifted mortals, psykers, can utilise this energy, thus making them capable of abilities which transcend the laws of the material universe. However, the malevolent power of Chaos can gradually corrupt a psyker, tainting their mind and body.[Needs Citation] The iconic symbol of Chaos is the eight-pointed star, representing the infinite possibilities of Chaos.[Needs Citation] Chaos itself has many names. The Eldar, for example, call it the Primordial Annihilator while Lorgar and the Word Bearers dub it the Primordial Truth.
Librarian	Librarians are Space Marine psykers. They fulfil several important specialist roles in a Chapter. Off the battlefield they are responsible for interstellar psychic communications. In battle they utilise their abilities as powerful psykers. They are among the most knowledgeable of the Chapter's history and traditions. The earliest known Space Marine battle Psykers were the Host of Pentacles of the First Legion during the Unification Wars. However these warriors suffered from many grim calamities and in time the project was abandoned. Space Marine Battle Psykers reappeared during the Great Crusade. The early history of the Librarians is chequered with mistrust and intrigue. Initially the Legions made no use of psykers within their ranks, however Magnus the Red, Sanguinius, and Jaghatai Khan proposed the Librarian program, allowing the Thousand Sons to train and create Librarius departments in a variety of Legions.[10a] Librarians were favoured for use or have been seen within the White Scars, Night Lords, Ultramarines, Thousand Sons, Word Bearers, Salamanders, Alpha Legion, Dark Angels, World Eaters, and Raven Guard Legions. Some of the Primarchs were against using psykers in the Space Marine Legions at all, or at least within their own Legions. Legions that did not favour their use or employ them were the Iron Warriors, Space Wolves, Imperial Fists, Iron Hands, and Death Guard. The Space Wolves insisted that their Librarian equivalents, known as Rune Priests, were not Psykers in that they drew their powers from the natural energy of Fenris as opposed to the Warp.
Eldar Lexicon	The Eldar Language is highly advanced and almost impossible to understand for lesser races. Many references draw upon the Eldar psyche, mythical figures, and long-lost events. The Eldar also communicate with pose and gesture, it is possible for two Eldar to have full conversations without saying a word to one another. Aeldari Runes are the grapheme of their written language, used in divination or read as a cursive script within the Aeldari written language. Each runic symbol is used for a concept, as opposed to a letter, and many of these word-concepts have different meanings depending on the context in which they are presented. Aeldari runes are used in cartouche heirograms, such as those on the Wraithknight, in two ways: as circles to denote noble houses and ovals to denote Bonesinger schools.
Tau Lexicon	This article collects all known sentences, expressions, terms, and words of the Tau language and their respective translations and meanings. Note: the Tau alphabet doesn't have letters for "Q" or "Z", and uses the same letters for the sounds "C/K" and "I/Y". All Tau names give basic information:
Fire Warrior	Fire Warriors are the backbone of the T'au military force, the Fire Caste.[4c] Having been bred and trained to be soldiers at birth, Tau Fire Warriors strictly follow both the Greater Good and the Code of Fire and represent the best fighters of their species.[4c] They are soldiers outfitted with a wide variety of advanced technology. Their main firearm is the pulse rifle, although they do sometimes use pulse carbines. As basic infantry, they are deployed in smaller numbers than other races' infantry because of the superior firepower they can bring to bear. Fire Warriors are known to be efficient, professional, and cautious fighters. Often deployed from a Devilfish APC, they are able to rapidly deploy and lay down withering barrages of fire against their foes. The basic team is made up of five Fire Warriors, but it is not uncommon for them to contain up to twelve, with or without a Shas'ui team leader present as one of the 5-12, as well as gun drones, marker drones, shield drones, a guardian drone, and/or a turret drone. The Strike Team is the most common type of Tau Fire Warrior deployment. A Fire Warrior Strike Team is a high-speed detachment of shock troops who lay down sheets of withering pulse rifle fire, throwing electromagnetic pulse grenades and aiming powerful tactical support turrets at a rapidly-depleting foe.
Waaagh	The Orkish term Waaagh! refers to four related phenomena. A gathering of Orks generates a psychic field known as the Waaagh! (or Waaagh! Energy), which allows Orks to instinctively recognize who is "bigga" and therefore in charge. Waaagh! energy can also be manipulated by the Weirdboyz in an array of deadly psychic powers.[2a] During the War of the Beast, members of the Adeptus Mechanicus noticed how Ork weapons only seemed to activate when they came into contact with a Greenskin.[1b]

Blanks,[1a] also known as Untouchables, Pariahs[1a], Psychic Nulls[3b] and Blacksouls[4a] are an exceedingly rare strain of Human mutant, whose mutation tied to a so-called pariah gene allows their minds to exude a negative psionic field,[3b] that both disrupts psychic phenomena in a radius and ultimately makes them immune to all tangible and imaginable psionic effect. They possess a negative presence in the Warp, that drains its energies towards their void-like soul.[3a] In scientific terminology of the Imperium a blank is an Omega-Minus psyker,[4b] otherwise called just Omega class negative psionic. As opposed to positive psykers that are found within many species of Xenos in the Galaxy, blanks, and even lesser negative psionics are exclusive to the Human species. The pariah gene is inheritable, and while positive psionic powers have no known correlation with genetics, there exists a direct correlation between a blank parent and a blank offspring.[3b] Some populations are known to harbour a higher frequency of untouchable births, feral folk of the world of Vessor is one of such notable people.[6c] Genetically, a link between negative and positive psykers is not specified. Still, the Assignment of psionic abilities marks blank as a negative psionic, on whom no known extreme of psychic force can have an effect. Defining them by a classification as a psyker of level Omega-Minus[4b], or an 'Untouchable'. The term marks the difference from other classes of negative psionics, which for a lack of a better word are 'touchable' by some psychic powers, extreme or weak, and thus not considered blanks. The pariah gene expresses fully in the Untouchables, while in other, lesser negative psionics, only partially.[3c] Although, there are reasons to suggest that the blanks power is not derived as an expression of a single gene at all. The Emperor of Mankind placed a moratorium on research into the source, after experiments by the Imperial Archotechnologist Corps and the Mechanicum in the early years of the Great Crusade ended in disaster. Furthermore, the origin of the supposed gene is unknown, and the explanatory proposals vary from it being the result of human experimentation during the Dark Age of Technology, xenos tampering, or a natural evolutionary adaptation against the Warp.[7b]
Emperor	"No world shall be beyond my rule; no enemy shall be beyond my wrath." The Emperor of Mankind, also referred to by the Imperial Cult and the Adeptus Ministorum as the God-Emperor of Mankind, is the sovereign ruler of the Imperium of Man, and Father, Guardian, and God of the human race. He has sat immobile within the Golden Throne of Terra for ten thousand years. Although once a living man, his shattered body can no longer support life, and remains intact only by a combination of ancient technology and the sheer force of his will, itself sustained by the soul-sacrifice of countless millions of psykers. His will is omnipotent, extending across the hundreds of billions of worlds that comprise his Imperium. For ten thousand years the Master of Mankind has served Humanity, simultaneously carrying out a multitude of tasks vital to its survival. He simultaneously guides his race through the Emperor's Tarot, soul-binds psykers, holds audiences with his most important servants and directs the Astronomican beacon that guides space vessels through the Warp. His immense psychic powers constantly keep the Chaos Gods in the Warp at bay, preventing their intrusion into the material universe and protecting his people throughout the Galaxy.
List of Lists	The List of Lists, a useful guide to the Warhammer 40,000 Galaxy.
Tau Space Fleet	The Tau Fleet (known as Kor'vattra in the Tau language) is responsible for the defense of the Tau Empire and their stellar expansion plans. Tau vessels are operated by the Air Caste. The Tau also operate a mercantile armada known as the Tau Merchant Fleet. The Tau Empire has only expanded into space during the last millennium. Despite this they have made remarkable progress in developing both civilian and military starships, and have now reached a level where their ships can be compared to Imperial designs. The development of the Tau fleet has been given the highest priority by the Ethereal Caste. By M39 they had spread through the T'au system and ringed their homeworld with orbital research and manufacturing facilities. Further expansion required a drive system capable of spanning interstellar distances, however, and this proved to be a formidable barrier.
Psyker	A psyker is a being who exhibits the ability to use psychic powers. Many races have these individuals, whereas other races are innately non-psychic and never produce psykers, like the C'tan and Necrons, which despise psykers so far as to engineer warriors that actively seek out and destroy them. Some races, like the Eldar, are inherently psychic. Psychic powers are most commonly drawn from the Warp, but Orks draw power from their collective Waaagh!. Psychic powers can take many forms, from predicting enemy movements to projecting bolts of devastating psychic energy. Some can even aid troops towards more devastating attacks.
Warhammer 40,000	Warhammer 40,000 (informally known as Warhammer 40K or just 40K) is a Gothic science fantasy tabletop miniature wargame, produced by British gaming company Games Workshop. Play centers miniature figurines produced by Citadel Miniatures, which represent soldiers, creatures, and vehicles of war. Games Workshop does not officially have a fixed scale for Warhammer 40,000, but by comparing the actual and nominal lengths of vehicle models, we can obtain a rough scale ratio of 1:60. For instance, a Land Raider is supposed to be 10.3m long, and its model in the game is 17cm long — this give us a ratio close to 1:60. Warhammer 40K is the science fiction companion to Warhammer Fantasy. Warhammer 40,000 allows for less regimental, formation-based movement, and deals with more advanced weaponry. The game is currently in its 10th edition.
Ecclesiarchy	The Ecclesiarchy (officially the Adeptus Ministorum) is the hierarchy of the Imperial Cult.[1a] It maintains and spreads the Imperial Creed, the only official religion of the Imperium. Although the interpretation of the Ecclesiarchy's rites and dogma varies throughout the Imperium, any serious deviance from its strictures is considered heresy and dealt with severely. The Ecclesiarchy is based on Terra, its urban palace covering nearly all of the southernmost continent.[1c] The bulk of the Ecclesiarchy consists of the Frateris clergy, the Preachers, Confessors and Cardinals, who see to the spiritual needs of humanity.[1b] Much of the Ecclesiarchy's personnel is recruited from the Schola Progenium, with men entering the clergy and women the Adepta Sororitas.[1b] The Ecclesiarchy is not part of the Adeptus Terra, but a wholly separate organisation. At its head is the Ecclesiarch, who, by tradition, is always one of the High Lords of Terra. Below him are the Cardinals, of whom there are several thousand. Below the Cardinals are the Ministorum Priests: Bishops, Deacons, Abbots, Pontifices, Confessors, Missionaries and Preachers. Many of these posts are aided by a host of subservient functionaries: Logistoras, Quire Masters, Reliquindus, etc.[1b]
Caste System	The T'au caste system is a system of social division that divides all T'au into five distinct groups. Each caste is named after an element of nature, symbolising the purpose and temperament of the caste's members. A T'au's caste is determined at birth and inherited by one's parents. Inter-breeding is forbidden by the Ethereals. For a T'au to choose another caste for himself seems to be impossible, and held contrary to the notions of the Greater Good. The castes are based upon the racial and political divisions that separated the Tau on their homeworld of T'au during the time of the Mont'au. The Castes were first formally established after the Ethereals brokered peace between warring T'au factions at Fio'taun. Emphasizing the need for the Greater Good, the Ethereals decreed that the T'au would be formalized into castes, each known by the element that most befitted its role in the new T'au society.[6a] Overstepping ones lot in their Caste and undertaking actions relegated to another is one of the most grievous crimes in Tau society. For instance, an Earth Caste engineer is usually forbidden from using Fire Caste-issued weapons in a pitched battle without special permission from the Ethereals. Violation of this law commonly results in the accused being sent to a Re-education Facility.
Warp	The Warp is a psychic dimension parallel to real space. It is known by many names: Warpspace, the Immaterium, the Empyrean, the Ether, the Sea of Souls, the Othersea[12a], and also as the Realm of Chaos. Warpspace is a mirror dimension of pure energy. Existing as a mirror to our own reality, the Materium, it is the domain of the Gods of Chaos. These Gods dwell in their own realms, perpetually battling for one another in a struggle known as the Great Game. The size of these realms expands and contracts as the power of the Warp ebbs and flows. The Warp's existence is fueled by the emotions and souls of all sentient beings in the Materium. Warpspace is without form and the laws of time and space do not apply there, for both size and time are simultaneously infinite and irrelevant within The Warp.[3a] Its energies are in constant turmoil, subject to endless disturbances.[3a]
Ork Boyz	Boyz is the Ork term for the numerous rank and file Ork warriors which form the core of any Ork army.[2a] Ork Boyz are about 2 metres (6'6") tall[1a] when standing fully upright and vary greatly in their specific battlefield roles. Ork Boyz who occupy the same field of interest often band together in groups known as Mobs;[2b] frequently these mobs are led by an Ork Nob who epitomises the group's skills.[2a] As basic Ork troops, Ork Boyz vary in weaponry and equipment. They are usually divided into the following categories. Note that Ork Boy can fall into several categories, for example, if he is equipped with Shoota, 'Eavy Armour and Stikkbomms and rides into battle on a Trukk he would be a Shoota Boy, a Stikk Bomma, 'Ard Boy and Trukkboy at the same time.
Mutation	Mutants are creatures bearing some form of severe genetic deviance from the normal members of their species. Some are born mutants, while others have suffered more spontaneous mutation through the influence of the Warp, whether by worshiping it or being exposed to its energies. Persecuted and hunted by Imperial society, Mutants often make up the forces of Chaos.[1b] Mutation among humanity is especially meaningful: as mankind undergoes a long process of evolution into a new, psychic race, the birth of mutant humans accompanies it; and as the metamorphosis slowly approaches its distant conclusion, mutation becomes increasingly common. This constant and random warping of the human gene pool threatens to destroy the human race before it can reach its final form. The only response is to root out those manifesting mutation. There are many Imperial organisations which go about this, some in less sophisticated ways than others.[Needs Citation] Human mutants are often terribly misshapen creatures, abominably deviating from the normal human form. On the other hand, not all mutants are degenerated beasts; many only bear a few extraordinary traits setting them apart from the rest of humanity.
Power Klaw	A Power Klaw is an extremely powerful Ork power weapon. It is similar in characteristics to an Imperial power fist, being an armoured, powered gauntlet, strapped to an Ork's arm with a piston-driven pincer comprising two to three snapping blades. These are sheathed in energy the same way a power fist is, and so can effortlessly rip through any armour, tearing any enemy into bloody paste. It is particularly effective against vehicles. These weapons are amongst the biggest and choppiest an Ork can possess and often serve as symbol of status as well as a weapon. As such, many of them are owned by Warbosses or by particularly brutish Nobs; in their hands Power Klaws become even more effective, due to their skill and strength.[3b] Orks often amputate their own arms, taking the weapon as an augmetic implant. Power Klaws are most often found incorporated into Mega Armour.[Needs Citation] Power Klaw
Whiteshield	"Children you call them? They can pull a trigger just as well as veterans, and they have the spirit of a bull narthax. Call them children if you wish - I call them troops. Good troops."- Colonel Marus Cullen of the Pannonia 5th Infantry Regiment Whiteshields are young reinforcements to an existing Imperial Guard Regiment. They fight in actual combat as part of their later training until they have proven themselves ready to join the regiment as full Guardsmen. Officially designated as probitors, they are more commonly called whiteshields, as well as cadets, probationers or gun babies. Whiteshields are the sons fathered by Guardsmen during their posting and raised within the regiment. As they are not yet considered true Guardsmen, Whiteshields do not wear unit insignia - the only markings they are allowed to wear are blank white badges as well the white helmet stripe that distinguish them. Severe disciplinary action may be given to those who decorate their uniform with badges or slogans, being seen as impudent presumption by those who have actually earned the right to be proper warriors.
Flamer	Flamers (or flame-guns) are a basic type of flame weapon used by several races and armies. Flamers unleash a liquid incendiary superheated chemical, usually promethium, that bursts into flame as it leaves the weapon. They are valued for their ability to destroy many enemies at once, regardless of any protective cover. Both flamers and the more compact hand flamers are considered assault weapons due to their relatively short range. Imperial and Chaos Space Marine flamers fire a mix of highly volatile liquid chemicals which are ignited by a pilot light at the weapon's muzzle.[Needs Citation] The flaming chemical sticks to its target and continues burning of its own accord - those who are not killed instantly die horribly as the super-hot chemical continues to burn. Flamers are an invaluable tactical choice in conditions where spotting the enemy is difficult due to dense terrain (such as jungles), during urban fights and bunker assaults. Flamers are particularly effective in breaking the cycle of Ork infestation by destroying the spores exuded by the corpses.[Needs Citation]
Conscript	Conscript platoons are the most basic infantry unit available to Imperial Guard Regiments, having very little training and using only the most basic equipment.[1a] Conscripts represent hastily conscripted men, raised from surrounding planets in dire situations. In times of great emergency, the Departmento Munitorum will demand local Governors raise vast quantities of troops for immediate action. Such measures can see entire cities or continents all but emptied and its citizens sent off to fight. Whiteshield cadets and otherwise ill-trained troops, often too young or old for normal conscription, are inducted into the Imperial Guard and rushed through basic training. They form squads massed together as a single platoon. The concentrated firepower of a large platoon tends to outweigh the relative lack of combat ability of the individual conscripts.[1a]
Sandy Mitchell	Sandy Mitchell is a pseudonym for British writer Alex Stewart, who has authored several books for the Black Library. Mitchell/Stewart has been a full-time writer since the mid-1980s and was first published by the Black Library in 2002. He has also written fiction for Warhammer Fantasy and background material for the Warhammer roleplaying game, including Scourge the Heretic, the first tie-in book to the Dark Heresy roleplaying game. He lives in the Cambridge. His hobbies include the martial arts of Aikido and Iaido.
Valhallan Ice Warriors	The Valhallan Ice Warriors are the Imperial Guard Regiments from the Ice world of Valhalla. Valhallan soldiers are famous for their tenaciousness in holding their ground against even the most hopeless odds, and their ability to suffer the most appalling casualties without breaking.[1a] Like many of the Guard's most iconic regiments, the Valhallans are shaped by their unique homeworld and the history of their founding. Several millennia before M41, Valhalla was a verdant paradise, but a comet impact knocked the world out of orbit and radically altered its climate, transforming the planet into a frozen ball of ice, where virtually no plant or animal life can survive aboveground without protection. The small percentage of the planet's population were forced underground, into the caverns which offered the only protection from the surface cold, with little access to food or supplies. Ultimately, the Valhallans only survived by carving cities deep beneath the ice and heating themselves with their world's thermal energy. As if to add insult to injury, the cataclysm was followed swiftly by an Ork invasion. Yet as poorly-prepared as they were, the Valhallans refused to surrender their homeworld. The grim campaign that followed pushed the Orks off-planet, and taught the Valhallans a means of surviving in their world's new climate.
Savlar Chem-Dogs	The Savlar Chem-Dogs are a Penal Legion of the Imperial Guard, composed of some of the most hardened criminals and desperadoes in the Imperium. Recruits are drawn from the prisons on the planet Savlar by the promise to allow them to keep anything they take from the battlefield, as well as the chance to get away from Savlar's highly toxic environment. The Chem-Dogs were conscripted into the Imperial Guard en masse in order to meet the Imperium's desperate need for troops during the Third War for Armageddon. Originally founded by Judge Callistar to put down an armed uprising on their homeworld, he realised the Chem-Dogs could be made into an effective fighting force with the right motivation. Therefore the Chem-Dogs were given the following directives: they could keep any war loot they took off the enemy, but if they broke the law they would be sent back to Savlar. Savlar Chem-Dogs excel in fighting in the cramped, noxious battlefields found in Armageddon's Underhives. They are also notorious thieves, scavengers, anarchists and worst, stopping to strip the dead of their valuables in the midst of battle, while many inhale a type of altered gas which puts them into a hyper-aggressive state. For this reason, Chem-Dog regiments include Commissars to watch over them.
Lictor	Lictors are Tyranid creatures that act as specialist scouts and vanguards, roving ahead of the Tyranid swarm to seek out and locate potential prey.[1a] Lictors are masters of stealth and can move swiftly through even the densest terrain without any sound. They are covered in a Chameleonic Skin that changes colour to blend in perfectly with their background and renders them all but invisible to the naked eye. They are not instinctively aggressive, like other Tyranid creatures, but are opportunistic hunters that will stalk their prey from the shadows, avoiding situations where they would be outmatched, until they choose to strike. They will often pick off their prey in ones and twos while they are separated from reinforcements. Lictors have in fact been known to wait motionless for days, completely unnoticed by their victims, until the right time to strike.[1a] Lictors are armed with mantis-like claws, Scything Talons, Flesh Hooks, and Feeder Tendrils which are tipped with sharpened bony plates strong enough to pierce a victim's skull and are used to lobotomise victims and devour their brain. From a victim's brain, Lictors can absorb their memories, and so learn the position of enemy forces or any weaknesses that the Tyranids could exploit.[1a]
Carapace armour	Carapace Armour refers to a type of heavy body armour used by many agencies of the Imperium of Man, from the Imperial Guard and Imperial Navy to the Adeptus Arbites, as well as individuals wealthy enough to afford it like Rogue Traders, and secessionist realms such as the Severan Dominate. Carapace armour consists of large rigid plates of armaplas, ceramite or some other strong material molded to fit parts of the body. While heavy to wear and unable to cover flexible areas such as joints, it offers far better protection over lighter types of armour such as flak armour. This armour is also as much a status symbol as it is a form of protection, with the carapace breastplate worn by many Imperial Guard officers serving the duel purpose of protecting them and displaying their rank. Carapace armour can range from complete armoured suits like those worn by Storm Troopers and the Adeptus Arbites to individual pieces such as chest plates, helmets, etc. Some bodysuits also include simple slots for carapace plates to be inserted, allowing the wearer to customise their level of protection or more easily replace damaged plates. The Cadian-pattern "Kasrkin" carapace suit is the standard body armour of the Cadian Shock Troopers' elite Kasrkin infantry, completely protecting the wearer's body and featuring a suite of advanced technologies. The helmet is equipped with a rebreather, photo-visor, encrypted micro-bead and clip attachment on the side for a light source or vid-recorder, while the suit itself incorporates an integral auspex unit accessed via wrist display and attachments for a grav-chute. Power for these systems is provided for by a small power pack, equivalent in size and cost to a lasgun power pack, which allows for a week of continuous use before requiring replacement. While associated with Cadia, this pattern of carapace suit has been adopted by the Departmento Munitorum for use by other units from as far away as the Calixis Sector.
Ugulhard	Ugulhard was an Ork Warboss of the Snakebites. Allied to the infamous Ghazghkull Thraka, he fought and died during the Second War for Armageddon. Ugulhard was one of Ghazghkull's "best and baddest" bosses by the time of the Second War for Armageddon. When Ghazghkull became frustrated by the Imperial resistance at Hades Hive, led by Commissar Sebastian Yarrick, Ugulhard was selected to deal with the issue. The Snakebites boss consequently led his Boyz into a savage charge, breaking through the Hades Hive's outer defenses and personally killing several Armageddon Steel Legion soldiers. Yarrick stepped forward to stop the warboss. Believing that it would be "too easy" to just shoot the human, Ugulhard discarded his gun and charged at the commissar.
Ursarkar E. Creed	"What do I ask of my officers? Merely that they do their duty with fire in their bellies and a prayer on their lips" Lord Castellan Ursarkar E. Creed was a Lord General of the Astra Militarum and the leader of the Imperial forces of Cadia during the 13th Black Crusade. He was the most renowned of all Cadian Shock Troopers and led Imperial forces through the most important battles that the Cadians have ever faced, from raids by the Eldar to the periodic Black Crusades led by the forces of Chaos. Jarran Kell, Creed's loyal Colour Sergeant, was always found by his side and has fought through countless battles with him.
Verghast	Verghast is a Hive World located in the Sabbat Worlds.[1a] Roughly ninety years before the Siege of Vervunhive, two of the major hive cities of Verghast, Vervunhive and Ferrozoica, fought against each other in a conflict known as the Trade War. Vervunhive emerged victorious in the war, earning much glory.[1b] After the Imperial victory at Balhaut, the Chaos warlord Asphodel escaped the Imperial forces and eventually arrived on Verghast, where he corrupted the hive city of Ferrozoica and attacked the neighbouring hives of Vannick and Vervunhive.[1d] Vannick was destroyed by atomic weapons, while Vervunhive was subjected to a protracted siege.[1c] A relief force from the Imperial Guard joined Vervunhive's defenders and managed to barely repel the Chaos attack, though the city itself was destroyed.[1g] Asphodel was killed in a commando raid led by Colonel-Commissar Ibram Gaunt.[1f]
Warboss	The Warboss is the highest position in a large Ork Waaagh!; he is always the biggest, strongest and most cunning Ork in any given grouping of such creatures, and gets the best armour, weapons, and equipment.[2b] He is easily distinguishable from his brethren because of his bossy nature and tendency to be over nine feet (3 metres) tall. As a general rule of thumb, the more successful a Warboss is, the larger he is.[2b] In battle a Warboss often directly leads his tribe, and is a force to be reckoned with himself. Warbosses commonly keep a group of Nob bodyguards, Gretchin ammo haulers, and a pet Attack Squig around, making them even more formidable in combat.[Needs Citation]
Screamer-Killer	Screamer-Killers are a variant strain of Tyranid Carnifex. An older adaptation of the basic Carnifex strain, Screamer-Killers are named for the terrifying ululating shriek that accompanies their deadly bio-plasma discharges. They're able to tear apart hapless enemies with huge sweeps of their scythe-shaped talons, and immolate any survivors with incandescent bolts of their bio-plasma. Screamer-Killers are said to be the largest and most infamous variant of Carnifex. 1st Edition Screamer-Killer
Long-las	The Long-Las is a sniper variation of the lasgun with a much longer barrel for increased range and accuracy, and also to prevent overheating. However the barrel makes a Long-Las up to twice as long as a standard lasgun and thus difficult to use in close quarters. An extremely skilled sniper like Larkin is capable of using the Long-Las to make a kill-shot at a distance of 4000 metres. Within the Imperial Guard the Long-Las, formally known as the Sniper Variant Lasgun (or Sniper-Variant Lasrifle), is issued only to those Guardsmen with the necessary marksmanship skills and knowledge in stealth and scouting operations. It uses the XC 52/3 strengthened barrel, longer and thinner than normal models, and lacks a charge setting slider, instead using hotshot power packs. It's also much quieter than other lasguns and features a flash suppressor to dampen the revealing flashes of its shots. However, the increased wear on the barrel from using the overpowered energy packs means more frequent barrel changes than is usually required for normal lasguns. A Long-Las can be fitted with an enlarged night-scope array, a bipod stand and a ceramite stock. A highly modifiable Long-Las pattern, popular amongst the gangers and hired guns of Necromunda.

Do also note that it is absolutely forbidden to add new information or content to these marked passages as long as the pre-existing citation issues have not been completely resolved. Tempestus Scions, also known as Storm Troopers or Stormtroopers in Low Gothic, are the elite shock troops of the Militarum Tempestus. They are trained to carry out special operations such as deep strike assaults, reconnaissance and infiltration beyond enemy lines. Storm Troopers are the very best soldiers the Guard can call upon, being trained to the peak of human perfection, their combat skills are unmatched by any normal guardsman. Either as part of an Imperial Guard regiment or as the Militarum Tempestus Scions are used to enact missions that the regular Guardsmen cannot handle and often form an elite core entrusted with carrying out important missions such as spearheading assaults into heavily fortified positions and infiltrating enemy lines. Scions undergo a brutal training regime and are armed with the very best weaponry available to the Guard. Their violent potential is enhanced by rigid discipline as a result of Ordo Tempestus training and they will carry out any order regardless of how inhumane it may be. Fully prepared to give their own lives for the Imperium, Scions are indoctrinated with a sense of obedience and duty that overrides any instinct of self preservation.[1a]
Flak Armour	Flak armour is among the most basic forms of armour in common use by the Imperium. It is a relatively primitive form of armour, used most commonly by Imperial forces. Flak armour consists of multiple layers of different ablative and impact absorbent materials designed primarily to deflect or absorb the majority of the force from a shot or blow. It is meant to provide defence against low-velocity, dispersed damage, such as explosions, shrapnel and ricochet material, rather than to protect against a direct impact, in which case the armour's protection is poor. The ablative characteristics of the armour provide further defence against heat and energy based damage. Some layers commonly used include Carbon-fibre, Plasfibre and Thermoplas strips, although a number of specialised materials can be integrated in non-standard suits. Most guardsmen wear Flak Armour, a cheaply produced, lightweight armour vest provided en-masse to Imperial Guard units. A flak vest consists of a skeleton of lightweight, flexible metal. This skeleton is then wrapped in multiple layers of a high-tensile fabric that is the main protective component of the armour. After multiple layers of fabric are affixed to the skeleton, the vest is given its toughened outer shell. The same principle is used in the production of Guardsman helmets and bracers. Guards for knees and legs are also produced. Thermal-absorbent materials, applied to reduce the thermal signature of the infantry, help with staying invisible during night recon missions. Rarer still, Cameleoline is incorporated into the outermost layer of some Imperial Guard Regiments' fatigues providing yet more concealment.[Needs Citation] Flak Armour is capable of stopping a large calibre rifle round without any penetration, leaving its wearer only with a hurtful bruise but otherwise unwounded. The wearer can even be unaware of the hit until later, when the combat adrenaline wears off and the bruising sets fully in.
Commissar Yarrick	"Humies is all weak scum dat deserve ta get stomped. 'Cept for One-Eye Yarrick. He knows how ter fight." Sebastian Yarrick (known as The Old Man by the people of Armageddon and as Old Bale Eye by the Orks) is an Imperial Guard Commissar famous for his participation in the Second and Third Wars for Armageddon, in which he twice fought against the Ork forces of Warlord Ghazghkull Mag Uruk Thraka. His leadership and bravery during these conflicts have made him one of the greatest heroes of the Imperium.[1a] Sebastian Yarrick was born Sebastian Vaarden on the world of Taos III. Orphaned at the age of 7, he was raised by his tough but caring grandfather, Yarrick, who himself was a veteran Sergeant of the Imperial Guard. It was from him that he learned the art of survival and combat.
Tanith	Tanith was a Forest World of the Imperium[1d] located in the Sabbat Worlds cluster of Segmentum Pacificus[3a], which was destroyed by the forces of Chaos.[1d][3a] It is most notable for being the homeworld of the Tanith First and Only regiment of the Astra Militarum.[1a][1d][3a] Prior to the planet's destruction, Tanith had a spotless record for supplying its Imperial Tithe. However, there were rumours that, being so close to the Edge meant that the planet was touched by Chaos.[3a] Research indicates that the initial settlers of Tanith belonged to a human gene-stock branch called the Magmeta, an ethnic strand with multiple genomic markers suggesting it originated from the Terran regions of Albia and Europa.
Gaunt's Ghosts (Novel Series)	The Gaunt's Ghosts (Novel Series) is a Black Library series written or edited by Dan Abnett following the adventures of the Tanith First and Only Imperial Guard Regiment battling to free the Sabbat Worlds system from the forces of Chaos. The series is one the most successful lines of the Black Library, consisting of 15 Novels, two short story anthologies (Sabbat Worlds and Sabbat Crusade), two spin-off novels (Double Eagle and Titanicus) and two background books as of the end of 2014. The fifteenth and most recent novel, The Anarch, was published in January 2019. First and Only (1999) Ghostmaker (2000)
Dan Abnett	Dan Abnett lives and works in Maidstone, Kent, England. He graduated from Oxford University and he has worked as a comic book and children's book editor. He now concentrates full time on writing. In the years since then, he has written for a diverse range of characters - including Scooby Doo, Thunderbirds, Conan the Barbarian, the X-Men, Johnny Bravo, Batman, Rupert the Bear, Dr Who, Mr Men, The Terminator, and Postman Pat.[Needs Citation] Abnett's early work for the Black Library includes the Gaunt's Ghosts and Inquisitor Eisenhorn novels. His later work includes several volumes of the ongoing Horus Heresy Series (including the first, Horus Rising (Novel)), and the screenplay for Ultramarines - A Warhammer 40,000 Movie.[Needs Citation] He has also co-authored several works for the Warhammer Fantasy universe, including the novels Gilead's Curse (with his wife, Nik Vincent) and Hammers of Ulric (with James Wallis).[Needs Citation]
Shotgun	My trusty old shotgun. Primitive in some people's eyes, but reliable. Colonel 'Iron Hand' Straken A shotgun is a projectile weapon, which uses the energy of a fixed shell to fire a number of small spherical pellets called shot, or a solid projectile called a slug. The shotgun fires a large, solid slug or a dispersed fragment shot. Some shotguns are drum-fed, others are pump-action, while the most primitive are single shot weapons. They are strongly made, simple weapons that have only a short range but are quite effective against unarmoured targets. Their versatility and ease of construction compared to weapons such as lasguns, makes them widely used. Even the lowest-tech factories can produce these weapons, making them a common sight in the galaxy. Favoured for urban and shipboard combat, where their short-range stopping power comes into play, shotguns have found their way into the arsenal of many Imperial organisations. One of the non-common shell type - the gas shells - release a deadly gas that can kill target and quickly disperse after that.[1c]
Tyranid	The Tyranids, also known as The Great Devourer are an extragalactic alien race, whose sole purpose is the consumption of all forms of genetic and biological material in order to evolve and reproduce. Tyranid technology is based entirely on biological engineering. Every function is carried out by living, engineered creatures, each of which collectively forms the Hive Fleet, directed by a single Hive Mind. The Tyranids are seen as one of the gravest threats to the entire Galaxy. They seek only to consume all organic life and cannot be reasoned with or deterred in this quest. Worse still for the Galaxy, thus far the Tyranid Hive Fleets that have been encountered are merely the furthest stretched tendril of the main invasion fleet that is still traveling in the void of space.[10b] The exact origin of the Tyranids themselves is unclear, save the fact that they are not of this galaxy and have only recently arrived here after traveling countless millennia in the intergalactic void. It is unknown which galaxy they originated from, or for how long the Tyranid race has been on its genocidal rampage, but it is believed that it is the Astronomican that is drawing the Tyranid Hive Fleet to threaten the Galaxy.[1j] The Tyranids were first attracted to the Milky Way Galaxy when the Xenos communication device known as the Pharos was overloaded in the Battle of Sotha during the Horus Heresy. Indeed their very name is but a title given to them by the Imperium, named after the planet where they were first encountered (Tyran). It is possible that they have been preying on other galaxies since time immemorial.[1b] According to another source, they have consumed one thousand galaxies and are responsible for the annihilation of millions of intelligent species.
Fury Interceptor	The Fury Interceptor is the most common starfighter used by the Imperial Navy for space combat, having replaced the older Wrath Starfighter by the end of the Horus Heresy. With some variants reaching 60 to 70 metres in length, the Fury is significantly larger than most atmospheric fighters, and carries a pilot, navigator and gunner, although a pilot and gunnery officer are more than sufficient on scouting missions. On occasion, an Astropath will also be aboard to provide greater communications capability. The crew of a Fury Interceptor often wear suspensor wire pressure suits and specially contoured helmets to prevent to side-effects of rapid-acceleration. The Fury's reinforced hull contains an extensive network of circuitry and life-support systems, including pumps that cycle super-oxygenated blood into the crew's bodies through spinal connections, a chemical toilet, and sleeping compartments. Furies are normally equipped with multiple forward-firing banks of lascannons and anti-starfighter missiles, and its twin engines are able to put out sixty thousand pounds of thrust.[3d] The pilot can lock-on onto enemy crafts through his weapons sights.
Machine Spirit	A machine spirit is what the Imperium refers to as the inner workings and automated systems within their technology. These are distinct from forbidden Abominable Intelligence, as they lack the ability to enhance themselves. The maintenance and functioning of Machine Spirits in all Imperial technology is overseen by the Tech-Priests of the Adeptus Mechanicus. The advanced system consists of a combination of organic and mechanical components within the vehicle and in essence act as automated systems. Not all vehicles are equipped with such systems, but vehicles that are can operate entirely on their own without a crew, with some success. The Adeptus Mechanicus believes that Machine Spirits can be influenced by religious rituals and are near-bestial in nature, capable of exhibiting emotions such as hatred and stubbornness. In particular, the machine spirits of Titans and Knights are revered for their intensity and require elaborate awakening and taming rituals. With devices such as the Throne Mechanicum, pilots of these engines can link with a Machine Spirit directly. The addition of a machine spirit is advantageous in the case of the vehicle's crew being killed or incapacitated, as the auto-systems are able to take control of the vehicle, firing its weapons and driving (providing the systems themselves are still functional). However, the machine spirit normally cannot fully replace the abilities of trained human pilots (going that far might trespass on the Imperium's condemnation of Abominable Intelligences, and could garner the attention of the Inquisition).[Needs Citation]
Commissar	Commissars are special Imperial officers assigned to Imperial Guard regiments and Imperial Navy ships, whose purpose is to enforce discipline and devotion to the Emperor of Mankind. Independent of the conventional Imperial Guard Hierarchy, Commissars are instead attached to the Departmento Munitorum's Commissariat and are formally part of the Militarum Tempestus. Commissars are invariably stern and uncompromising individuals, able to keep even the most anarchic regiments in line through fear, strength and power. Every regiment has one or more attached Commissars who remain with the regiment throughout its duties. Commissars are assigned to regiments by the Departmento Munitorum's Commissariat department, which provides high-ranking commanders to Imperial Guard armies. They have authority over both the soldiers and regimental officers. Commissars have both the right and duty to immediately execute any Imperial guardsman or officer who shows cowardice or incompetence in battle. They must also ensure the regiment does not harbor the likes of Genestealer Cultists, Chaos heretics, spies, or mutants.[1a] Personnel selected to become cadet Commissars are drawn from the Schola Progenium - Ecclesiarchy-run schools where the pupils have already received a strict Imperial Cult education. The training of Cadet Commissars lasts for an indeterminate length of time, and their advancement depends entirely upon the judgment of the full/senior Commissar responsible for their development. Training may involve deployment as part of a Commissar Training Squad and/or secondment to an individual full/senior Commissar.[Needs Citation]
Drop-Trooper	A regiment is the primary organisational unit of the Imperial Guard, and of the Imperial Army ground forces before that. The size and composition of Imperial Guard regiments is not standardised across the Imperium; the number of individual Guardsmen alone can vary enormously between regiments, with some only a few hundred strong at founding-strength, whilst others possess tens of thousands of fighting troops. The formal term for a collection of Regiments drawn from a single world (e.g. the Cadian Shock Troopers) is Militarum Regimentum, while a specific Regiment from that force (e.g. the Cadian 8th) is referred to as a single Regiment. However, in practice, even amongst the agents of the Departmento Munitorum, the two terms are used interchangeably. Every Imperial world has to provide one-tenth of its Planetary Defense Force for recruitment into the Imperial Guard. This happens in regular intervals and when required by circumstances. These recruits have to be of the highest quality and are usually recruited from the best PDF units. Regardless of their origin and after becoming a part of the Imperial Guard, these forces are all equally divided into regiments, consisting of several thousands soldiers.
Imperial Armour Volume One - Imperial Guard and Imperial Navy	Imperial Armour Volume One - Imperial Guard and Imperial Navy is part one of The Imperial Armour serie and has 288 pages. This volume focuses on the Imperial Guard, the Imperial Navy, and Imperial Tanks.
Meltagun	Melta Guns are the basic version of Melta weapons, used by forces of Imperial origin, including the Imperial Guard, Space Marines, Ordo Hereticus, and Adepta Sororitas. Given their fairly quiet and very effective nature, infiltrating parties make use of meltaguns to destroy enemy vehicles before they get a chance to fight on the battlefield.[1a] They are also given names such as 'fusion guns', 'melters', and 'cookers'.[Needs Citation] Meltaguns are effective anti-armour weapons used by various Imperial forces for close range assault and anti-tank roles. They are most effective at close range, capable of reducing nearly any material to molten slag through super-heated blasts. Besides its role as a weapon, a meltagun can also be used as a battlefield engineering tool. It can put a hole a metre in diameter into a disused extraction pipe to create an entrance[19b] or reduce a dozen cubic metres of ice to steam in a single firing in a cramped underground tunnel to provide expanded elbow room.[19a] Accataran Pattern MkVIII Meltagun
Cadia	This is Cadia, you silly fool! Cadia! Right on the doorway of Chaos! Right in the heart of everything! The seepage of evil is so great, I have a hundred active cults to subdue every month! This place breeds recidivists like a pond breeds scum. This is Cadia! This is the Gate of the Eye! This is where the bloody work of the Inquisition is done!" Cadia was a terrestrial Fortress World on the edge of the nebula known as the Eye of Terror. The planet was situated in an area of space known as the Cadian Gate, the only stable, permanent route into and out of the Eye of Terror large enough to allow the passage of battlefleets. For this reason, Cadia was heavily fortified against the assaults of Chaos and was a frequent target of Abaddon the Despoiler's Black Crusades. Prior to its destruction, the planet's surface played host to a variety of terrain types, from frozen tundras and wind-swept moorlands to axeltree forests.
Chaos Space Marines	The Chaos Space Marines (also known as Traitor Marines, Chaos Marines, Heretic Astartes or Traitor Legionnaires) are counted among the most favoured and powerful servants of the Powers of Chaos. Ten thousand years ago, Horus, Warmaster of the Imperium and most trusted 'son' of the Emperor, fell to Chaos due to a conspiracy by the Word Bearers. Besides the Space Marine Legion under his direct command, the Sons of Horus, eight of his brother-Primarchs and their legions also joined him in the Horus Heresy against the Emperor. Only when Horus was slain at the ultimate conflict of the Heresy, the Battle of Terra, was the rebellion broken and the defeated Traitor Legions hounded into the Eye of Terror, which remains both their prison and sanctuary to this day. The Chaos Space Marines have not forgotten their defeat in the Heresy, and for the last ten thousand years have waged the Long War against the Imperium.
Catachan Jungle Fighter	"We've run into scorpions the size of battle tanks. Three men died from Eyerot last week and I've sweated enough to fill a lake. Emperor help me, I love this place, it's just like home!"- Captain Rock of the Catachan III "Green Devils", commenting on Varestus Prime. The Catachan Jungle Fighters sometimes referred to as "Baby Ogryns" due to their thick slabs of muscle, are the fearsome Imperial Guard Regiments from Catachan, the most notorious Death World in the Imperium. Because of this, Catachans have a well-deserved reputation as the deadliest jungle-warfare experts in the galaxy.[1f] Extremely resourceful and uncompromising warriors, they are skilled up close with their specialised and brutal close combat blades or from ambush with their lasguns. In jungle terrain they are unsurpassed, with each Catachan being worth ten of any other regiment, and those skills learnt in the jungle are easily adapted to other war zones. Due to generations of being bred on the galaxy's most lethal planet, Catachans are known for being both taller and more powerful than any normal human. Their ranks include some of the deadliest men in the Imperium, including the legendary "One Man Army" Sly Marbo and the "Stonetooth Devil" Harker, a man whose endurance and strength is such that he shrugs off even the most grievous of wounds.[1f]
Carnifex	Carnifexes are hulking, powerful Tyranid creatures used as living battering rams. They are often armed with the most powerful Tyranid Bio-weapons, and are used in shock assaults, spaceship boarding actions, massed battles, and for battering through fortified positions and tank formations.[1b][14b] Carnifexes excel at thunderous charges, where their immense bulk is used to crush or smash through any opponent or obstacle. They are not as swift as other Tyranid creatures but their brute force more than makes up for this. A Carnifex's stampede takes time to build force as their incredible alien musculature strains to propel it forward. As it builds momentum and reaches top speed, the ground shakes with each stride of the monster and foes are scattered or trampled before it, and only fortress walls or Super Heavy Tanks have any chance of surviving the ferocious impact.[1b] Most Carnifex kills registered come from high energy attacks — lascannon, plasma and melta weapon strikes to critical locations. Carnifexes can shrug off other small arms fire and even boltgun hits with minimal loss of function.[4a] Carnifexes are not very intelligent and in fact have little self-awareness. They will revert to unthinking rampages of destruction if not constantly supervised and guided by the Hive Mind.[1b] All Carnifex species seem well able to adapt to extremes of environments, from arctic cold to desert heat.[4a]
Bolt weapons	Electric (Arc • Tesla) • Flame • Gauss • Graviton • Grenade • Ion/Plasma • Laser • Melta • Missile • Bolt • Ordnance • Projectile • Grenade launcher • Monofilament/Web • Sonic • Volkite Chain • Force • Electric (Arc • Taser) • Power • Miscellaneous The bolt weapon is the characteristic Imperial weapon type used most famously by the Space Marines and Adepta Sororitas. They are also used in more limited numbers throughout the Imperium's armed forces, and are popular with its enemies, particularly Orks. Bolt weapons are purposefully unsubtle weapons, with very obvious and bloody effects. The Leagues of Votann also use bolt weapons .
Feral World	A Feral or φλ-class World the classification given to the most primitive human worlds of the Imperium. The populations of feral worlds have long ago regressed to primal savagery, often over very long periods of isolation. The technological level of these worlds remains pre-black powder or even Stone Age. Often the population consists of hunter-gatherer societies using primitive tools and weapons, and in almost all cases human culture is based around the interactions of various tribes, gangs or creeds. The harsh conditions which feral world populations have adapted to makes them ideal recruitment sources for the Imperial Guard and Adeptus Astartes. Occasionally the inhabitants of feral worlds have been pressed into the Imperial Guard when their world lay inside a war zone, and the chosen warriors been given rudimentary training in the operation of laser or stub-weaponry. It is more common, however, for feral world natives to be selected for the various Adeptus Astartes recruitment programs. Feral world Guardsmen are usually tribal warriors tithed to the Imperial Guard by the elders of their particular clan. They are sometimes trained en masse in vast drill camps or ship holds, whilst others are merely shown a lasgun and trusted to get on with it. Also, there are those instructed by members of their tribe, using rote-learned rites and religious rituals.
Imperial Navy	And of all your works, greatest are these vessels, for they carry the blessed into righteous battle The Imperial Navy, or Navis Imperialis in High Gothic, is one of the armed forces employed by the Imperium. While the Astra Militarum (or Imperial Guard) is responsible for the Imperium's ground forces, the Imperial Navy is responsible for the fleets of warships that soar between the stars and planets in the Imperium as well as engaging threats both inside and outside the Imperium's borders. The Imperial Navy is the military arm of the Imperial Fleet and was, until its separation after the Horus Heresy, a branch of the Imperial Army. During the early Imperium in the Great Crusade-era, the Imperial Navy was originally a subbranch of the Imperial Army known as the Imperialis Armada. During this time, the Imperialis Armada was primarily used for the defense of Imperial space while planetary invasion was left to the fleets of the Legiones Astartes. However, after the devastating Horus Heresy, which saw widespread rebellion from within the Army, Lord Commander of the Imperium Roboute Guilliman felt it prudent to separate the Army and Navy in order to lessen the threat of future insurrections.
Lasgun	The Lasgun is an energy based weapon, and is the most common and widely used type of laser weapon in the Imperium. It is standard issue for all Imperial Guard infantry and most lower-ranked officers. The lasgun is the ubiquitous weapon of the Imperial Guard and is seen by its soldiery as more than just a simple firearm. It is an instrument of Mankind's divinity and the destroyer of the foes of humanity. Despite countless patterns of lasguns existing, there is are base specifications that are followed across the entire breadth of the galaxy and the weapon is widely available on most Imperial worlds. It is known as reliable, easy to produce, light, simple to maintain, and with decent range and stopping power. The weapon has been in service for over 10,000 years, little changed since then. Able to operate in nearly every environment, the weapon's distinctive cracking sound when it fires is known across the battlefields of the galaxy. The standard template of lasgun operates on a nineteen megathule range and can utilize any Departmento Munitorum power pack, regardless of pattern. Lasguns have longer range and higher ammunition capacity than a laspistol (the laspistol power packs have roughly 80 shots before depletion, compared to roughly 150 shots for a lasgun), but are nowhere near as powerful as a lascannon. They also lack the rapid-fire quality of the multi-laser or the hellgun.
Enginseer	Enginseers are engineer-mystics, members of the Techpriesthood of the mysterious Adeptus Mechanicus and its cult. Unlike most of the Priesthood of the Adeptus Mechanicus, Enginseers can be found serving in almost every Imperial institution (besides the Space Marines), and are often assigned to the Imperial Guard. Enginseers are highly trained members of the Cult Mechanicus and are dedicated to the maintenance of Imperial technology. Through many years of study they have gained the knowledge of the rituals and litanies that form the body of machine lore, as well as a deep understanding of the more practical disciplines of mechanics and electronics. In this role they serve across the galaxy, often in harm's way, as they will be called on to make repairs on the battlefield as well as in the workshop. They are a common sight on battlefields with large numbers of armoured vehicles, and are often accompanied by a retinue of servitors for assistance or protection. Although most Guardsmen revere their vehicles enough not to risk annoying an Enginseer by 'tinkering,' the modification of vehicles to fulfil a certain need is inevitable, much to the chagrin of any Enginseers present. Enginseer contingents are also included in the mighty Titan Legions and the crews of the massive warships of the Imperial Navy, allowing them to perform emergency repairs in the heat of battle.[Needs Citation] Despite the respect they usually command among the units they are seconded to, Enginseers are not held in high regard among the Cult Mechanicus itself as their skills seldom contribute to The Quest for Knowledge. As a result of their overwhelmingly practical knowledge, they are often viewed as lowly but necessary cogs in the workings of the Cult. Enginseers make use of robotic arm augmentations known as Mechadendrites that are connected to their central nervous system via the spine. They are used to help the enginseer in repair operations, heavy lifting and for self defence.[Needs Citation] One of the distinctive tools of their office is the cog-shaped wrench-axe they wield to both repair machines and smite foes.
Grav-chute	A grav-chute is a pack-sized suspensor allowing troops to float safely to the ground from any height. A grav-chute operates via suspensor fields that counteract gravity and two small jets on either side of the shoulders that offer further braking of descent. It is used to drop troops onto a battlefield, either from low-flying aircraft or from the upper atmosphere. If needed, it can sustain hovering the user in place for up to a minute at a time. Essentially a grav-chute is a smaller version of a jump pack, but unlike a jump pack it is only designed to control a fall rather than power a boost up into the air. The power supply lasts for about an hour before needing replacing. Grav-chutes are most notably used by Imperial Guard Storm Troopers and Drop Troop regiments, such as those from Elysia and Harakon.[Needs Citation] In addition to Guardsmen, they can also be used to distribute Drop Sentinels, Support Sentinels and Drop Canisters.
Elysia	Elysia is a world of the Imperium surrounded by wilderness space. The areas surrounding the planet are known for their pirates due to the many barren moons, gas clouds, and asteroid fields that provide perfect cover for the outlaws. The Elysians have been forced to master the art of ship-to-ship boarding actions and fighting in concert with orbital support in the face of the threat of pirates. Elysia is most well known for the regiments it provides for the Imperial Guard, known as the Elysian Drop Troops.
Penal Legion	Penal Legions are Astra Militarum troop formations composed of criminals. The Penal Legions are not armies in their own right, but are attached to other regiments and armies in battle, and are useful where greater numbers are necessary to win the day. Their members are considered expendable, as death is the point of serving in a Penal Legion. They are often used to test enemy defences. New troops have their heads shaved and tattooed with unit insignia, and Explosive Collars are put around their necks. The collars are a disciplinary device rather than a means of turning the troops into human bombs; the blast is directed inwards, killing only the wearer. The collars are controlled by personnel accompanying the force, and are detonated only to restore discipline. As well as the collars, Penal troops are sometimes equipped with frenzon dispensers. Troops sentenced to the Penal Legions serve for life. Most die in their very first battle, herded into the enemy gunfire and dying by the hundreds. A few, the born killers, somehow beat these merciless odds and survive through numerous battles. In extremely rare cases a penitent might be granted the Emperor's forgiveness in a way other than dying in battle, by performing some incredible act of battlefield valour. These redeemed men then enter the Imperial Guard as regular Guardsmen. However the truly irredeemable may be converted into suicide bombers.
Aquila	The Aquila[1a] (plural: Aquilae) (also known as Imperial Aquila , great Aquila and Imperial Eagle) normally[Note 1] refers to a two-headed eagle[1a] that symbolizes the Pax Imperialis, the oath that binds together all Imperial servants under the banner of the Emperor of Mankind. It is a universal symbol within the Imperium and more than anything else represents the dominion of the Emperor. It is also said that the Eagle and its variations symbolize both the Imperium as such and also loyalty to the Emperor as its master. It also is the heraldic device of the Imperial state and at the same time holy symbol of the Imperial Cult. The double-headed eagle also represents the union of the Mechanicum of Mars and the Emperor[12a] or between Mars and Terra. Before the formalisation of the Eagle (also see Raptor Imperialis) as the symbol of the Imperium the Emperor's personal device was the Thunderbolt and lightning emblem which was used during the Unification Wars.[11f] But the Imperial Eagle also is a symbol of the Emperor's War of Unification. Mark 1 Power Armour as used during the wars to unify the Terran system without Aquilae
Rebreather	Re-breathers are devices used by the Imperium that consist of a mask or helmet that contains its own air supply. They make their wearers immune to the effects of gases and are designed to allow their wearer to survive underwater, as well as in the most toxic of atmospheres. Re-breathers typically have air canisters that last for about one hour before they must be replaced. It is possible to smell some chemical weapons through rebreathers, as well as particularly foul and polluted atmospheres, such as on some Hive worlds.[3d] Some zealots and fanatical preachers infuse rebreathers with incense, claiming it expands their mind. However, the result often observed is a manic vigour[3b] aiding them in an indiscriminate slaughter.[3a] While others, from Ministorum Priests to lowly Imperial citizens in book keeping roles or employed in an Ecclesiarchal setting, might see the over-consumption of noxious incense fumes as an occupational hazard and opt to wear a rebreather. However, purists would object against this, commenting on how incense expands the mind[3b] and wearing a rebreather dilutes the quality of one's work.[3c] Rebreathers can be calibrated for various environments and mass-produced.[3f] On the mining world of Adacore, a rebreather was developed specifically to efficiently filter particulates like ore dust. This type of Adacore rebreather is much sought-after in refineries and manufactories across the Imperium.[3e]
Imperial Infantryman's Uplifting Primer	The Imperial Infantryman's Uplifting Primer is a Warhammer 40,000 background book by Matt Ralphs. It takes the form of an in-universe Imperial text that is supposedly possessed by all members of the Imperial Guard as part of their standard-issue equipment. Cover-to-cover, the only thing (apart from its very existence in your hands) marking it out as not an actual Imperial object is the Black Library publishing and copyright information printed on the second page - just underneath the Imperial copyright and publishing information. The Imperial Infantryman's Uplifting Primer is a small book supplied to an Imperial Guardsman on commencement of service. Each Guardsman is required to have it on or close to his person at all times; not being able to produce it on the demand of a senior officer is a disciplinary offence.[1a] It is a compendium of useful/mandatory information for any Guardsman, covering such diverse topics as arms and equipment maintenance, personal hygiene, rules and regulations of the Guard, and enemy recognition and particulars. Additionally, it features a section dedicated to acting as a prayer-book, as well as areas to be filled in by the owner, so that it may act as a record of service. The current, revised edition was published in 945.M41,[1b] although a variant issued to Imperial forces tasked with fighting in the Damocles Gulf also exists.
Catachan	"One of the most dangerous and perilous ordeals known to Mankind." Catachan is the most infamous and lethal Death World in the entire galaxy.[3a] It is located in the Ultima Segmentum and is covered in dense jungle. The planet's entire ecosystem seems consciously hostile to all foreign life. Each and every element of the native flora and fauna of the planet represents a real danger to any human, even Space Marines are said to avoid this hellish place. Catachan has no need for the Planetary Defense Forces utilized by other worlds, its flora and fauna being sufficiently deadly to thwart attackers without the need for human intervention. The planet is known to house the single deadliest creature in the galaxy, with some of its native wildlife even being released on other worlds to dissuade invasion. Catachan's only valuable resource is its people, who by virtue of being born on the harshest world in the Imperium, are invariably tough and cunning. It is the homeworld of the hulking and fearsome Catachan Jungle Fighters of the Imperial Guard. For the death world’s finest, Humanity’s wars present no greater hardship than they face daily, so they proudly answer the Emperor's call to arms.
Adeptus Terra	The Adeptus Terra, also known as the Priesthood of Earth, is the central organisation of the Imperium, to which most of the Imperium's other official departments and organisations belong. Only the Ecclesiarchy, Adeptus Mechanicus, and the Inquisition are not formally a part of the Adeptus Terra, while the Space Marines are only loosely affiliated. The Adeptus Terra is an umbrella organisation, and not really an organisation in itself, as each of its divisions functions largely autonomously. The most powerful individual in the Adeptus Terra (and if not in theory, then in practice, the entire Imperium) is the Master of the Administratum. Membership to any of the various agencies of the Adeptus Terra is coveted by many of the commoners of the Imperium seeking to obtain a better life for both themselves and their families as even low-level membership comes with it exclusive privileges not given to normal Imperial citizens. At the same time the Priesthood is viewed with a large amount of fear and suspicion by the Imperial populace, who pray it will never infringe upon their lives or their worlds. The gaze of the Adeptus Terra often carries with it the chance of being swept up in endless wars or liquidated in pogroms instituted by overly zealous bureaucrats.
Angels of Vengeance	The Angels of Vengeance are a successor Chapter of the Dark Angels created during the Second Founding.[7a] Regarded as some of the most stubborn fighters of the Imperium of Man, these Space Marines have risked the future of their chapter many times by throwing themselves into the most dire situations and refusing to retreat, even when their chances of survival were almost nil. They are even less well known than those of the other Unforgiven Chapters, for they shun fame and celebrations and instead concentrate on their duties and mission. The Angels of Vengeance embody the stubborn devotion of the original Dark Angels Legion above all else, with this trait bordering on single-mindedness. It is also said that the Angels of Vengeance are unrelenting in their persecution of foes to the Imperium, maintaining not only an extreme hatred of Xenos but an even more fanatical disdain for traitors and Chaos Space Marines.[7b] The Chapter's future has been put in jeopardy several times, beginning with their depletion in the Forgotten Wars. More recently, in the aftermath of the Siege of Apolis their losses were so heavy that the Chapter was forced to spend a century rebuilding itself before it could be deployed for battle once more.[4a]

The Citadel Journal 22	Issue 22 of The Citadel Journal was published in 1997. The magazine contains background articles, modelling advice and rules for:
Angels of Redemption	The Angels of Redemption is a Successor Chapter of the Dark Angels, created during the Second Founding. They are almost as famous as their progenitors, but are known to quickly abandon war efforts, at grievous cost to their allies, in favour of hunting the Fallen. As such, most Imperial forces refuse their help, which causes some conflict with Space Marines of other Chapters.[4b] The Angels of Redemption's numerous abandonments of their assigned tasks eventually led to calls for the Chapter to be censured by the Inquisition, but this been forestalled due to the opening of the Great Rift. The giant Warp Storm has prevented reports of the Angels of Redemption's further misdeeds from reaching Terra, which has allowed the most dedicated of the Unforgiven Chapters to continue their secret quest to hunt the Fallen.[9a] The Angels of Redemption differentiate somewhat from their Dark Angels forebears, which replaced the 1st and 2nd Companies with the Deathwing and Ravenwing respectively.[9b] Instead, the Angels of Redemption have dubbed both their first two companies Redwings in emulation.[9b]
Angels of Vigilance	The Angels of Vigilance are Space Marine Chapter suspected to be of the Second Founding, although they are not listed in the Apocrypha of Davio, and of unknown gene-seed origin. They are known to have a strong monastic nature and unflinching devotion to duty. This demeanour, combined with Imperial histories telling that during the Great Scouring members of the Dark Angels Legion launched a campaign against the ruling castes of Pervigilium, the Angels of Vigilance's future homeworld, have created speculations that they are of Dark Angels linage. Their Fortress Monastery is a huge orbital dock around the world Pervigilium, just outside the Cadian Gate. The Angels of Vigilance are especially good at fighting the forces of Chaos as they tend to encounter them during every Black Crusade, which traditionally enters Imperial territory through the Gate. Also, due to their proximity to the Eye of Terror, whenever the Cadian Gate becalms, they can be seen in their ships, moving into the Eye to fight the forces of Chaos in their own territory.
Blood Eagles	The Blood Eagles were a Blood Angels Successor Chapter. The chapter has since become extinct, due to an intra-chapter conflict that tore them apart. This conflict ravaged their homeworld and ended with the Blood Eagles being split into the Angels Numinous and Red Seraphs chapters. Their homeworld now sits as an empty monument to the Blood Eagles and generations can go by before anyone visits it. The only ones who do, though, are representatives of the Angels Numinous and Red Seraphs, who do so to honour ancient oaths the Blood Eagles swore to the Charnel Guard as part of the Triarchy. However, in the wake of the Great Rift's creation, all three Chapter's suffered greatly as they found themselves trapped within the Imperium Nihilus. After finding that their Chapters were beset on all sides in the most recent Triarchy meeting, the Charnel Guard's representative, Mordath, stated they should launch a final attack together. The others agreed and months later the might of the three Chapters united above the Blood Eagles' Homeworld. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Astral Fists	The Astral Fists are a Space Marine Chapter. In M42 they were moving out of sector to engage the Splinter Fleet Echidna.
Angels Penitent	The Angels Penitent are a Space Marine Chapter, formerly known as the Angels Resplendent. Though of an unclear Founding, the Angels Resplendent were founded in M34, putting them around the 8th or 9th Founding. Like many of the less bloodthirsty successors of the Blood Angels, the Angels Resplendent practiced a wide variety of artistic endeavours alongside their martial practice and training. It was common, almost expected, for brothers to be artists when not on campaign, with emphasis placed on painting, sculpting, and calligraphy. As each marine was expected to partake in some form of artistic expression, the action itself became semi-meditative and the marines often found themselves mentally grounded and secured by creating art. As a result, for several thousand years, they fielded little-to-no Death Company and it was believed the ritual act of creation helped the body and mind of the brothers. At some point during M41, Chapter Master Varzival took the 1st Company, the majority of the Librarians and many of the senior Chapter officers on a great crusade across the Imperium. During this time, the Chapter was left in the hands of the Chaplains and that is when the chapter changed forever. A stranger washed up on the shores of a river near the Chapter's Fortress Monastery, a tall and whip-cord thin man with a deep stomach scar and glowing eyes. The stranger was brought before the Chaplains and over the course of weeks and months he explained that the Chapter was hiding from the legacy of Sanguinius. The Chaplains would eventually accept his Lethean Revelation, declaring the man a prophet of the Emperor and that the Angels Resplendent were no more.
Trial by Blood (Anthology)	Trial by Blood is an anthology of short stories by Andy Smillie about the Flesh Tearers Space Marine Chapter published in December 2014. Gabriel Seth is on trial for his life, and for the very existence of his Chapter. The Flesh Tearers, scions of Sanguinius and cousins to the noble Blood Angels, stand accused of deviancy and brutality beyond that which can be tolerated. As Seth recounts his history of defending the Imperium, his judges – the Masters of other Blood Angels Successor Chapters – must decide the fate of the Flesh Tearers. In addition to the listed stories, the anthology features a framing story in four acts called The Trial of Gabriel Seth.
Angels of the Grail	The Angels of the Grail are a Space Marine Chapter.[1a]
Angels Encarmine	The Angels Encarmine are a Successor Chapter of the Blood Angels Legion and were created during the Second Founding. It is said that no Space Marine Chapter is as active as the Angels Encarmine. Their Chapter Master, Castellan Zargo, cannot rest at peace and so forever seeks opportunities to lead his Battle-Brothers on campaign. As a result, the Angels Encarmine are rarely at full strength, though what they lack in numbers is more than compensated for in determined fervour.[4b] Their Death Company is always worryingly high which only contributes to their manpower issues.
Angels of Repentance	The Angels of Repentance are a Space Marine Chapter. The Chapter's colours are blue, with black pauldrons and a white aquila. Company affiliation is designated by helmet colour. The Chapter's symbol is a robed figure carrying a sword, depicted in white against a black background.
Angels of Wrath	The Angels of Wrath are a Space Marine Chapter of Dark Angels ancestry and are part of the Unforgiven. The Chapter was almost completely destroyed by the Frateris Templars on the command of Goge Vandire, during the Age of Apostasy.[1a] During the Age of Apostasy Goge Vandire desired to have the Ecclesiarchy consolidate its power and bring institutions outside of their authority under their command. The Angels of Wrath, a relatively young Space Marine chapter were the first chosen to be brought under the Ecclesiarchy's power and messages were sent to Tristan Dare, Grand Master of the Chapter. Vandire demanded that the Angels of Wrath replace their Chaplains with Ecclesiarchy missionaries, which would allow them to be easier to control. Tristan and the Chapter immediately refused these demands - not wanting to have their ranks diluted by men who were not of their Gene-seed and who would divide their loyalty to the Emperor and their Primarch Lion El'Jonson. In doing so however they brought retribution from the Ecclesiarchy upon themselves.[1a] Wanting to set an example to those who opposed his will, Goge Vandire ordered a large warfleet to attack the Angels of Wrath's Homeworld and destroy the Chapter. Doom came to the Chapter when the sensors of their Fortress Monastery detected a large Imperial warfleet approaching their Homeworld. Armies of Frateris Templars were soon descending upon them and they were attacked by waves of zealots. Though the Angels of Wrath fought ferociously they were no match for the zealots, who overwhelmed the Chapter with their sheer numbers. Soon the walls of the Chapter's Fortress Monastery, their last stronghold on the planet, were breached and a tide of Frateris swarmed what was left of the Chapter. Five hours after the attack was launched, ninety percent of the Chapter had fallen to the Frateris Templars, including their Grand Master Tristan Dare, and their destruction was nearly complete.[1a]
Angels of Retribution	The Angels of Retribution were a Space Marine Chapter. The Angels of Retribution were involved in a disastrous ambush on the planet Alantor X, where they were completely destroyed. The Officio Assassinorum is believed to have somehow been involved in the Chapter's destruction.
Astral Hounds (Chapter)	The Astral Hounds are a Space Marine Chapter. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here. The Astral Hounds and the Tome Keepers were both created by the staff of White Dwarf in 2020, as candidates for becoming the mascot Chapter for the magazine. They ultimately chose the Tome Keepers, but the Astral Hounds were concepted out by the staff and some of the background ideas for the Chapter were re-used for the Tome Keepers.
Novamarines	The Novamarines are a Successor Chapter of the Ultramarines Legion, created during the Second Founding. "The existence of the Alien is a problem with but one solution; Extermination. When Mankind is alone in the cosmos, only then will we have achieved our destiny." The Novamarines are, with one apparent exception, hardline followers of the Codex Astartes, the great organisational work of the Ultramarines Primarch Roboute Guilliman. Their adherence to most aspects of the Codex is so strong that they have drawn the blood of those who would scorn it, as well as being noted as exemplars of Guilliman's writ by other Imperial authorities. This hardline attitude extends to other facets of Imperial thought, with the Novamarines being notable proponents of the monodominant philosophy; deviation from Imperial norms is considered anathema, with a particular disgust saved for xenos life-forms.
Angels of Absolution	The Angels of Absolution are a Second Founding Chapter of the Dark Angels.[5a] The structure and belief of the Angels of Absolution are still very similar to those of their progenitor chapter, to the point that the two chapters have often joined forces and pooled resources in the hunt of The Fallen[5b]. The only noticeable difference in their doctrines, is that the Angels of Absolution consider their own sins expunged by the actions of their loyalist forefathers during the Fall of Caliban. However they still considered themselves responsible for meting out punishment upon the Fallen and so the Angels of Absolution possess all the drive of the other Unforgiven Chapters, while not being weighed down by their guilt. This belief isn't shared amongst the other Unforgiven Chapters, but all strife seems to have been contained and they continue to cooperate with them. While they have formations similar to the Ravenwing and Deathwing companies they are not named as such.
Angels Puissant	The Angels Puissant are a Space Marine Chapter.
Angels of Fury	The Angels of Fury are a Codex Chapter of the Space Marines. The Angels of Fury are descended from the gene-seed of the Ultramarines. During their founding they were aided by battle-brothers selected from the Novamarines Chapter. The Angels of Fury wear white power armour with red pauldrons and chest imperialis.[1a]
Dolorous Guard	The Dolorous Guard are a Chaos Warband, within the Ten Thousand Eyes warhost[1a] They were once the loyal Ashen Blades Space Marine Chapter[1a], until its entire fleet was caught in a Warp Storm[1b] and ensnared by the forces of Chaos[1a]. Being trapped within the storm led the Ashen Blades to fight amongst themselves and during it, the Chapter's Master of Sanctity was killed by the Chaplain Jai'tana. When they later finally freed themselves[1b], the surviving Ashen Blades that emerged from the Warp Storm had all been corrupted into worshiping Chaos.[1a] The high ranking officer Markog was among the survivors[1b] and created the Dolorous Guard from the ruins of the Ashen Blades. Eventually though, the Guard joined the Ten Thousand Eyes and became the bodyguards of the warhost's master, Seraphax.[1a]
Angels Repentant	The Angels Repentant are a Space Marine Chapter.
Astral Hawks	The Astral Hawks are a Space Marine Chapter.
Aquiloan Brotherhood	The Aquiloan Brotherhood are an Ultramarines Successor Chapter and one of the 10 Shield Chapters of Ultramar.
Angels Revenant	The Angels Revenant are a Space Marine Chapter. The Angels Revenant earned glory and honour for their participation in the Great Purge of the Jakart Cluster and Occlusiad War. For their role in Saint Marduk's War of Faith in the Orpheus Sector, the Chapter was gifted the planet Libethra as its homeworld. As stern supporters of the Imperial Creed, the Chapter was also allowed access to all the resources of the Orpheus Sector to build its fortress-monastery and to recruit from the feral world Patara. The presence of the Angels Revenant provided resolve and security for the sector. They guarded the pilgrimage routes of the Cold Veil and hunted pirates and xenos raiders in the Hesod Nebula and Barren Stars. The Angels Revenant defended their homeworld from a sudden attack by the Necron Maynarkh Dynasty before 3086991.M41. They fought to the last, unleashing extreme close-range bombardment cannon strikes on at least one tomb ship. The Necrons appeared to have cracked the planet open and drowned the Angels Revenant in magma to finally destroy them. When news of the Chapter's annihilation reached the Synod Tempestus, it declared a Segmentum-wide day of requiem. The bells of a thousand worlds tolled to mark their passing. Only a few hundred battle-brothers were away from Libethra on crusades when the world was destroyed.
Ashen Conquerors	The Ashen Conquerors are a Space Marine Chapter. They are among the Imperial host that began a war to destroy the Chaos Knight Houses Araknis and Skorpiod in M42. They are currently among the Host's forces that are invading the Chaos Houses' Homeworld Aranae
Angels of Defiance	The Angels of Defiance are a Dark Angels Successor Chapter. Founded in the darkest hour of the Noctis Aeterna, the Angels of Defiance have inherited their Primarch's legendary tenacity and his Legion's ability to bear great suffering to achieve victory. Since their creation, the Chapter has become a beacon of hope beneath the pall of despair and have earned many commendations during the Indomitus Crusade.
How to Paint Space Marines	How to Paint Space Marines is an instructional book published in 2004 of techniques on how to paint various Space Marine miniatures of different chapters. It also provides background information on how codex chapters are organized. How to Paint Space Marines is part of the "How To..." series of books from Games Workshop which includes:
Ultima Founding	A Founding is an occasion when several new Space Marine Chapters are created.[11c] A Founding does not occur at any set interval, but is ordered when it is deemed necessary. As Chapters are occasionally completely destroyed, Foundings are often meant to ensure that a thousand Chapters exist at a time. This also means that many Chapters are created during unstable times of strife and rebellions that have caused many Chapters to lose the knowledge of their Founding or even the millennia of that Founding.[11d] This is especially common to Chapters created before or during Age of Apostasy as during the Reign of Blood many Imperial records were shamelessly destroyed forever.[11c] Space Marine Chapters have been created outside of official Foundings, however. Exceptions to Foundings include the creation of the Grey Knights who were created before the Second Founding by order of the Emperor Himself during the Horus Heresy, the Sons of Medusa, who were ratified by unprecedented edict in 011.M37,[3c] and the Red Seraphs as well as Angels Numinous which represent splinter factions of the Blood Eagles.
Angels Arisen	The Angels Arisen are a Space Marine Chapter.
Andromedan Blades	The Andromedan Blades are a Space Marine Chapter. Six Companies of the Chapter served in the Indomitus Crusade' Battle Group Kallides, under the command of Chapter Master Karyas Kaeso. They later aided the Battlegroup in the war against the Necrons in the Pariah Nexus.
Angels of Iron	The Angels of Iron are a Space Marine Chapter.
Angels Vermillion	The Angels Vermillion are a Successor Chapter of the Blood Angels. While most successors of the Blood Angels maintain close ties with one another and their parent Chapter, the Angels Vermillion have resolved to bear their curse alone.[6a] The Angels Vermillion shun all contact with their brother and parent Chapters, and bear their curse in solitude. While Imperial Records of the Chapter's exploits since the Second Founding have been nothing short of exemplary, one wonders about the cause of their self-imposed exile from their brethren, and whether it is simply a shame that must be endured alone, or something darker.[4b] The Chapters isolation is not entirely a self-imposed one. Even in the desperate days of the Imperium Nihilus, Dante has refused all appeals to forge closer links with the Chapter.
Chapter	A Chapter is a self-contained Space Marine army usually made up of a thousand or so Space Marines, as well as a large number of administrative and functionary personnel. The Adeptus Astartes is divided into roughly a thousand Chapters. Each constituent Chapter is autonomous and constitutes a complete army, with its own leadership, support and administrative staff, reliant only on its own Chapter members. Each chapter has its own traditions, specialties, its own cult, beliefs and practices. Chapters were originally an organisational unit used by the Thunder Warriors. During the Great Crusade, the Space Marines were organised into Legions, further divided into Companies. Chapters were adopted by some of the Legions as an intermediate level of organisation.[2b] The Ultramarines Legion, led by Roboute Guilliman, became the largest of all the Legions, thanks to Guilliman's tactical mastery and a steady flow of new recruits from Ultramar.[1a] At the time of the Horus Heresy, the Ultramarines Legion was divided into twenty-five Chapters, each composed of ten Companies, each company composed of roughly one thousand Marines.[2a]
Angels of PurgatThe	The Angels of Purgatory are a Space Marine Chapter.
The Long Games at Carcharias (Short Story)	An attack on their fortress-monastery leaves the Crimson Consuls Space Marines scattered, broken and close to destruction. As they struggle to defeat the Black Legion invaders, the Chapter's masters must also contend with treachery and an ancient daemonic threat.
Atlantian Spears	The Atlantian Spears are a Blood Angels Successor Chapter. The Atlantian Spears have little engagement with others of the Blood. The Chapter is known to have a large Librarius and an unusual number of their Librarians have the gift of foresight to call upon. For millennia, the Atlantian Spears have relied upon these powers, as they fought to pacify Segmentum Tempestus's vast Enclave of Alkina and Sanctuary of Konstantyah. The Spears are so focused on battling the innumerable xenos and heretic threats in those regions, that they chose to ignore the Blood Angels' plea for aid, prior to the Devastation of Baal.
White Dwarf 467	White Dwarf is Games Workshop's premium Warhammer magazine, packed with amazing content each month such as new rules and background, short stories, regular columns, special guests and more. WARHAMMER QUEST: CURSED CITY Each physical copy of Issue 467 includes a double-sided Warhammer Age of Sigmar Quick Reference Sheet.
Adulators	The Adulators are a Space Marine Chapter. The chapter is steeped in the ways of the Ecclesiarchy and are on close terms with their holy orders.[2b] The Adulators are known to have contributed to the defence of the Ras subsector, in particular the Shrine World of Ras Shakeh, at one point. Unfortunately they were rendered unable to continue their support in late M41, as they were stretched to the breaking point by other commitments.[2a][2b]
Argent Swords	The Argent Swords are a Space Marine Chapter. Elements of the Chapter briefly served alongside the White Consuls, under the command of Captain Messinius.
Angels Sanguine	Ours is the blood of Sanguinius and ours is the honour of the Angels— Brother Captain Vitaro of the Angels Sanguine[7a] The Angels Sanguine are a Successor Chapter of the Blood Angels. They were created during the Second Founding and were composed of those Blood Angels that were considered the most glorious and faithful to the image of their Primarch Sanguinius. Before the Angels Sanguine were sent to forge their own history, the Sanguinary Priests of the new Successor Chapters were gathered and presented with the Red Grail of the Blood Angels. Within the Red Grail was what remained of the blood of their Primarch and the newly anointed Sanguinary Priests were required to drink from it; thus the blood and vitality of Sanguinius would be preserved in the bodies of his children in these successor Chapters.
Angels of Light	The Angels of Light are a Blood Angels Successor Chapter. Like Baal, their Homeworld Naraka is a savage world, where children are taught to kill at a young age. But just like the Blood Angels, the Angels of Light rise above this to become warriors worthy of their Primarch Sanguinius. The Chapter's entire Third Company was destroyed in battle with the Eldar, four years before the Devastation of Baal began.
Astartes Praeses	The Astartes Praeses were twenty Space Marine Chapters whose main task was to guard the frontiers of the Eye of Terror. By the time of the 13th Black Crusade, the Astartes Praeses numbered eighteen; one of them has been destroyed and another declared excommunicatus traitorus. According to the Mythos Angelica Mortis were those chapters founded with the expressed purpose of guarding the regions surrounding the Eye of Terror. Thanks to the judgement of Saint Basillius, many of the chapters were sent into the Eye of Terror. In the immediate aftermath of the Abyssal Crusade, the region was wrecked, leading to a perpetual state of siege in the region from then on known Cadian Gate.
Angels Redeemed	The Angels Redeemed are a Space Marine Chapter.
Angels of Penance	The Angels of Penance are a Space Marine Chapter.
Astral Bears	The Astral Bears are a White Scars Successor Chapter. The Astral Bears were created during the Ultima Founding, but have already won many great victories, that bring honor to their Primarch Jaghatai's memory.
Angels of Fire	The Angels of Fire are a Space Marine Chapter of unknown origin.
Watchguards	The Watchguards are a Space Marine Chapter. During the Thirteenth Black Crusade, the Chapter sent six of its Companies to aid in defending Cadia from Abaddon the Despoiler's invading forces. It is not known how many of the Watchguards escaped from the Fortress World before it was destroyed.
Desert Lions	The Desert Lions are a Space Marine Chapter.[1a] Saul Liamson - Legio Cybernetica Tech-Adept. Partook in Operation Carthage.[1b] Desert Lions echelon left point defense maniple mops up in the closing stages of Operation Carthage. After eliminating the perimeter forts, the Robot cohort provided extra support for the advancing Rhinos. Subsequent resistance to Imperial forces was minimal.
Drakes Radiant	The Drakes Radiant are a Salamanders Successor Chapter. They spread the Emperor's divinity using unique flame-based weapons, such as fire-coasted blades. However the Drakes Radiant also have a fanatical dedication to an ever-burning fire, known as the Perpetual Flame as well. They are now being investigated by the Inquisition because of this.

The Blood Angels, originally known as the Revenant Legion[44b] were the IX Legion of the original Space Marine Legions under their Primarch Sanguinius. They are particularly well known for their bloodthirsty nature in battle. They are also one of the most long-lived Chapters, and have a refined aesthetic sense.[1h] The homeworld of the Blood Angels is the planet Baal and its two moons, Baal Primus and Baal Secundus, from which the Blood Angels take their new recruits. The Blood Angels' Primarch, Sanguinius, fell upon Baal Secundus after he and his brother Primarchs were scattered across the galaxy.[4c]

The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Celestials	The Celestials are an Imperial Fists Successor Chapter.
Chapter Approved 2001	Chapter Approved 2001 was subtitled The Second Book of the Astronomican in reference to the original Book of the Astronomican, as it continued the series of books that collected the most popular and significant developments for the game published in White Dwarf Magazine.
White Scars	The White Scars (known to themselves as the Ordu of Jaghatai[26b]), originally known as the Star Hunters[26a] were the V Legion of the original twenty Space Marine Legions of the First Founding. Their Primarch is Jaghatai Khan. During the Horus Heresy the White Scars remained loyal to the Emperor, after which they reorganised and split into Chapters. Drawing on the tribal savagery of their homeworld, the White Scars practice a highly mobile method of warfare, tearing into their enemies with lightning-quick attacks and vanishing before a response can be made. Despite being characterised as barbarians, the White Scars are a highly cultured Chapter, with poetry among their most respected and ancient traditions.[18a] Khorchin is the variation of Gothic spoken on the White Scars home planet, sometimes called Chogorian. The White Scars were the V Legion of Space Marine Legions created by the Emperor. They first saw action during the Unification Wars on Terra, held apart from their brothers and rarely found in massed armies. Recruits were primarily drawn from the ice wastes of the Thulean Basin. They were nonetheless one of the first Legions to see action in the name of the Emperor, fighting alongside the older Thunder Warriors. The early Vth Legion was given the solitary duty of seeking out the hidden lairs of many demagogues and warlords that ruled Terra. Their superhuman physiology allowed them to survive in the most radiation-contaminated areas of the planet and operate deep in enemy territory to scout and harass. In these early days, the Legion numbered only a few hundred warriors and frequently weakened the enemy in preparation for the arrival of the Emperor's main armies.[28a] During this time the V Legion was a Legion only in name as they were divided into several small autonomous pioneer companies of 500-3,000 Space Marines. Each of these Pioneer Companies had few links to any of their brethren and operated entirely independently. None of these companies had much contact with the other and each developed its own rituals, recruitment zones, and traditions. During this time they often operated alongside other larger Space Marine Legions, sometimes adopting the traditions of their brothers in arms in absence of their own Primarch. These non-Chogorian traditions would live on even after the discovery of Jaghatai, and it proved a way for Warrior Lodges to become strong within the future White Scars. As the Great Crusade progressed, the V Legion Pioneer Companies recruited as they traveled and a great diversity of Aspirants were drawn from worlds other than Terra.[38b]
Angels Erythrean	The Angels Erythrean are a Blood Angels Successor Chapter. They were created as a fail-safe by the Blood Angels, in case the Imperium ever turned upon the Sons of Sanguinius. One reason being their blood drinking rituals and Gene-seed curses could have them labeled as heretical deviants, by the Inquisition or Ecclesiarchy. Should that occur, the Angels Erythrean would be alive to continue their Primarch Sanguinius' bloodline and heritage. However in order to ensure that occurred, the newly created Chapter was sent into the Ghoul Stars and ordered to not make contact with any Imperial forces. As time went on afterwards, future generations of the Sons of Sanguinius forgot all about the Angels Erythrean's existence. The Fleet Based Chapter, though, not only remembers their purpose, but also fights to prevent any threats within the unexplored eastern galaxy from reaching the Imperium. Their task is made difficult, however, due to the Angels Erythrean's self-exile, which prevents them from easily obtaining the resources other Chapters have access to. Because of this, the Erythrean rely on copied or surviving fragments of technology to continue functioning, which all resides on their fleet's flagship. The Angels Erythrean have also resorted to inducting sub-Human Aspirants into their Chapter and use their technology to turn them into fully functioning Space Marines. The Erythrean's Priests meanwhile, are always faced with the dilemma of whether the process has successfully freed these new Angels of any possible taint they may have possessed. While the Chapter can do nothing about that problem, the Angels Erythrean have long resorted to raiding and reaving, in order to gather resources. This includes targeting their fellow Imperials and ships have gone missing, after being attacked by the Erythrean. They also have managed to make trading deals with their fellow exiles the Carcharodons, as well as other nomad predation forces that dwell in the eastern darkness beyond the Imperium's realm. It is through these various means, that the Angels Erythrean obtained the material needed for them to be able to create Primaris Space Marines on their own.
Lost Chapter	Lost Chapters are Space Marine Chapters that have been destroyed. Some were annihilated in one sudden strike, while others were slowly diminished through attrition, being unable for whatever reason to recruit new marines fast enough to replace combat losses. Information about such chapters is often lost during the millennia and all-too scarce. They should not to be confused with Renegade Chapters or Chaos Space Marine forces, who have been declared Excommunicate Traitoris by the Inquisition and/or the High Lords of Terra. These forces technically still exist but have gone rogue, breaking their vows of loyalty towards the Imperium. Some of them simply fell to Chaos, others are idealistic rebels who rejected the all-too oppressive Imperial authority for some reason.
Fire Angels	The Fire Angels are a Space Marine Chapter descended from the Ultramarines that have a zealous devotion to the Imperial Creed.[1b] The Fire Angels were created from Ultramarines gene-seed. They fought on the loyalist side during the Badab War. In one incident during the war, the rebel Astral Claws launched a suicidal counter-attack, in which a squadron of Rhinos broke through an Imperial salient to the Fire Angels' lines and detonated a virus missile, causing more deaths in one day than the Fire Angels had suffered in the war so far.[Needs Citation] The Fire Angels are a highly zealous chapter. Fervent believers in the Imperial creed, they do not revere their ancestral primarch as many chapters do, believing this to be a form of idolatry. They tend to rely on "basic" Imperial technology and codex equipment, such as Rhinos and Predators, while their 1st Company is mostly composed of Sternguard Veterans rather than Terminators.[1b] Despite this, their armoury on Lorin Alpha is sophisticated enough to churn out large amounts of tanks such as the Predator, Vindicator, and Whirlwind, which the Fire Angels wield disproportionate numbers of.[1a]

Warped Stars (Short Story)	Jomi Jabal has an imaginary friend who helps him make sense of the universe. Except Jomi's friend isn't imaginary, and he's coming to visit very, very soon...
Astral Crusaders	The Astral Crusaders are a Space Marine Chapter. During the Psychic Awakening, the Sisters of Silence requested that the Astral Crusaders, Black Templars and the Griffons of Repentance Chapters aid them in the Choralynth Trace. Parts of the Trace's population were beginning to rebel and the Sisters needed the Chapters' help in finding the sinister beings leading them, before a full scale uprising began.
The Crown of Thorns (Short Story)	The Crown of Thorns is an Angels Penitent short story by Peter Fehervari. It was first published online in September 2013. "For many long years, the Angels Resplendent protected humanity in the Emperor's name. But they are no longer resplendent, their purity and zeal turned inwards. Now the Angels Penitent, they are ruled by the Crown of Thorns, who punish any brother who dares to break their edicts. As Brother Montaig considers just such an act, he wonders how bad the punishment could be..." Occurring a decade after the Angels Resplendent became the Angels Penitent, Brother-Sergeant Montaig attempts to help Neophyte Phelion flee the judgement of the Crown of Thorns whilst reflecting on the changes the Chapter has undergone since the arrival of the Undying Martyr.
Astral Castellans	The Astral Castellans are a Space Marine Chapter. In white two crossed swords, cantoned of four regular octagram stars, on blue.
Space Marine	They shall be my finest warriors, these men who give themselves to me. Like clay I shall mould them and in the furnace of war forge them. They will be of iron will and steely muscle. In great armour shall I clad them and with the mightiest guns will they be armed. They will be untouched by plague or disease, no sickness will blight them. They will have tactics, strategies and machines such that no foe can best them in battle. They are my bulwark against the Terror. They are the Defenders of Humanity. They are my Space Marines and they shall know no fear.--The Emperor of Mankind. The Adeptus Astartes (commonly known as Space Marines, and colloquially as Angels of Death) are one of the most elite and feared fighting forces in the Imperium of Man. The primary unit of organisation in the 41st millennium is the Chapter, a self-contained army fully equipped with its own transport, non-combatant support staff, etc. There are around a thousand Chapters, each comprising a thousand Space Marines. There are far too few Space Marines to form the Imperium's main military forces; instead they operate as highly mobile strike forces. They are entrusted with the most dangerous missions, such as lightning raids behind enemy lines, infiltration, and tunnel fighting. Through selection, training, and conditioning, Marines are physically, mentally, and spiritually superior to any other Imperial soldier. Originating from the Thunder Warriors, the first Space Marines were created from the genetic material of the Primarchs after they were spirited away from the Emperor by the Gods of Chaos in the aftermath of the Unification Wars. Twenty Legions of Space Marines were created, each from the genetic material of a specific Primarch. The first Astartes were created only by the massive effort of the Emperor and countless Terran scientists of Amar Astarte's Biotechnical Division who worked deep within the Himalazia Mountains. The original Astartes gene-seed was unstable and caused its subjects to degrade rapidly, but once it was stabilized by samples provided by newly rediscovered Primarchs, long-term stability was achieved.
Wolf Brothers	The Wolf Brothers, created during the Second Founding, were the only known Successor Chapter of the Space Wolves Legion until the Ultima Founding. The Chapter was later disbanded by the Inquisition due to genetic instability, specifically the Wulfen gene-mutation that can manifest itself in Space Wolves.[5a] Little is known of the Wolf Brothers beyond the facts that upon their Founding they were issued with exactly half of the Space Wolves fleet, arms/equipment and priests available at that time,[5a] and were intended to be the first off-shoot Chapter created from the Space Wolves as part of a grand plan to create a force termed the Sons of Russ, who would be posted in a galactic circle around the Eye of Terror in an attempt to prevent the Traitor Legions from ever invading the Imperium. However, the swift degradation of their genetic viability quickly made it clear that the gene-seed of the Space Wolves was almost impossible to use to create another Chapter, and the Sons of Russ plan died alongside the Wolf Brothers.[5a]
Colossi of Kronos	The Colossi of Kronos are a Space Marine Chapter, that is also a member of the Wardens of the Gauntlet. So far, its forces in the Gauntlet have destroyed 3 of the Black Legion's capital-class warships, though the Colossi have also lost four-fifths of their own fleet.
Angels Vindicant	The Angels Vindicant are a Space Marine Chapter. The Angels Vindicant were present at Honour's End, an event occurring during a campaign on the Shrine World of Lucid Prime. They fought alongside the Space Wolves and Flesh Tearers, scouring Chaos Space Marines from the hive city of Ratspire; however, the ferocity of the Flesh Tearers' tactics led to open combat between the chapters present.

Angels Porphyr	The Angels Porphyr are a Chapter of the Space Marines, founded in M31. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Angels Numinous	The Angels Numinous are a Blood Angels Successor Chapter. They are part of the Triarchy. The Angels Numinous are not a traditional Founding Chapter, as they emerged in a murderous civil war which tore the Blood Eagles Chapter apart. Alongside another splinter faction, the Red Seraphs, they represent the survivors of the Blood Eagles. Despite this background, both the Angels Numinous as well as Red Seraphs upheld the ancient vows of their parent chapter, including their membership in the Triarchy. They call the Emperor as Padizhah, and show him every respect. They are known to have little regard for their Battle Brothers afflicted with the Black Rage, as the Chapter believes that only the weak fall into its embrace. As a result of this, the Angels Numinous refuse to honour their Death Companies, as the Blood Angels do, and instead consider them to be nothing, but a shameful embarrassment to their pure and noble Chapter[2b]. When the Angels Numinous go to battle, the Death Companies are hurled into the fray with no concern for their lives and are simply used as a blunt instrument to break enemy front lines.
Invaders	The Invaders are a fleet-based Codex Chapter descended from the Imperial Fists. The Invaders excel in planetary subjugation, crushing resistance through massed aerial and orbital attack. Their tactics require reliance on Scout and Tactical squads to secure landing zones and staging areas, while squads of Vanguard Veterans and Terminators crush centres of resistance. The most famous engagement of the chapter occurred in 852.M41, when they launched a direct assault upon Eldar Craftworld Idharae. Despite suffering horrific casualties during this bold attack, the Invaders were successful; Idharae was left a ruined and desolate hulk. But the chapter was not done with the Eldar. Forty-three years later, with the Invaders still rebuilding, Craftworld Alaitoc launched a retaliatory assault on the chapter's homeworld Ogrys. Without the numbers to defend their fortress-monastery, the Invaders were quickly overcome. Only three companies survived the attack, and the Invaders became a spacebound chapter. Still under-strength after their all-out assault, and the retaliatory attack, the Invaders chapter is reported as operating in a support role to the Novamarines on the doomed planet of Skyfall.
Aurora Chapter	The Aurora Chapter is a Chapter of Space Marines formed from the Ultramarines Legion during the Second Founding. Like all descendants of the Ultramarines, they are strict followers of the Codex Astartes. During the Great Crusade and Horus Heresy, the 4th Chapter of the Ultramarines Legion was known as the Aurorans. They possessed five times as many armoured vehicles as a standard Chapter.[13a] The 4th Chapter also used non-standard iconography, using the color green to mark veterans and marking its members with the so-called "Auroran Ribbon", a sign which later became the Aurora Chapter's symbol. In 007.M31, the 4th Chapter was among the Ultramarines units mustered on Calth. It was mainly deployed on the planet's continent of Ithraca. There, it was drawn into the apocalyptic Betrayal of Ithraca, fighting alongside the 24th Ultramarines Chapter, Legio Praesagius, and other loyalists against the Word Bearers, Legio Suturvora, and other Chaos followers. The 4th Chapter suffered massive losses at Ithraca City,[13d][13e] but rallied under Sub-Captain Mantargo and helped to hold back the traitors before being forced to retreat due to the mass emergence of daemons.[13f][13g]

Swords of Praesium	The Swords of Praesium are a Space Marine Chapter. When Chaos forces attacked the Imperium world of Acropolis Vega, two Companies from the Swords of Praesium launched a counter-attack. Not long after they made planetfall, however, a Warpstorm engulfed the system; this cut Acropolis Vega off from the Imperium for nearly 70 years. Isolated and almost certainly overwhelmed by their opposition, several squads from the two Companies swore their loyalty to Chaos in return for their survival. When the Warpstorm finally abated, those squads had formed the Chaos Space Marine Warband known as the Swords of Khargoth and led the attack upon the Imperial reclamation fleet sent to Acropolis Vega.
Emperor's Hawks	The Emperor's Hawks are a Codex Chapter of Space Marines. The Emperor's Hawks specialize in jump pack-assisted assaults, followed by squadron-strength units of Land Speeders.[Needs Citation] This article needs work on its citations.For help on citation see the citation guidelines.

Emperor's Wolves	The Emperor's Wolves are a Space Marine Chapter. The 8th company of the chapter was lost in a Warp jump, but reappeared decades later as the Blood Disciples, having dedicated themselves to the powers of Chaos.
Brazen Fists	The Brazen Fists are a Space Marine Chapter[1a].
Void Sabres	The Void Sabres are a Raven Guard Successor Chapter, that was created during the Ultima Founding. Its initial members served in Indomitus Crusade Fleet Primus' Unnumbered Sons and were grouped with those descended from the Primarch Corax. They were then among those Unnumbered Sons who were charged with leveling the city of Olda, during the early years of the Indomitus Crusade, as Fleet Primus' forces invaded its world. The group succeeded in doing so with such efficiency, that Lord Commander Guilliman awarded them by forming the survivors into the Void Sabres. The Chapter's creation was then officially conducted into the Ultima Founding, in a ceremony that was personally overseen by Lord Guilliman himself. During the course of the ceremony, the Lord Commander congratulated them and told them that Olda's world would now serve as their Homeworld, as recognition of their deeds. He then remarked that the Void Sabres would not only be charged with protecting it, but also their world's System and its surrounding Sectors as well. He then called forth the Chapter's officers, and they recited their oaths of loyalty to the Imperium, which were written down in Guilliman's personal copy of the Index Astartes. Their personal heraldries and the Void Sabres' Chapter symbol were also recorded, before its Standards were then presented to them. The ceremony was then concluded and Guilliman returned to Indomitus Crusade Fleet Primus' fleet, while the new Chapter traveled to the site of their future Fortress Monastery, which would soon begin to be built. This was all recorded by the Logos Historica Verita and by Fabian Guelphrain's count, the Void Sabres were the 104th Chapter to be created since the Ultima Founding began.
Consecrators	The Consecrators are a Successor Chapter to the Dark Angels dedicated to uncovering the secrets of the past.[3b] The founding of the Consecrators was initiated in secret by Dark Angels Supreme Grand Master Valafar for the purpose of seeking out and preserving the history of the Unforgiven[3c]. Prior to the 3rd century of the 40th millennium there is no record of their existence. They appear to have inherited the most revered arms of the Dark Angels Legion, preserving them carefully through the ages. They bear a close resemblance to the Dark Angels before the Horus Heresy, maintaining the Legion's original black colour and (prior too recieving Primaris reinforcements), wearing ancient patterns power armour no newer than Mark 6 "Corvus". They have their own agenda and soon disappear after their mysterious objectives are complete. Most of their wargear are ancient relics, taken from rediscovered Legiones Astartes depots and armouries. They are known to have sent several missions into the ruins of Caliban in their quest for ancient heirlooms of the Legion[3b]. The Consecrators use these relics in their hunt for Fallen Angels, by planting them in closely monitored locations and waiting for the relics' presence to become known. Once the Fallen are aware of the relics, some try to claim these treasures against their better judgement. Whether driven by vanity, spite or a longing for things lost, the Consecrators ensure these Fallen pay the ultimate price for their indiscretion.
Aurora Talons	The Aurora Talons are a Space Marine Chapter. They are known to operate a specialist rank known as Master Bombardier, maintaining no less than five in their Chapter Command.
Exorcists	The Exorcists are a Space Marine Chapter with a particular speciality in combating Daemons and the forces of Chaos. The Exorcists are a Space Marine Chapter with a very dubious founding history. A highly secretive and silent chapter, little is known about their early days. On the subject of their creation, a single communication remains, and was sent from a Genetor-Major of the Xenobiologis core, named Lauram Clelland. The Exorcists were formed as a successor chapter of the Imperial Fists at the end of M35, or early M36, in the Thirteenth Founding (The Dark Founding). Created from resilient Gene-Seed stock, in the early years of the Chapter they proved adaptable to many strategic challenges. However, the fate of the Chapter dramatically changed after the events on Totem IV. During the campaign to liberate the planet from Daemons under the control of the Lord of Change Keriath the Shrouded, the Exorcists proved resilient against hordes of Tzeentchian Daemons. Taking heavy physical damage but able to overcome the mental assaults of the Warp, at the height of the battle Chapter Master Enoch Trismegistus was possessed by Keriath. However, Trismegistus was able to use the possession to awaken his own psychic abilities, reaching into the mind of Chief Librarian Goetos and gaining his aid in driving the Daemon out. Keriath was subsequently banished back to the Warp.
Absolvers	The Absolvers are a Space Marine Chapter known to be enigmatic and dour. Though the Absolvers are a Successor Chapter of the Blood Angels geneseed,[6c] Absolvers themselves never share this information with other organisations of the Imperium.[6d] Very often, even the Absolvers' aspirants do not know which Primarch's gene-seed they have.[6c] This has led to organisations outside the Chapter often speculating as to who exactly the Progenitor of the Absolvers is, suggesting the Ultramarines (since the Absolvers strictly adhere to the Codex Astartes)[6e], the Raven Guard, the Space Wolves or even the White Scars.[6d] The Absolvers themselves hide their origin not because they are ashamed of Sanguinius (because they believe that he was a mightiest hero of mankind), but on the contrary - believing that they are unworthy to be called his sons, and that only through a long and painstaking process of absolution will they be able to reveal this knowledge to the whole world.[6c]
Crimson Lament	The Crimson Lament are a Space Marine Chapter. They are known to have a strong fleet of warships. This allowed the Crimson Lament to be among the few Chapters, that could attack Abaddon the Despoiler's Balefleets without the aid of other Imperial forces.
Silver Stars	The Silver Stars were a Space Marine Chapter declared lost under unclear circumstances. It has been suggested that the chapter failed to collect enough gene-seed and was therefore unable to replace its battle losses.
Renegade Space Marine	Renegade Space Marines are Space Marines who have turned their back on the Imperium but have yet to fall to the taint of Chaos, differentiating them from Chaos Space Marines. Desertion amongst the ranks of the Adeptus Astartes is extremely uncommon. However, when a Space Marine Chapter is overstretched, it is impossible for Chaplains to monitor every battle-brother. Isolated, Space Marines on extended duties can become divorced from the Chapter's teachings and feel their skills are wasted or their dedication overlooked. Growing thoughts of doubt manifest, and without reassurance from Chaplains or comradely from his battle-brothers, a Space Marine might then decide he has sacrificed enough for Mankind and turn to more selfish goals. Freed from the dogma and traditions of their Chapter, Renegade Space Marines fully indulge in their superhuman abilities and warrior minds and are capable of great mayhem. Most Renegade Space Marines become pirates and brigands, but some may rule over worlds or entire systems, while others may work as mercenaries. Some, like the Soul Drinkers, may still fight the forces of Chaos and even remain loyal to the Emperor but are otherwise free from the Adeptus Terra. However, while Renegade Chapters may initially have little to do with the Gods of Chaos, they will almost inevitably turn to them at some point in order to obtain more power. From this point on, they are doomed to become dreaded Chaos Space Marines.
Brazen Skulls	The Brazen Skulls are a Space Marine Chapter. The Chapter supported Saint Sabbat in her conquest of the Sabbat Worlds. By 773.M41 the Brazen Skulls were known to be extinct. However in M42, the Chapter was reborn during the Ultima Founding and consists entirely of Primaris Space Marines. These new Brazen Skulls are determined to live up to the honor of their forebears and have swiftly earned a reputation for heroism, tenacity and all-consuming hatred for the forces of Chaos.
Death Wardens	The Death Wardens are a Blood Angels Successor Chapter. They are the defenders of a Shrine World, located in the Eastern Fringe, that was dedicated to the Primarch Sanguinius after he tread upon its surface during the Great Crusade. The people there religiously worship the Angel and the Death Wardens began to defend the world in M31, before the rise of the Ecclesiarchy. The Chapter now ensures that the Ecclesiarchy does not try to change the Shrine World, so that it falls in line with the Imperial Cult. The Death Wardens were created during the Third Founding and their initial members were provided by the Blood Angels, Blood Drinkers, Flesh Tearers, Angels Numinous, Angels Sanguine and the Angels Encarmine. This included a command officer taken from each Chapter, which consisted of a Chapter Master, his Sanguinary Guard, a Chief Librarian, Sanguinary High Priest, High Chaplain and a First Captain. These command officers, however, were survivors of the Horus Heresy and had knowledge of the battle for the Signus Cluster and where it was located. This knowledge soon became a secret held by the Death Wardens and by tradition it became known only to its Chapter command, except for the Mechanicus trained Master of the Forge. Though in order to keep such secrets from outsiders, such as the Inquisition, this knowledge is not written down. Instead, when a member of the command dies their body is eaten by their successor, to ensure the secrets of the Signus Cluster are passed on.

Company of the Shadow	The Company of the Shadow are a Chaos Warband, who were originally the Death Falcons Chapter.[1b] Their Heresy began during the Fall of Bastonbeil, when an ancient and terrible creature rose from the Underhive of Bastonbeil's capital. The creature soon began to feed upon the souls of the living and devoured millions of Bastonbeil's citizens. As it was a prime recruiting world for the Death Falcons, they responded with their entire Chapter, and battled the mindless zombies left by the creature, before hunting for the beast itself.[1b] It is not known what occurred in the dark depths of the capital's underhive, but three months later, the Death Falcons were no more. Instead, the Company of the Shadow emerged, wearing grey power armour that writhed with the faces of the damned. Storming the upper reaches of the capital hive, the Warband overthrew the Imperial Commander, and took control of Bastonbeil.[1b]
Genesis Chapter	The Genesis Chapter are a Successor Chapter of the Ultramarines Legion, created during the Second Founding. First amongst the Primogenitors, the Genesis Chapter are dogmatically loyal to the memory of Roboute Guilliman, and can be counted upon to fight at the Ultramarines' side without hesitation.[1a][13c] They have the honour of being the first of the primogenitors and were formed from the noblest Ultramarines veterans who survived the Horus Heresy. Upon their inception, their first battle wrested the planet Newfound from the Word Bearers. The Genesis Chapter is one of the closest chapters doctrinally and astrographically to the Ultramarines, often undertaking joint operations. The Genesis Chapter Space Marines also routinely fill the gaps in the Ultramarine companies if they fall below Codex strength, or fill specialist positions such as the Librarius or Forge staff.[13c] Its Space Marines commonly undertake at least one pilgrimage to the Shrine of the Primarch. The Genesis Chapter's Chaplains regard the Codex Astartes as sacrosanct, going to great lengths to ensure that the Chapter adheres to its tenets, and any point of contention is debated thoroughly with recourse to the opinions of the Ultramarines' Chaplains for final ratification in order to ensure there is no doctrinal drift between the Ultramarines and the Genesis chapter.

Like the other loyalist Legions, much of the Iron Hands forces would later, according to the dictates of the Codex Astartes, be re-organized into smaller Chapters. The Iron Hands are notable for their heavy use of bionics and their reverence for all things mechanical, and thus their close ties to the Adeptus Mechanicus. Medusa is located near the Eye of Terror. Its landscape is harsh and generally unstable, with massive tectonic shifts occurring on a regular basis. Medusa is not united by any single government, but instead is populated by disparate clans of miners living out of great tracked vehicles travelling in caravans. There are only two notable locations on Medusa: a volcano known as Karaashi, which was the location of the arrival of Ferrus Manus on the planet, and the Land of Shadows. The Land of Shadows is populated only by ghostly relics of ages past and is said to be haunted by the spirits of Medusans long dead; those who go there only go in order to become supplicants to the Iron Hands' recruitment process.

They instinctively trusted their fellow Space Wolves as brothers and those Greyshields who shared a similar disposition found further common ground. These groupings of similar Greyshields, would later form the nucleus of new Space Wolves Successor Chapters. The esoteric Icefangs were among them, as their nucleus was formed of many of Crusade Fleet Primus's psychically inclined Space Wolves Greyshields..

Whilst a rescue mission was mounted, Land Speeder Typhoons from the Night Hawks conducted non-stop sorties throughout the night, pounding the rebel positions with missile salvos and driving them back from the trapped Dragoons.

One of the most beloved figures in the Imperium, Sanguinius was among both the most noble and mightiest Primarchs. His charisma, humility, and loyalty to the Emperor to the point of self-sacrifice has earned him a great deal of reverence, even in the 41st Millennium. When the Emperor began his Great Crusade to reunite the galaxy he created the Primarchs, superhuman warriors to lead his Space Marines across the galaxy. The powers of Chaos stole the Primarchs, but unable to destroy them, set them astray in the Warp. The infant Sanguinius came to rest upon the radiation-soaked moon of Baal Secundus and was adopted by a tribe of humans known as the 'People of the Pure Blood' or simply 'The Blood'. Sanguinius, like all Primarchs, grew quickly and soon surpassed all his teachers and was capable of mighty feats of strength and endurance. At three weeks, he was a large child capable of walking. Within a year, he was taller than any man. Before even being found by The Blood, Sanguinius slew an infamous predator known as the Baalite Fire Scorpion.

Corvus Corax was separated from the Emperor while still an infant by the four Chaos gods. He was discovered on Lycaeus, the desolate moon of the planet Kiavahr. At this time the planet was a technologically advanced Forge World, providing its city-size factories with minerals extracted from the non-atmospheric moon by legions of mine-slaves.[2b]

Prime Absolvers	The Prime Absolvers are a Dark Angels Successor Chapter of the Ultima Founding. Their Chapter Master, Dagiel Harn, saw no reason for the Prime Absolvers to feel the responsibility borne by many of the Unforgiven Chapters. To Harn the Fallen Angels are no different to other traitors. Though he established an Inner Circle and specialized Companies, he sees his Chapter's mission as hunting all the Emperor's foes equally.

Red Wolves	Let your words be the last thing they hear.— Chaplain Scolasti of the Red Wolves to the 10th Company before the Blooding The Red Wolves are a Space Marine Chapter. Symbol is a red wolf's head on a black background.
Night Reapers	The Night Reapers were once a loyal Space Marine Chapter, before they turned to Heresy.[1a] The beginning of the Night Reapers' downfall began in 981.M41, in what became known as The Constantinus Iconoclasm, when the Chapter was charged with defending the Shrine World Salvation-Gamma from an incoming Chaos invasion. However, once the Night Reapers saw the scope of the Chaos forces closing in on Salvation-Gamma, the Chapter performed an Exterminatus on the Shrine World, in order to grant the population what they considered a merciful end. Once word of the Chapter's actions reached the Ecclesiarchy, it lodged such vociferous objections with the Senatorum Imperialis that the Night Reapers were declared to have committed a gross dereliction of duty and as punishment were cosigned to duty along the outer fringes of the Laanah Rifts. Within a decade of Salvation-Gamma's destruction, the Imperium's communication with the Chapter was almost entirely lost.[1a] In 989.M41, the Night Reapers were conclusively linked to the destruction of Rogue Trader Baron Stross Yuen's fleet and were declared Excommunicate Traitoris. After the declaration, the Minotaurs and Red Templars Chapters were dispatched to track the Night Reapers in the depths of the Laanah Rifts to bring them to the Emperor's justice. The war within the Rifts became known as the Harrowing of the Night Reapers and saw the once loyal Chapter unleash numerous Xeno weapons and technology against the Minotaurs and the Red Templars. Finally after three years, what remained of the Night Reapers were cornered on board a vast pre-human void construct known as the Perun Cross as they attempted to mine some unknown xeno weapon from its core. Before the Night Reapers' pursuers could begin their final assault on the fallen Chapter, a Grey Knights strike force arrived and joined them, in what became known as The Perun Cross Incident.[1a]
Sons of Gideon	The Sons of Gideon were a Renegade Space Marine Chapter. They were once loyal to the Imperium, before turning to heresy and giving into their madness. The Inquisition would later order the Crimson Fists to destroy the Sons of Gideon.
Black Vipers	The Black Vipers are a Salamanders Successor Chapter. The Chapter was among those Salamanders Successor Chapters that were created by Archmagos Dominus Cawl during the Ultima Founding. Cawl did so without informing the Salamanders and when they learned of this, they began making contact with their Successors Chapters. However, the Salamanders accidentally learned of the Black Vipers many years after they discovered the existence of their other Successors. Like they did with the others, the Salamanders sent out one of their Chaplains to teach the Black Vipers of the Promethean Cult. However, their chosen Chaplain, Sur K'gosi, disappeared without a trace before reaching them and the Black Vipers have not learned of the Cult's teachings. As a Chapter, they appear to claim no world for their own, and spurn contact with allies on the rare occasion the Chapter is seen at war. Wherever the Black Vipers has been seen, though, agents of Archmagos Dominus Cawl have never been far away.
Marines Penitent	The Marines Penitent are a Space Marine Chapter. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view.

Lions Azure	The Lions Azure are a Space Marine Chapter. During the Indomitus Crusade, the Torchbearer Fleet Gladius Ad Umbra was dispatched to reinforce the Chapter and give them the ability to create Primaris Space Marines. However the Fleet was unable to locate the Lions Azure, who were thought to be located in the Afqal Sub-sector. They did unexpectedly, though, make contact with the Wardens of the Philae Chapter. After checking their records, Gladius Ad Umbra discovered that the Wardens' history, over the last three millennia, closely resembled the Lions. So much so, that the Fleet's commander could not be certain if the Chapters were one and the same or not.
Espandors	The Espandors are a Space Marine Chapter. Connection to Espandor, if any is unknown.
White Dwarf October 2017	White Dwarf is Games Workshop's premium Warhammer magazine, packed with amazing content each month such as new rules and background, short stories, regular columns, special guests and more.
Templars of Blood	The Templars of Blood are a Space Marine Chapter, descended from the Blood Angels. Like their parent chapter, they pride themselves on their ability to meet the enemy head-on. Known to employ large numbers of flexible Tactical Squads, they do deviate from their predecessor by not organizing any Death Company. Those that succumb to the Black Rage are abandoned, left to fend for themselves in combat. Chaplains of the chapter closely monitor its Battle-Brothers, and if any hint of the rage is detected they are stripped of all their wargear save for a knife and their Power Armour. Should this disgraced warrior survive his next battle, his Captain is honour-bound to cleanly execute him after a prayer is given to Sanguinius and the Emperor. Because of these policies, the number of those who succumb to the Black Rage is lower when compared to other Successor Chapters of the Blood Angels.
Metamarines	The Metamarines are a Space Marine Chapter. This article purports to rely on sources which are not cited in the body of the text.For help on citation see the citation guidelines. You can help Lexicanum by fixing it.
First Founding (Background Book)	First Founding is a background book published by Black Library in 2023 which explores the loyalist First Founding Space Marine Chapters. Following the Age of Strife, with humanity teetering on the brink of annihilation, the Emperor of Mankind unleashed a weapon of unimaginable power. His Space Marines. These mighty warriors, forged in the furnace of war, were marshalled together into the twenty Legions known as the First Founding. In the Era Indomitus, nine of the warrior brotherhoods remain true. Once Legions, now Chapters, they stand defiant as mankind's bulwark against the heretic, the xenos and the daemon. This art and background book explores the iconic loyalist Chapters of the First Founding in depth, bringing to life their distinct identities, cultures, and doctrines of warfare through more than thirty specially commissioned illustrations, including nine phenomenal double-page artworks. Within its pages you'll find detailed lore, background information, and stunning artwork for:
Brazen Claws	Chest eagle displays the company colour The Brazen Claws are a successor Chapter of the Iron Hands and are a Codex Chapter, with the company colour displayed on the chest eagle. The Brazen Claws' homeworld of Talus IV was destroyed by a horde of daemons and the Chapter was forced to flee the planet as it fell to Chaos. They then went on a Crusade against the forces of Chaos into the Eye of Terror to earn vengeance and regain their honor and were rarely seen in the Imperium thereafter. The crusade turned out to be a disaster, with many hundreds of battle brothers dying for little gain. Some Captains abandoned the crusade, seeing little worth in it and wishing to rebuild the Chapter. Others were killed in noble, but ultimately meaningless combat on daemon worlds. Worse still, several companies turned from the Emperor's light and embraced Chaos. Following twenty years of defeat and Pyrrhic victories, Chapter Master Caul Engentre ordered the chapter to return to the Imperium and rebuild. Just as the remaining companies were boarding their ships, an ambush was launched and a dozen warships and two full companies of traitor Brazen Claws jumped in system and attacked. The result of the battle is unclear.
Reparators	The Reparators are a Space Marine Chapter.
Celebrants	The Celebrants are a Space Marine Chapter. Precious little is known about the Celebrants. It is known that they were ordered to withdraw from garrisoning Phaethon IV and directed to remain on the Cardinal World of Nedicta Secundus to protect holy relics from the ravages of Hive Fleet Kraken and its splinter fleets. However, this order turned out to be a ploy orchestrated by an Alpha Legion Traitor Marine claiming to be Alpharius. The Crimson Consuls were stationed on Phaethon IV in the place of the Celebrants as part of the Alpha Legion Traitor Marine's grand plan that resulted in the destruction of the Crimson Consuls Chapter.
Astral Templars	The Astral Templars are a Space Marine Chapter. They were among the various Chapters that took part in the Charadon Campaign. They are known to have been affiliated with the Duralim Court of Defiance.

The book has 50 pages and was second in the original soft cover Imperial Armour series until replaced by the larger, re-numbered hard covered editions. This volume focuses on Eldar, Dark Eldar, and Orks.
Exsanguinators	The Exsanguinators are a Blood Angels Successor Chapter and are known to suffer from the Black Rage at levels similar to the Flesh Tearers Chapter. In M39, the Blood Drinkers believed that the Exsanguinators had been fatally undone by the Black Rage. However, by late M41 the Chapter was still active.
Subjugators	The Subjugators are a Space Marine chapter. They are one of 20 Space Marine chapters known as the Astartes Praeses, which were created to watch over the Eye of Terror region and protect the Eastern Marches from enemy invasions to Terra. The Subjugators are known to be unrelenting in the prosecution of the enemies of Mankind, attacking with overwhelming force and eschewing many of the more subtle arts of war, resulting in the destruction of enemy forces, resources and assets. Their use of extreme methods causes many Imperial Commanders to hesitate requesting for aid, because they will both purge the invading enemies and the oppressed population. They follow a lot of the traditions of the Imperial Fists Chapter, like the veneration of Rogal Dorn, but also share a lot in common with the Black Templars, in their zeal to destroy all potential threats to the Imperium. Their duties in the Segmentum Solar and Obscurus prohibits them from undertaking the crusades like the Black Templars, but they can still contribute small forces to larger operations.
Persecutors of Darkness	This article or article section is based on information from a Fanatic Press publication such as Fanatic Magazine or one of its predecessors (e.g. The Citadel Journal, Necromunda Magazine, etc.). These publications regularly featured articles submitted by hobbyists, and as such, their content may or may not be in contradiction to established background lore. The Persecutors of Darkness are a Space Marine Chapter. Of Dark Angels ancestry, they are part of the Unforgiven.
Blood Swords	The Blood Swords are a Codex Chapter with the notable distinction of one of their Chapter Masters being entombed within a Dreadnought.[1b] The chapter has close ties and a shared history with the Star Dragons Chapter, as their home worlds are near each other. Currently the Blood Swords are serving with Containment Fleet Kappa, near the Eye of Terror, as part of their Chapter’s ongoing penitence crusade.
Brazen Beasts	The Brazen Beasts are a Khornate Chaos Space Marine Warband. In battle the Brazen Beasts deploy hordes of Daemon Engines that lead the Warband's charge, as they tear into their enemies. The Warband's use of Daemon Engines stems from their worship of the Daemons known as the Gorethunder Cohort, which pounds their foes into oblivion with massed batteries of Skull Cannons and rampaging Soul Grinders. In imitation of the Gorethunder, the Brazen Beasts have assembled a mighty stable of Forgefiends, Maulerfiends and Defilers, which they transport deep within the bowels of their Space Hulk, the Oblivion Shadow. There the Daemon Engines' needs are attended to by a coven of Warpsmiths that have been enslaved by the Warband. Chief amongst these infernal engines is a mighty Lord of Skulls, known as the Caged God, which serves as a towering war-idol that is worshiped by the Brazen Beasts. It is the frenzied visions of this abomination that guide the Brazen Beasts through the void, and leads them to fresh victims for the slaughter.[1a] The Brazen Beasts were formed when a garrison of the Golden Blades Chapter were overcome by a strange madness while defending the Fortress of Intolerance against an attack by Daemons on the Imperium world of Ghahalla in M37. The Space Marines began defacing their war machines with horrific symbols, and used blood rituals to subdue their Daemonic assailants and trap them within their tainted vehicles. With this act the first seeds of the Warband, who would soon become the Brazen Beasts were planted.[1b]
Darkspires	The Darkspires are a Space Marine Chapter. Some of the Chapter's forces served in the Indomitus Crusade' Battle Group Kallides and fought the Necrons in the Pariah Nexus. There the Darkspires were part of the forces sent to defend Paradyce II and then end the siege of the Shrine World's city-sized Chancel. However, before the Battlegroup's forces reach the Chanel they were surrounded by the Necron. Despite being outnumbered, the Darkspires were somehow able to carve a path through the Xenos, which completely destroyed the Necron. This, alongside the successful attack led by the Sons of Orar, allowed the Battlegroup's forces to continue their advance. When the Darkspires were later asked how they accomplished this feat, though, they refused to answer.
Crimson Paladins	The Crimson Paladins are a Codex Chapter.
Blood Tigers	The Blood Tigers are a loyalist Space Marine Chapter.
White Templars	The White Templars are a Codex Chapter of Space Marines. The White Templars are stoic and relentless in the prosecution of their foes. For a time they were thought to be Imperial Fists successors, but recent Administratum discoveries have thrown doubt on that claim. The White Templars have been shaken by this revelation, and have launched a Crusade to discover the truth. A world protected by the White Templars under oath is Ystrad. They would uphold this oath for 3,000 years until it was condemned to Exterminatus in M42 while preparing defences against an oncoming Tyranid Hive Fleet invasion.
Sons of Pertinax	The Sons of Pertinax are a 17th Founding Space Marine Chapter, who are thought to be descended from the Imperial Fists. They are a Codex Chapter in every regard, except that traditionally the last aspect of their name is changed to include the name of their current Chapter Master. They are currently led by Pertinax, who succeeded Commodus whose actions caused the Sons to be labelled as a Renegade Chapter in M41. This occurred after Commodus attempted to subjugate an entire world to his will, which drew the attention of the Inquisition. He was later declared a renegade for his actions and Commodus' reign was eventually ended by a Callidus Assassin. His heinous actions, though, tainted the Sons and after Pertinax took command, the Chapter began a Penitent Crusade in order to redeem themselves.

Cruor Blades	The Cruor Blades are a Blood Angels Successor Chapter.[1a] A loyal member of the Sanguinary Brotherhood, the Cruor Blades have been overwhelmed with guilt since their failure to reach Baal before it was devastated at the end of the 41st millennium. Now on a self-imposed crusade of penitence, the Chapter's fleets roam the Red Scar as they take part in the ongoing campaign to purge it of the Tyranids. The Cruor Blades are also determined to restore the light of the Imperium to the Imperium Nihilus and venture forth to spread word of Commander Dante's appointment as Regent of the hellish realm.[1a] The red of their power armor signifies the Cruor Blades acknowledgment of the Chapter's Blood Angels heritage[1b]. The Cruor Blades also favor wielding swords and various types of these weapons are personally created by them[1b][1c]. Some are known to be forged from the gold mined, from their Homeworld, Kremonas', deepest veins[1b]. While most of the Cruor Blades name their weapons, to form attachments to them, the Honor Guard Lybekion is known not to. Amongst the Chapter's Battle Brothers, raising one's blade before them and then lowering it slowly, is a gesture signifying great admiration to another Space Marine.[1c]
Crimson Castellans	The Crimson Castellans are a Space Marine Chapter which turned partially renegade.[1a] Since abandoning their Homeworld, Vorl Secundus[1b], the Crimson Castellans have become a Fleet Based Chapter. The loyal Crimson Castellans were involved in a war on Hive World Sephrax against a pirate warband fronted by their renegade brothers, when Hive Fleet Jormungandr descended upon the planet. Both sides, although there was never an official truce, wisely never sought to jeopardize their own survival by engaging two enemies at once. However, all they could do was slow the Hive Fleet down. Eventually, Sojai Antiro, the Crimson Castellan's Chapter Master, died in the bowels of Hoventa Hive spitting curses at Raveners who tore him limb from limb. The pirates' leader, the self-styled Arch-Commodore Bloodspite, displayed pragmatism too late and fled to his orbiting asteroid lair which was swallowed by a Hive Ship of enormous size.[1a]
Black Templars	The Black Templars are a Second Founding chapter derived from the Imperial Fists. Since its founding, the Black Templars have campaigned on a never-ending crusade. During Horus's attack on the Imperial Palace, the Imperial Fists' primarch, Rogal Dorn chose his First Captain, Sigismund, as the Emperor's Champion; he was given the best armour and weapon and swore a holy duty to challenge the Champions of Chaos, and triumphed over all he met in battle. After the Horus Heresy, Roboute Guilliman, the primarch of the Ultramarines, ordered the breakdown of the Space Marine Legions into chapters. Dorn thought Guilliman a coward for not being there during the defence of Terra. Guilliman, in turn, thought Dorn a rebel for refusing to accept the dictates of the new Codex Astartes. Neither would give in. Leman Russ of the Space Wolves and Vulkan of the Salamanders both sided with Dorn, as they did not want their Legions divided, while Corax of the Raven Guard and Jaghatai Khan of the White Scars sided with Guilliman. Again, civil war threatened to split the Imperium.

Please help to improve this article by fixing those issues as described in the corresponding Help article. Do also note that it is absolutely forbidden to add new information or content to these marked passages as long as the pre-existing citation issues have not been completely resolved. The Salamanders, originally known as the Dragon Warriors, were the XVIII Legion of the 20 Space Marine Legions created by the Emperor of Mankind. Their Primarch was Vulkan. The legion remained loyal during the Horus Heresy, but were severely mauled in the first great opening battle, limiting the role they could play in the remainder of the war. Their primarch is never recorded as perishing, and in fact is believed simply to be missing; the search for him and his presumed great purpose is a defining trait of the Salamanders. Other aspects of the legion of Vulkan are their great hardiness as warriors and their equally strong constitutions, willpower and devotion to humanity. In some ways, they can be considered the ideal of what it means to be a Space Marine.[1a] The Salamanders hail from the harsh and hot Nocturne, though are also based upon that world's moon, Prometheus. The moon occupies an erratic orbit, thus causing great seasons of severe tectonic activity and weather disruption on Nocturne. The worst of these is known as the Time of Trial, when, once every fifteen Terran years, the moon passes so close that thousands of volcanoes erupt, their ash so thick it blots out the sun. With the ground gripped by constant earthquakes at the same time as this ash winter, much of Nocturne becomes effectively uninhabitable.[1a]

The Crimson Fists are a Space Marine Chapter. They are one of the successor Chapters created during the Second Founding, their progenitors being the Imperial Fists and their Primarch Rogal Dorn. After the Horus Heresy, it was decided (in the Codex Astartes written by the Ultramarines Primarch Roboute Guilliman) that no single man should ever wield the power of a whole legion of Space Marines alone, and that each legion was to be split up into thousand-man strong chapters. Rogal Dorn of the Imperial Fists legion long opposed this, but decided to yield rather than risk the fragile peace of the post-heresy Imperium. The Imperial Fists legion was divided into four chapters: The marines most devoted to their Primarch were to remain Imperial Fists, the most zealous started the never-ending crusade of the Black Templars and the younger and more levelheaded marines formed the Crimson Fists. The first Chapter Master of the Crimson Fists was Alexis Polux, a hero of the Heresy. The chapter's name derives from the ceremony conducted at the initiation of new chapter masters in the Imperial Fist legion. The Chapter Master and the Primarch would both cut their palm and share blood in a warrior handshake; strengthening the marine with the blood of the Primarch and forming a symbolic bond between them.
Dark Sons	The Dark Sons are a Codex Chapter of Space Marines founded from the Novamarines. The Dark Sons have the honour of having been tutored by the Novamarines themselves. A certain level of pridefulness and egotism clings to these warriors and has soured their dealings with other Imperial organizations. However, this confidence is not unfounded, as the Dark Sons fight with remarkable efficiency and skill. The Dark Sons wear quartered green-and-white power armour with a gold imperialis. Company affiliation is denoted by the colour of the Marine's right kneepad.
Charnel Guard	The Charnel Guard are a Fleet Based Space Marine Chapter[2a] that are believed to be of Blood Angels descent.[3c] The Chapter is believed to have been created in the Third Founding, due to the large number of ancient war relics, weapons and vehicles in their arsenal which are rarely seen in the 41st Millennium; in the Chapter's possession are at least three Fellblade super-heavy tanks[3b] and a formidable fleet of Fire Raptor gunships. Having been founded by Dominion Zephon, they are also of Blood Angels descent, but they are not acknowledged as such by their Founding Chapter.[3c] Despite this, they were among the Chapters of the Blood that defended the Blood Angels' homeworld of Baal when it was attacked by the tyranids of Hive Fleet Leviathan.[4a] In 587.M41 the Charnel Guard were selected to become part of the newly created Maelstrom Warders. However, in 651.M41 the Chapter was suddenly redeployed by the High Lords of Terra to take part in the Thanatos Crusade into the Veiled Region.[2a]
Imperial Armour Volume Twelve - The Fall of Orpheus	Imperial Armour Volume Twelve - The Fall of Orpheus is an Imperial Armour expansion book by Forge World for Warhammer 40,000. It focuses on the invasion of the Orpheus Sector by the recently awoken Necrons of the tainted Maynarkh Dynasty and the sector-wide Imperial defence mounted by the Minotaurs and the Death Korps of Krieg.[1b] The volume features a new Necron army list, with rules for new Necron units; a new Death Korps of Krieg army list; and updates for the Minotaurs Space Marine Chapter.[1c] This section presents a History of the Orpheus Sector from M30 to 991.M41, the natives Angels Revenant Space Marines Chapter, and the decisive Battle of Amarah.[1d]

Warhammer 40,000 8th Edition Rulebook	Warhammer 40,000 8th Edition Rulebook is the 8th rulebook for Warhammer 40,000 by Games Workshop. It continued the advancement in the timeline seen in the ending stages of the 7th Edition and the introduction of the Primaris Space Marines. The 8th Edition rulebook was succeeded in July 2020 with the release of the Warhammer 40,000 9th Edition Rulebook. After more than forty thousand years of war and strife among the stars, Humanity stands on the brink of extinction. Beset on all sides by hostile aliens and threatened from within by traitors, Humanity’s only chance for survival rests with the continuation of the cruel and bloody regime known as the Imperium. Yet few among Mankind’s untold population realise the full truth of their situation. If there is any future at all, it is a grim one...
Cerulean Guard	The Cerulean Guard are a Space Marine Chapter. During the Thirteenth Black Crusade, the Chapter sent three of its Companies to aid in the defense of Cadia from the Despoiler's invading forces. However, it is not known how many of the Cerulean Guard escaped from the Fortress World, before it was destroyed.
Wolfspear	The Wolfspear are a Space Wolves Successor Chapter. The Wolfspear were created from Space Wolves members of the Unnumbered Sons, 500 marines who survived the Battle of Raukos. That battle concluded the Indomitus Crusade and the Chapter was then charged by Lord Commander Guilliman, with guarding the Pit of Raukos from any future Chaos incursions. This was to the dismay of some members of the Wolfspear, who had hoped to continue fighting on the front-lines against the Imperium's enemies. Further clouding the minds of the Chapter, was that although the Space Wolves had allowed Primaris Space Marines into their ranks, it was not known if they would accept the Wolfspear as true Sons of Russ. Guilliman personally arrived at Fenris at the head of an Indomitus Crusade Fleet to bring the Grey Shields before the Wolves. He proposed that while some would join the Space Wolves proper, others would form their own independent chapter. This brought fierce debate throughout The Fang, for many distrusted these warriors they had never met or fought beside and had never been exposed to the cultures and dangers of Fenris. Gunnar Red Moon was among the most noted opponents of the new arrivals, stating he would rather fight alongside a dozen true Space Wolves than a hundred others who he had never feasted aside. Ultimately Great Wolf Logan Grimnar ended the debate by issuing the Kin-pack Declaration. This was a formal recognition of the Space Wolves successors that stated whether they were forged in the Fang or otherwise all of the lineage of Leman Russ were to be considered his sons. However, he also stated that the new Greyshields must prove themselves in battle or face the scorn of their brothers and that all of the newcomers joining the Space Wolves must uphold the ancient traditions of the Chapter. Thus each Primaris squad became a pack and they took up roles as Blood Claws, Grey Hunters, and so on depending upon their strength and experience.
1st Founding	The twenty Space Marine Legions, also known as the Legiones Astartes, were created by the Emperor to take part in the Great Crusade in what was later known as the First Founding. All the Space Marines of a Legion ("battle-brothers" amongst themselves) were modified with help of the DNA samples of a single Primarch. As a Primarch was found, he would receive the command of his respective Legion. The Legiones Astartes were originally created by the Emperor and his gene-wrights in the closing days of the Unification Wars and the extinction of their predecessors, the Thunder Warriors. The new Astartes had superior lifespans and discipline to those of the Thunder Warriors, and were intended by the Emperor to spearhead his coming Great Crusade.[7a] Each of the twenty Legions were created from gene-seed derived from a single Primarch, which were themselves maturing deep under the Himalayan Mountains before they were stolen away from the Forces of Chaos.[6a] However, while the Gene-Seed was created by the Emperor, it was perfected and mass-produced by the Gene-Cults of Luna after they were pacified by the early Astartes. The combat debut of the Legiones Astartes occurred towards the end of the Unification Wars when they fought rebellious Thunder Warriors in the Palace Coup. During the subsequent Great Crusade, the twenty Legiones Astartes were the tip of the Emperor's spear in his conquest of much of the galaxy. Gradually, the twenty lost Primarchs were reunified with their gene-sons and led them to further glories, where they would begin to establish unique identities for themselves. However, some point during the Great Crusade, two of the legions were erased from all records for unknown reasons.[7b]

Tributors	The Tributors are a Space Marine Chapter.
Hawk Lords	The Hawk Lords are a Codex Chapter of Space Marines. The Hawk Lords eschew Drop Pods in favour of Thunderhawk Gunships for low-altitude insertion. They are the undisputed masters of such tactics and it is not unknown for Thunderhawk pilots of other chapters to hone their skills on temporary service as part of a Hawk Lords Talon Wing.[1a] The Hawk Lords also often use their Stormtalon Gunships as attack units, fielding entire squadrons of these manoeuvrable and fast aircraft to strike enemy positions deep behind the main front lines. The Hawk Lords are also responsible for the creation of Hawk Wings, masterfully-crafted jump packs capable of bearing even a Devastator Marine into battle without costing him the use of his heavier armament.
Dictators	The Dictators are a Space Marine Chapter.
Red Scorpions	The Red Scorpions are a Space Marine Chapter of unknown origin.[1a] The origins of the Red Scorpions Chapter are unknown. No records remain of the chapter's founding or from which Space Marine Legion their geneseed was first taken. This secrecy has led to some of the Imperium's hierarchy questioning the loyalty of a chapter that keeps its history secret and holds itself answerable to the Emperor alone. Despite this, the chapter assists wherever it can, carrying out thousands of relief missions. It is known, however, that the chapter has existed for at least 5,000 years.[1a] More recently, they have been involved in operations against Hive Fleet Kraken and the growing Ork empire of Urgok the Unstoppable[1a] as well as the Octarius War.
Emperor's Warbringers	The Emperor's Warbringers are a Codex Space Marine Chapter. The Chapter is known to camouflage their vehicles. The Warbringers are unusually deliberate and circuitous for a Space Marine Chapter. Where other chapters often arrive on a battlezone with drop pod assaults and other fanfare, the Warbringers believe in preparing their ground first, for weeks or months if necessary. They make extensive use of scout squads to reconnoiter enemy territory and identify key targets, while ensuring that the enemy remains unaware of their presence. Only when the moment is right, and all elements are in place, do the Warbringers strike, with every tool in the Space Marine Armoury, aiming for a single, decisive action that will end the conflict.
Celestial Swords	The Celestial Swords were two Space Marine Chapters that were Founded at the same time and were mistakenly given the same name and heraldries by the Administratum. Two centuries later, both Chapters were destroyed by Abaddon's forces during the Ninth Black Crusade and it was only after the Celestial Swords' bodies were recovered from the Cicerine System that the Administratum realized their mistake.

The Doom Eagles Chapter are a Second Founding Chapter of the Ultramarines. Based on the planet Gathis II, they are a notoriously pious, grim and aloof chapter. All of creation suffers, young ones. Only in accepting our own mortality can we make a difference. Only in bearing the burden of our failures can we find the strength to go on. Only in detachment from glory, or honour, or jealousy... from life itself can we hope to spare others from grief.

The Ultramarines, originally known as the War-Born,[38d] were the XIII Legion of the original twenty Space Marine Legions. This loyalist Legion was later re-organized and divided into Chapters according to the Codex Astartes. Their Primarch is Roboute Guilliman, whose leadership, not to mention his authorship of the Codex Astartes, were instrumental in humanity's survival following the Horus Heresy. Because their Primarch wrote the text that defines a Space Marine Chapter, the Ultramarines follow this Codex strictly; their only deviation being the recent formation of the Tyrannic War Veterans, comprised entirely of veterans of battles with the Tyranids. The Ultramarines are possibly the most important Imperial organization on the Eastern Fringe. The Ultramarines, in the days before being reunited with their Primarch, were originally known as XIII Legion. The legion was created towards the end of the Unification Wars, developed from a gene-seed that was noted to be absent of mutation and with a high adaptability. The original recruits were drawn from from the sub-equatorial maglev clans of Panpocro, the war families of the Saragon Enclave, the Midafrik Hive Oligarchy and the anthropophagic tribes of the Caucasus Wastes. As varied in culture and origin as these groups were, they all had one factor in common; their violent and often bitter resistance to the later stages of Unification, a resistance broken ultimately in each case not by negotiated surrender but near annihilation, with in some situations little remaining save interned refugees and orphaned populations left by the savage conflicts which had brought these peoples to heel. The legion was created at such a late stage in the war that they have no recorded combat operations on Terra, instead being used for the first time for the liberation of the Solar System.[38c] During the Early Great Crusade, the Legion became known as the War-Born, referring to their disparate Terran origins that were all nonetheless forged through war.[38d]
Execrators	The Execrators are a Space Marine Chapter.
Dragon Lords	The Dragon Lords are a Codex Chapter of the Space Marines. Even before the cataclysm of the opening of the Great Rift, contact with the Dragon Lords had been lost. It was after the costly efforts of a Torchbearer task force did they find that the Dragon Lords still survived, having nearly been annihilated by successive Hrud invasions that saw their Fortress-Monastery completely destroyed. Reinforced with Primaris brethren, they now have the strength to fight offensively in Imperium Nihilus.

Crimson Shades	The Crimson Shades are a Space Marine Chapter. The Librarians of the Crimson Shades are a notable exception to those prescribed in the Codex Astartes. Precisely how the Librarium functions is unknown, though the atypical nature of its operation is comparable to that of the Rune Priests of the Space Wolves, the Stormseers of the White Scars, and the Librarians of the Novamarines.
Astral Knights	The Astral Knights were a Space Marine Chapter from an unknown founding and were descended from the Imperial Fists. The Chapter was destroyed in battle with the Necron World Engine in 926.M41.[1b] The Astral Knights sacrificed their chapter to destroy the World Engine. This Necron weapon was a planet-sized spaceship, armed with gauss projectors capable of scouring planets of all life.[1a] The World Engine was attacked by a task force composed of elements from fifteen Space Marine chapters, plus elements from the Imperial Navy. Even the starships' mightiest weapons could not harm it. Drop pods and torpedoes could not penetrate its void shields and it was impossible to lock on to it with teleport beams. The Imperial task force tried twelve times to overwhelm it through sheer valour and firepower and was rewarded with a string of destroyed and crippled ships and millions of casualties. The World Engine destroyed a third of an Imperial Navy Battlefleet before Artor Amhrad, the Chapter Master of the Astral Knights, decided to ram the World Engine with his Battle barge, Tempestus[1a]. Engines at full power, the Battle Barge collided with the World Engine's shields, and broke through. Only once they were inside the shields did the Space Marines have a chance. The entire Astral Knights chapter deployed from Drop Pods onto the artificial world's surface. For one hundred hours, seven hundred seventy-two Astral Knights fought against tens of thousands of Necrons, destroying every flux generator, weapon forge and command node they came upon. But each victory came at a price. Only Amhrad and five battle brothers were left to launch the final assault. Fighting with the fury that legends are made from, the surviving Astral Knights made their way to the deepest part of the World Engine that housed many command nodes. In a final act of heroism, Amhrad detonated melta-charges that brought down the World Engine's shields and silenced most of its weaponry. The Astral Knights were gone.[1a]
Death Hawks	The Death Hawks are a Space Marine Chapter. A detachment of the Death Hawks were part of a strike force, along with the Space Wolves, stationed above the planet Parenxes. The strike force was later caught in a surprise attack by the Red Corsairs and destroyed. For unknown reasons, in other source (where events are described in more detail) this Chapter is first mentioned as the Flame Hawks, and then as the Death Hawks. However, judging by the general description of events, it is one and the same Chapter.
Crimson Blades	The Crimson Blades are a Blood Angels Successor Chapter. The Flesh Tearer Thuriel is a critic of the Chapter and says the Crimson Blades have lowered themselves to superstition and mysticism, like the Flesh Eaters and Mortifactors. He also says these Chapters' once-noble traditions have been infected by the fallacies of their Homeworld and that they are now savages who do not deserve their status.

The Unnamed	The Unnamed are a Dark Angels Successor Chapter of the Ultima Founding. When the senior elements of The Unnamed learned of the Dark Angels' secrets, from Supreme Grand Master Azrael, they felt the weight of their genetic ancestors' guilt heavily on their shoulders. Because of this, The Unnamed refused to take a name for their Chapter, deeming themselves unworthy of doing so, and refused to take a Homeworld. Instead the Fleet Based Chapter became determined that they would never cease to ply the stars, until the blight of the Fallen Angels was eradicated from the galaxy forever.
Emerald Snakes	The Emerald Snakes were a Fleet Based Space Marine Chapter.[1a] Their nomadic fleets operated across the galactic north-west and the Halo Stars, until the creation of the Great Rift. The giant Warpstorm cut the Emerald Snakes off from the light of the Astronomican and without it, their ships were cast adrift.[1a] The Chapter's fleets were then attacked by Daemons[1b], who ultimately destroyed the Emerald Snakes.[1a]
Knights of Byzantium	The Knights of Byzantium are an Iron Hands Successor Chapter. The Chapter was created during the Ultima Founding and the left hand of their power armor is bronze, to signify their Iron Hands lineage. In battle, the Knights of Byzantium prioritize efficiency and do so by destroying their enemies at range, with as much firepower as possible. After their creation, the Chapter was charged with both protecting their new Homeworld, Byzantium, and with ensuring the libration of those worlds around it, from the forces of Chaos. The Knights of Byzantium have since sent out several reclamation strike forces to fulfill their oaths.

Revilers	The Revilers are a Successor Chapter of the Raven Guard, created during the Second Founding in M31. The Revilers are one of the few Chapters to have been sired by the Raven Guard during the Second Founding and their ranks were drawn heavily from the Legion's veteran survivors of the Drop Site Massacre. Because of this, they have pursued a fierce vengeance against the Chaos Space Marines who betrayed the Raven Guard on that fateful day.[8a] The Chapter's warriors have since proven worthy inheritors of Corax's legacy and possess exceptional skills in stealth warfare and ambush tactics. They have used these skills in their ongoing Shadow War with the traitor forces of the Alpha Legion, and have thwarted many of their insidious schemes. The most recent conflict was in the Haedrax System, where the Revilers destroyed the Alpha Legion's cells within the System.[8a]
Emperor's Swords (Ghorstangrad)	The Emperor's Swords were a Space Marines Chapter which were destroyed. A second Chapter of the same name would later suffer a similar terrible fate. The Emperor's Swords were destroyed through the machinations of the Alpha Legion. For over a dozen generations the Alpha Legion manipulated the slums, gangs, and sects of Ghorstangrad, the Emperor's Swords' homeworld. The Alpha Legion placed subconscious triggers in the rituals used by the gangs and sects. It was from these gangs and sects that the Emperor's Swords recruited new Space Marines. When the Alpha Legion attacked Ghorstangrad, they were able to use these triggers to disorient and confuse a good number of the Emperor's Swords. Some even turned against their battle-brothers. In the ensuing chaos, the Emperor's Swords were overrun. The gene-seed of the fallen was harvested and stolen by the Alpha Legion, and some of the surviving traitors joined the Alpha Legion. The Chapter's former homeworld of Ghorstangrad now serves as a stronghold for Chaos Space Marines.
Void Reapers	The Void Reapers are a Space Marine Chapter. They are considered as a lesser-known chapter.
Desolators	The Desolators are a Space Marine Chapter.
Defenders Obscurus	The Defenders Obscurus are an Imperial Fists Successor Chapter. In M42, the Chapter's Homeworld was invaded by overwhelming number of Hive Fleet Ouroboris Bio-ships. A plea for aid was sent out, which was answered by the Imperial Fists, who rushed to aid a fellow Chapter born of their Primarch Dorn. However by the time their fleet arrived, the Defenders Obscurus had been nearly destroyed. The Chapter's fleet was nothing but debris and their Homeworld was swarming with Tyranids. The Defenders' Fortress Monastery was also ablaze, but the Imperial Fists refused to abandon their Successor Chapter. Their fleet was outnumbered ten to one, though, and soon began losing warships to the Hive Fleet. The fighting would then drag on for hours, but the Imperial Fists found themselves no closer to saving the Defenders. This changed, when a Torchbearer Fleet suddenly appeared. The Torchbearers had been tasked with giving the Defenders, the Primaris technology and they immediately struck the Obscurus Fleet. With the element of surprise on their side, the Torchbearer Fleet was able to punch through the Bio-ships and reach the Defenders' Homeworld. Once there, they delivered reinforcements to the Chapter's Fortress Monastery, before attacking the Hive Fleet again. Forces of the Adeptus Custodes, Sisters of Silence and Greyshields, were then able to cleanse the Fortress and save what remained of the Chapter. Afterwards, the Hive Fleet was destroyed and the Defenders Obscurus were able to begin rebuilding their strength and numbers.

Iron Lords	The Iron Lords are a Codex Chapter of Iron Hands descent. The Iron Lords are known for their exceptionally stern demeanour and xenophobia. Ever since M38, it has been their duty to maintain the blockade of the Grendl Stars, confining the vile Barghesi within until the Imperium can muster enough resources to annihilate them. In recent years, they have battled the tendrils of Hive Fleet Kraken as it sweeps through the Grendl Stars, leading the Iron Lords to engage in one desperate battle after another with ever greater swarms of bio-engineered horrors. Should Kraken be allowed to assimilate the potential of the Barghesi, the results would be dire. The Iron Lords operate fourteen fortresses within the Grendl Stars to hold back the Xenos. Since the formation of Imperium Nihilus the Iron Lords have become cut off from aid and are struggling to hold back the Barghesi.
Death Knights	The Death Knights are a Codex Chapter of the Space Marines.
Dragonspears	The Dragonspears are a Salamanders Successor Chapter. The Chapter was among those Salamanders Successor Chapters that were created by Archmagos Dominus Cawl, during the Ultima Founding. Cawl did so without informing the Salamanders and when they learned of this, they began making contact with their Successors Chapters. However since the Dragonspears are a Fleet Based Chapter, it took many years for the Salamanders to make contact with them. By then, the Dragonspears had won renown for fighting alongside the Space Wolves against the Orks at the Gnarion Reef. The experience had led them to become expert Ork hunters, and they had also developed a very strong culture of self-sacrifice and endocannibalism. This was done to ensure that the Dragonspears' lost Battle Brothers, never fell from their memories. During the Psychic Awakening, the Chapter was among the Imperial forces that took part in The Chancyll Suppression. The Dragonspears later upheld old oaths of brotherhood towards the Space Wolves and joined their efforts to stop the Great Waaagh!.
Swords of Guilliman	The Swords of Guilliman are an Ultramarines Successor Chapter. They specialize in surgical strikes, but these often result in major collateral damage and high casualty rates. To ensure they avoid friction with the wider Imperium, however, the Swords of Guilliman choose to fight in only the most desperate of war zones.

Spectral Tigers	The Spectral Tiger are a Space Marine Chapter. In 6264845.M34, they cleansed Thakarta 3 of the Chaos Cultists that had infested the Imperial world.
Crimson Knights	The Crimson Knights are a Blood Angels Successor Chapter known for their swiftly-moving assault forces and fierce assaults. The Crimson Knights were Founded in M35 in order to defend a region of the Imperium against the predations of the Eldar. This has led them to fight a series of battles against Craftworld Kaelor and the Chapter's 3rd Company Captain is regarded as a hero for leading a successful raid against a Craftworld. This has earned the Captain and the Crimson Knights the enmity of the Eldar, and the Chapter is currently rebuilding their strength after suffering severe losses in battle. In one such incident, the Chapter's forces were saved due to the timely intervention of an Imperial Navy Battlefleet and the Crimson Knights now count the Navy as one of their closest allies. The Chapter's homeworld is the distant world Tembron, where the Crimson Knights' leaders are its ultimate authority.

Twilight Swords (Chapter)	The Twilight Swords are a Space Marine Chapter. Founded on the storm world of Gladius IV, the Twilight Swords Chapter reveres skill at arms above all else. A series of ritual duels determines how high its members can rise in rank, although defeat rarely results in death. Instead, a Twilight Sword who loses a challenge is inspired to train harder and learn new skills for their next attempt. Although this commitment to excellence is admirable, the Twilight Swords' pride is ever a source of concern; as they constantly struggle to avoid having a tactically sound battle plan, devolve into a series of one-to-one duels during combat. The Twilight Swords' Commanders and Chaplains lead by example and exact harsh discipline to rein in the duellist tendencies of their brethren.

Ferrus Manus	"If fighting is all there is, if we may never pause to reflect on what such devotion to strength is doing to us, then our compulsion will only grow. Already I see the madness that path leads to, and so I shall excise the silver from my hands. In doing so I shall weaken myself and my sons, but nonetheless it must be done. The hands are strong, and have created great things, but they are not mine." Ferrus Manus, (literally "Hand of Iron") the Gorgon, was one of the twenty Primarchs created by the Emperor before the Great Crusade. He led the Iron Hands Space Marine Legion. During his time on the world of Medusa, Ferrus Manus possessed hands encased in necrodermis, granting him the ability to manipulate molten metal with exceptional strength and artistry, eschewing the need for traditional tools like hammers and flames. Ferrus was stolen away by the forces of Chaos, just as his brothers were, and spent his first years on the planet Medusa. As a youth, he discovered an "X" mark on the pod that first brought him to this world and that the chamber was too precise to be a natural formation. Exploring further, he discovered runes and electro-conductive stalagmites all around the chamber. His inspections awakened an imprisoned colossal bio-mechanical worm-like creature, which attacked him and escaped, ignoring his attacks. He followed its path of destruction and swore he would destroy the beast he had unwittingly released. When he reached the surface, he saw other men in the distance but wouldn't reveal himself to them, instead keeping his recent oath in mind. Over time, Ferrus had gained a significant legend to the Clans of Medusa. The storm giants of the Karaashi Pinacle called him The Cataclysm. Due to his unleashing of the wyrm, he was also known as the Hunter. The phantasmagoria dubbed him The Finality. The mecharachnis and phasewraiths that sought him out had seemed to classify him as the Rehew Netjer or Son of Man. Meanwhile, the Subliminat had called him Flesh.
Fire Lords	The Fire Lords are a Codex Chapter of Space Marines.[1a] The Fire Lords precede assaults with a barrage of incendiary missiles, and hurl themselves at the charred foe before the flames have burnt themselves out.[1a] The Fire Lords' favoured tactic is launching a planetary assault, which begins with incendiary bombardments, and should the defender survive, they only do so to face close-range bombardment and promethium, usually delivered by Thunderfire Cannons and Land Raider Redeemers. Then, Tactical Squads will deploy in Drop Pods to bring death to the enemies of the Imperium.
Dark Templars	The Dark Templars are a Space Marine Chapter. They guard the contested borders of the Imperium. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here. The Dark Templars was created by Asger Granerud, a former Games Workshop employee. It was featured as an example Chapter for the Northern Europe White Dwarf's Chapter Master Competition and was featured in White Dwarf 298 (UK).

Wrath & Glory Core Rulebook	The Wrath & Glory Core Rulebook (or Wrath & Glory Core Rules) was published in August 2018 and contains the core rules for the Wrath & Glory Warhammer 40,000 Role-Playing Game system. During the production of this book, the following persons were involved considerably.
It Bleeds (Short Story)	As battle nears, a Khornate berzerker prepares for the fight of his life. After the brutal mutilation of his mind by the Butcher's Nails, however, this ancient warrior struggles to remember who he is fighting – or even why.
Iron Shades	The Iron Shades are a Space Marine Chapter. They recruit aspirants from the death world Shoba[3a] and some members of the chapter wear honour tattoos.[3a] The philosophy of the Iron Shades holds that perfection is achieved through contest.[3a] Hailing from a perpetual world of darkness and preferring to work in the shadows with little fanfare, they are nonetheless unusually amicable towards average Imperial citizenry. The chapter's Fifth Battle-Company are void-war specialists.[3a]
Nova Legion	The Nova Legion were an Ultramarines Successor Chapter.[1a] Like their fellow brother Successor Chapters in the Crimson Consuls, Marines Mordant and Vindicators, the Nova Legion were charged with guarding the rimward frontiers of the Maelstrom Warpstorm[1a]. However in late M41, all four were destroyed in sudden systematic attacks on their Homeworlds, by the forces of the Alpha Legion Arch-Lord Quetzel Carthach.[1b] The Chapter's only known survivor is the Devastator Marine Autolicon Phex, who was in a penitoria-cell when Carthach's forces attacked his Homeworld Scintil-Novax and could do nothing to come to its aid. When the Devastator was later found by the Arch-Lord's forces he was given to Carthach, who then brutally tortured Phex and even cut out his tongue.[1b]
Penumbral Talons	The Penumbral Talons are a Raven Guard Successor Chapter. They often have little humanity left in them and the Penumbral Talons have a cold, focused attitude towards their missions. This can give them a sinister aspect, which the Chapter's black and white power armor is meant to lean into. The Penumbral Talons' bolters and helmets are pure white though, in order to highlight that the Chapter's weapons and minds are their most important weapons. The Chapter's talon symbol is designed to link them to the Raven Guard and like their Founding Chapter, the Penumbral Talons are masters of armored ambushes. They will use small forces to lure their enemies into traps, before the Chapter will attack with meticulously organized formations of tanks, gunships and infantry aboard armored transports. The Penumbral Talons also seize captives and mercilessly interrogate them in order to gain intelligence. The Chapter then uses this knowlege to plan further ambushes with.
Storm Hawks	The Storm Hawks are a Codex Chapter. Allegedly of Raven Guard descent, their exact founding date is unknown. The Storm Hawks' colours are primarily white with red; white power-armour with red trim on the shoulder plates and a red aquila on the chest. Company affiliation is shown by the colour of the left knee. Squad number is shown with roman numerals on the right pauldron, or for Terminators the squad number is displayed in the lower right corner of their right pauldron. The Chapter's symbol is a red hawk's head with a lightning bolt shooting out of its mouth.
Panthers	The Panthers are a Space Marine Chapter.
Penitents	The Penitents are a Space Marine Chapter.
Dragons Ardent	The Dragons Ardent are a Blood Angels Successor Chapter. Their Homeworld was the sparsely populated and harsh Ocean World Nautilos, which contained a few islands. Besides a small scattering of settlements, the islands also held the facilities of the Dragons Ardent which included their Fortress Monastery, the Praecipitium. They lived by a philosophy, inherited from the Blood Angels, known as the Angel's Graces, whose uppermost ethics were mercy, restraint and forgiveness. The Dragons Ardent also followed the calming mantras of the Solus Encarmine and upon leaving the Tenth Company, it was a tradition for them to carve a verse of the Moripatris across their foreheads. It would be deep enough to permanently scar the bone and the verse would reflect whatever wisdom they had learned in their time with the Tenth Company. The Chapter also had the traditions of eating the flesh of their dead and claiming the heads of their slain Battle Brothers. There were some within the Imperium that looked askance at such practices and whispered it spoke of the Chapter's Gene-seed degrading or worse. However the Dragons Ardent served faithfully and the skulls of their dead were taken as keepsakes and trophies by the living. These were then turned into objects of beauty by the Chapter's Battle Brothers, who etched, carved and engraved the skulls. However the verses of the Moripatris would still be visibly displayed, as the dead's final message to their Chapter.
Disciples of Caliban	The Disciples of Caliban are a Successor Chapter of the Dark Angels, created in the late 37th millennium. The founding of the Disciples of Caliban is shrouded not only in mystery but also controversy. It is believed that Dark Angels Chapter Master Anaziel made a strong request of the High Lords of Terra for a Chapter to be raised late in the 37th Millennium. At the time, such a request was unheard of from a Chapter Master and no clear reason was given by the Dark Angels. Eventually their request was granted and the Disciples of Caliban were created. The gene-seed used to found the Chapter was of the highest pedigree held by the Dark Angels at the time, and was examined using standards far beyond even those required by the Adeptus Terra. To this day the purity of the Chapter's gene-seed is constantly monitored for the slightest sign of corruption or degradation, and it has the most exacting standards of recruitment of any of the Unforgiven. It is generally acknowledged that Anaziel had the Disciples of Caliban created for a very specific and secretive purpose - rumoured amongst the other Unforgiven to be the pursuit and capture of the renegade known as Cypher, though none outside this Chapter's Inner Circle know if this really is their true purpose. The Disciples of Caliban are a very mobile Chapter, and their fortress fleet has been sighted in conflicts the length and breadth of the Imperium, and sometimes far beyond. Speculation exists that many of these conflicts were instigated or fuelled by the presence of Cypher, and the Disciples have become experts at detecting even the most subtle tell-tale signs of the Fallen. The warriors of the Disciples of Caliban are virtuous and noble to the highest degree, utterly unflinching in their sacred duties. The Chapter fleet houses great reliquaries celebrating the successes of their warriors and their forebears, and each Company has several Relic Bearers who carry these artefacts to war to inspire the battle brethren to the greatest feats of valour. The most sacred of these relics is the Lionus Censum, an immense scroll that details the names and deeds of the Chapter's most decorated Battle Brothers.
Sons of the Raven	The Sons of the Raven were a Fleet Based Space Marine Chapter, until they were destroyed by the forces of Chaos. In 416.M37 the Sons of the Raven joined the strike force of the Inquisitor Lord Antonius Coil, for its mission to destroy the Dark Mechanicum Forge World Sarum. However, when Antonius' strike force neared Sarum it was ambushed by the Warbands of the Warp Ghosts and Black Wings, as well as the Daemon Engines of their Dark Mechanicum allies on Sarum. In the seventeen hour void war that followed, the Sons of the Ravens were unable to escape and were completely destroyed. Once word of their destruction reached Terra, the Sons of the Raven were declared martyers and the Bell of Lost Souls tolled to mourn their passing.
Blades of Vengeance	The Blades of Vengeance are a Dark Angels Successor Chapter. The Blades of Vengeance were the first of the Primaris Space Marine Chapters created, from the Gene-seed of Lion El'Jonson and served with distinction in the Indomitus Crusade. In battle, they are known to exhibit not only the tenacious defence for which their Primarch was famed, but also show a talent for following up with brilliantly executed counter-attacks. They are known for their eagerness in liberating new worlds, though unknown to but a few this is out of a desire to root out The Fallen.

Golden Blades	The Golden Blades are a Space Marine Chapter. In M37, a garrison of the Golden Blades were overcome by a strange madness while defending the Fortress of Intolerance against an attack by Daemons on the Imperium world of Ghahalla. The Space Marines began defacing their war machines with horrific symbols, and used blood rituals to subdue their Daemonic assailants and trap them within their tainted vehicles. With this act the first seeds of the Warband, who would soon become the Brazen Beasts were planted.

Rift Stalkers	The Rift Stalkers are a Raven Guard Successor Chapter. The Rift Stalkers were among the Chapters created during the Ultima Founding at the direct order of Roboute Guilliman. Consisting entirely of Martian Primaris, this Chapter was founded at the start of the Indomitus Crusade rather than being created from the Greyshields.[6a] A Fleet Based Chapter, the Rift Stalkers are tasked to patrol the Great Rift. They diligently seek a method of reconnecting with hundreds of thousands of worlds cut off to the Galactic north.
Raven Covenant	The Raven Covenant are a Space Marine Chapter.
Carcharodons	The Carcharodons (also known as Space Sharks or Carcharodon Astra) are a loyalist Space Marine Chapter with a reputation for ruthlessness and brutality. The Chapter named Carcharodon Astra — translated into Low Gothic as the Space Sharks, but known more widely as the Carcharodons — is a Space Marine Chapter of unknown provenance that has relatively recently carved for itself a dark and brutal legend in the bloody wake of the Badab War. Much of the information surrounding its history is shrouded in myth or allegory, but fragmented pieces of data point to it already being in existence as early as late M32, during the Astropath Wars. The Chapter's ancient history speaks of a "Day of Exile", a time when the Wandering Ancestors had been banished from their home world and ordered out beyond the Galaxy's edge at the behest of an individual known as the "Forgotten One".[7a] One thing is for certain, however: that the Chapter was given a sacred duty to travel the empty spaces beyond the Imperium's borders, seemingly forever, to seek out and destroy the enemies of Mankind.[3d] Today the Carcharodons hold the mysterious Forgotten One and his sire known as the Void Father in great reverence.[7c] Despite the Carcharodons' ignorance on the matter, much information suggests that the Chapter is at least partially descended from Raven Guard elements[3f] that were exiled during the Great Crusade. For instance, the Chapter uses ancient Raven Guard titles. Its Chapter Master is called the Shade Lord, a title only known to have been used by exiled Raven Guard Commander Arkhas Fal during the Great Crusade.[7a] In addition, Carcharodons' Chief Librarian is called the Pale Nomad, a name used by the Raven Guard's 11th Chapter which was partially exiled during the Great Crusade and Horus Heresy. The 11th Chapter also used tactics which resembled those later employed by the Carcharodons. In addition, the Chapter is related to the Renegade Ashen Claws which are descended from Raven Guards who abandoned the Imperium before the Horus Heresy. However, the Ashen Claws do not consider the Carcharodons full relatives, instead regarding them as "mongrel[s]", "traitor-born", "monster[s]" and calling a captured World Eater a "brother" of the Carcharodons. This suggests that the Carcharodons might be of mixed origin or even chimeric.[8f]
Sons of Jaghatai	The Sons of Jaghatai are a Space Marine Chapter. Their symbol is a crescent shape with a small alpha symbol.
Emperor's Havoc	The Emperor's Havoc are an Imperial Fists Successor Chapter. The Emperor's Havoc are pragmatic, no-nonsense urban-warfare specialists, who do not care for glory - only getting the job done. The Chapter's Power Armour is colored in grey and red, but done in shades that make them excellent complementary camouflage. The Emperor's Havoc were created by Andrew Palies, a Games Workshop employee, and the Chapter was showcased in the January 2020 issue of White Dwarf.
Silver Phoenixes	The Silver Phoenixes are a Space Marine Chapter. During the Indomitus Crusade, they were reinforced and given the ability to create Primaris Space Marines by a Torchbearers Fleet. Notably, the Torchbearers' commander was gifted the relic Orb of Cleansing, in order to aid the Fleet in reaching the Silver Phoenixes.
Red Talons	The Red Talons are a Second Founding Successor Chapter of the Iron Hands Legion, created at the end of the Great Scouring. From their inception, they have been defined by a never-ending vendetta against the Traitor Legions that betrayed the Emperor. The history of the Red Talons actually predates the Second Founding itself. The founder and first Chapter Master of the Red Talons was Autek Mor a ruthless Terran-born captain of the Iron Hands, considered an outcast even among his own Legion and could not fully integrate with his brethren. His command, Clan Morragul, became a refuge for other Legionaries who were similarly "ill-balanced." This establishes the precedent for the Red Talons being formed from warriors of a particularly grim, aggressive, and independent mindset. The Red Talons' never-ending vendetta against traitors is a direct continuation of the independent war Autek Mor waged after the death of his Primarch, Ferrus Manus. He operated beyond the sight of Terra, becoming a "byword for destruction" behind enemy lines. This explains the chapter's singular focus and relish for hunting down renegades, as it was their original, self-appointed reason for existing. After the Heresy, Clan Morragul was allowed to retain its independence as a new Chapter, named after Autek Mor's personal flagship during the Horus Heresy, the battle barge Red Talon and adopting Mor's clan sigil—a red talon on a black field—as their new heraldry.
Adamantine Lions	The Adamantine Lions are a Space Marine Chapter. They served in the Indomitus Crusade Fleet Primus as part of Battle Group Kallides' Task Force XI, during the Argovon Campaign.
Dark Swords	The Dark Swords are a Space Marine Chapter. In 649.M40 they aided Inquisitor Malphas Kroh in defending the Imperium world of Garanhir, from an attack by the World Eater Dhalahk and his warband.

Nemesis	The Nemesis Space Marine Chapter are a Second Founding chapter descended from the Ultramarines. They are not found in the Apocrypha of Davio. During the Great Crusade and Horus Heresy, the 22nd Chapter of the Ultramarines Legion was known as the Nemesis Chapter, specialising in Exterminatus operations.[4c] The 22nd was a patchwork of specialised units, most notably maintaining two full companies of the Destroyer squads rarely found in the other Chapters, and had a large Terran contingent - this resulted in a culture which Guilliman considered too far removed from the rest of the Legion.[5b] The Chapter earned their name during the purgation of abhuman corsairs in the Cancerai Nebula alongside the VIII Legion. As well as the name "Nemesis", they took to wearing black gauntlets, midnight blue helms and adopted the weighing scales and death's head icon of judgement.[4c]
Jaghatai Khan	"We remained true. They can never have this, not if they burn all we ever built and scorn us through the dancing flames. You hear me? We remained true"[6a] Jaghatai Khan, known as The Great Khan or The Warhawk, was the primarch of the White Scars Space Marine Legion. Known for his secluded and fierce nature, the Khan was commonly overlooked and seen as a barbarian but in truth was a highly cultured individual.[4x] Most of the records about him are from the White Scars, and as such can be subject to variety and unreliability. The Chaos emissary to Lorgar called him the Warrior. It is said that Khan landed on a planet in the Segmentum Pacificus named (by the Imperium), Mundus Planus, or as the native population called it, Chogoris. It is a fertile world with wide, open, green plains and tall white mountains and blue seas. At the time of the Great Crusade, the people had developed to a black powder stage. A census shows that the dominant empire was a well organised aristocracy which had conquered most of the planet with well equipped and highly disciplined armies, maintaining armoured horsemen and tight blocks of infantry. Their leader was the Palatine, and he won all of his battles with his great army.
Storm Wardens	The Storm Wardens are a Space Marine Chapter of an unknown Founding, famed for their tribal nature and heavy assaults.[1a] In 945.M36, Chapter Master Owin Glendwyr took his forces to the Steropes Cluster in response to a reading of the Emperor's Tarot by the Chief Librarian, although some versions of the account state that it may have been at the behest of the Inquisition. The region of space had many worlds consumed by the energies of the Warp. Several worlds in the periphery had come under the dominion of Enslavers. Glendwyr had a painful choice: deploy his warriors in costly battles or destroy the worlds and their populations. In one account, Glendwyr and an unnamed Inquisitor Lord of the Ordo Xenos explored a series of ruins of uncertain origin. The Storm Wardens and an allied Inquisitorial force came under attack by Enslaver-controlled humans and later by Enslaver Behemoths. The ensuing battle cost the lives of many battle-brothers. Three worlds were cleansed of the xenos presence, but ultimately the Inquisitor Lord declared the Writ of Exterminatus on seven more before the cluster was declared purged.[1a][2b] The Storm Wardens returned to Sacris, where it was discovered that a psychic taint from the Enslavers had corrupted a number of the First Company. The Chapter's Apothecaries, Chaplains, and Librarians attempted to remove the taint, but it was found to be too ingrained and presented a threat to the entire Chapter. The Inquisitor Lord wanted the infected to volunteer for liquidation, but the senior officers rejected it. Glendwyr proposed a compromise. Having convinced the Inquisitor Lord of its viability, the Chapter Master ordered that he and the First Company be interred within stasis sarcophagi in vaults far below the Chapter's fortress-monastery, which would not be opened until a cure for the taint was discovered. The Inquisition placed an additional demand of requiring that Sacris be isolated and all knowledge of the Nemesis Incident be purged from the Imperium's history. Deceptive propaganda of a virulent plague on the planet's surface was spread by automated beacons in orbit for years to come.[1a][2b][2c]
Carmine Blades	The Carmine Blades are a Blood Angels Successor Chapter. Originally known as the Swords of Haldroth after their feral recruiting world, the Chapter originally believed themselves to be descended from the Ultramarines for a considerable amount of time, until a chance meeting with Astorath the Grim in late M41 revealed the truth behind their origins. With the discovery of their true Founding Chapter, the Carmine Blades had at last found an explanation for the strange symptoms that afflicted them, which they had worked hard to conceal from those around them. The Carmine Blades are known to be savage but insular warriors. Their new corps of Sanguinary Priests have struggled to curb the worst of the Chapter's excesses.
Templars of the Covenant	The Templars of the Covenant are a Space Marine Chapter. During the Psychic Awakening, the Ordo Xenos requested that the Templars of the Covenant, Rift Cobras and Iron Hounds Chapters attack the Ork infested Kebban Sub-sector. The Xenos were at war with each other at that time and the Ordo sought their destruction before a Warlord rose to unite the Orks. The Templars sent four companies in response.
Scythes of the Emperor	The Scythes of the Emperor (or Emperor's Scythes) are a Codex Chapter of the Adeptus Astartes. The advance of Hive Fleet Kraken overwhelmed the Chapter's home world of Sotha and virtually destroyed the Chapter for many years. However, in the Age of the Dark Imperium they have experienced a rebirth.[12a] The Scythes of the Emperor's history originated during the Horus Heresy, where the 199th "Aegida" company of the Ultramarines fought bravely against the Night Lords in the Battle of Sotha. Subsequently, Roboute Guilliman honoured the company with the emblem of two crossed scythes, representing their defence of the farmers of Sotha. After the Heresy and the Second Founding, the Aegida Company was maintained as a phantom 11th Company under the command of Captain Oberdeii, in defiance of Guilliman's own Codex Astartes. When Rogal Dorn initiated the Third Founding nearly a millennium later, Oberdeii was the last surviving member of the company. Nevertheless, the Ultramarines' Chapter Master, Tigris Decon, wished to remove the evidence of Guilliman's 'heresy', sending Chaplain Segas and Brother Wenlocke to offer Oberdeii the choice of being reassigned to the 5th Company or continuing to guard the Pharos by becoming Master of a new 'Aegida Chapter'. Oberdeii reluctantly agreed to found a new Chapter, but chose to name them the Scythes of the Emperor. In addition to Chaplain Segas and Brother Wenlocke, seventy-two veterans of the Orlan Conquest were assigned to the new Chapter.
Blood Wings	The Blood Wings are an extinct Blood Angels Successor Chapter.[1a]
Sentinels of Uphrateus	The Sentinels of Uphrateus are a Space Marine Chapter. Their Homeworld is Uphrateus, which lies close to the Eye of Terror and was used by the Imperium as a vital base for guarding against Chaos incursions. However in M41, the Sentinels' Homeworld was engulfed by the Eye and the Chapter was thought lost to the Imperium. Because of this, their name was stricken from the Roll of Chapters afterwards and no effort was made to reclaim the Sentinels' homeworld. But while the influence of Chaos had turned Uphrateus into a world of madness, the Sentinels survived and remained loyal to the Imperium. When it soon became infested by the forces of Chaos, the Sentinels then began a campaign to reclaim Uphrateus from the invaders. This brought the Chapter into conflict with the Word Bearers of the Chaos Lord Saegius Mindblighter, who had constructed a necropolis upon the Sentinels' homeworld. Mindblighter preached his heretical sermons from a cathedral within the necropolis, which was later attacked by the Sentinels. Despite suffering grievous casualties, the Chapter was able to successfully breach the cathedral's defences and in doing so, they also weakened the grip the Eye of Terror had on their homeworld. This allowed Uphrateus to break free of the Eye and after 200 years it returned to Realspace.
Index Astartes	Index Astartes is a column in the White Dwarf magazine, a series of books collecting those columns, and a fictive document in the Warhammer 40,000 universe. The article series focuses on the Space Marines, describing their background, genetics, individual Legions and Chapters, vehicles, etc. While most of the older articles have been collected in the four books, some can be found only in White Dwarf. Below is a list of all Index Astartes articles published so far with White Dwarf issue numbers and Index Astartes compilation book volumes in which to find them. Note that although the list aims to be complete, some articles may still be missing. Many articles published in the White Dwarf magazine during September 2000 and April 2005 were later compiled in paperbacks collections :
Storm Callers	This article needs work on its citations.For help on citation see the citation guidelines. You can help Lexicanum by fixing it. The Storm Callers are a Space Marine Chapter that took part in the Taninim Crusades in the latter half of M37. Whilst they were in the Taninim Expanse the Storm Callers were corrupted by Chaos, leading to civil war within the Chapter. The outcome of that civil war is not known, nor is whether the Chapter still exists, whether loyal or renegade, in the 41st Millennium.[Needs Citation]
Blood Lords	The Blood Lords are a Space Marine Chapter that have acquired all manner of vehicles for their armory, during their service to the Imperium. Among them is a Nephilim Jetfighter, which is normally only used by the Dark Angels and their Successor Chapters. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here. The Blood Lords were created by the Games Workshop employee Ian Huxley and they were featured in Warhammer: Visions 28.

An updated and revised edition was released in 2019 with new artwork. Cover art for Re-released The Sabbat Worlds Crusade by Dan Abnett (2006)
White Panthers	The White Panthers are a Space Marine Chapter. They follow the strictures of the Codex Astartes closely.[6b] In the year 332.M39 the White Panthers responded to a transmission made by an Inquisitor Bastalek Grim, who had uncovered plans of the government of Kethra to secede from the Imperium. A White Panthers strike force proceeded to completely destroy Kethra's military capabilities, including wiping out its Planetary Defence Forces, stormed the Governor's palace, and executed the traitorous leaders. Inquisitor Grim saw this as needlessly rendering an essentially Imperial world defenseless. When the planet Thagra IV was invaded by the Alpha Legion, the White Panthers were sent to liberate the planet. The planet had mutants working in slave mills. During the rebellion some of the mutants joined the Alpha Legion's attacks, while some remained loyal and resisted the invasion through guerrilla warfare, among them Quovandius. The White Panthers eventually drove the Alpha Legionnaires off, afterwards rounding up the mutants for execution, including those who had fought against the invading Alpha Legion, considering them all to be traitors. Ready to execute them all, the intervention of Inquisitor Gregor Eisenhorn forced the Panthers to spare the loyalist group of Quovandius' mutants.
Storm Falcons	The Storm Falcons are a Space Marine Chapter. In 997.M41 their homeworld Talon was absorbed into Hive Fleet Leviathan under the direction of the Swarmlord. The planet is categorised as abandoned, though whether it was in this state prior to being absorbed by the Tyranids is unknown.
Red Hunters	The Red Hunters are a Space Marine Chapter with ties to the Inquisition (as shown by the Inquisition symbol on their armour). The Red Hunters are one of the rare chapters that worship the Emperor of Mankind as a god.[3a] Their uniform is red, with a white skull with a black Inquisition symbol on its head as a Chapter badge. So strong is the link between this Chapter and the three great Inquisitorial orders that rumours abound that they had been founded at the request of the Inquisitorial Representative on Terra, and that there was a secret pact between the Inquisition and the Chapter for mutual support. The Chapter is tied to the Inquisition by ancient bonds of honour and duty and are often called upon to face the servants of the Ruinous Powers and other fell enemies of Mankind. Fighting in Inquisitorial strike forces and providing protection for the most senior Inquisitor-Lords, the Red Hunters have confronted numerous horrors no mortals can face and be allowed to live should they survive, lest they taint others.[7a]
Red Knights	The Red Knights are a young Blood Angels Successor Chapter. Their Gene-seed gives each member a prominent glowering mien.[2a]
Star Scorpions	The Pure, often known as The Basilisks are a Chaos Space Marine Warband.[1a] Formerly they were a loyalist Space Marine Chapter known as the Star Scorpions (Androctonus Astra in High Gothic; also known as the Scorpions Legion) of the Twenty Fifth Founding. Officially they are considered by the Imperium as a destroyed chapter that was lost in the Warp.[1a] In fact, after disappearing in the Warp, the Star Scorpions had changed by kneeling to the service of the Chaos powers and become The Pure, a Chaos warband.[2b] The Star Scorpions Chapter was created in the Twenty Fifth Founding in late M40, known as the "Bastion" Founding.[1c] They were designated with the Chapter number 888.
Solar Hawks	The Solar Hawks are a Successor Chapter of the White Scars. The Solar Hawks are from an unknown founding, but date back to at least M35. They are known to be aggressive and noble, embodying the spirit of Jaghatai Khan. As their name suggests, they field a large number of airborne assets, regularly deploying whole wings of Stormtalons and Stormravens into battle.
Sons of Fire	The Sons of Fire are a Space Marine Chapter. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here. The Sons of Fire were among several Chapters that were created for White Dwarf 299 (UK)'s Creating a Chapter article.
Burning Blood	The Burning Blood are an extinct Blood Angels Successor Chapter.
Scimitar Guard	The Scimitar Guard are a Space Marine Chapter. Not much is known of them, save that they contribute to the Deathwatch.
Auric Paragons	The Auric Paragons are a Space Marine Chapter. Known to be an ancient chapter, they are one of the few that worship the Emperor as a god. Since the formation of the Great Rift, their homeworld of Jüell is now located near the Nachmund Gauntlet within the Choraplex. Seeing themselves as the last bastion of order in the region, they see it as their sacred duty to purge the Gauntlet of the Emperor's enemies. Their Fortress-Monastery is lush and beautiful, but almost entirely unmanned due to the enormous losses they have suffered since the formation of the Great Rift and the repeated invasions of their homeworld. Many of their Gene-Seed was tainted, making replacing losses impossible. They would have been entirely wiped out had it not been for the arrival of a Torchbearer Fleet bringing Primaris Space Marine reinforcements. The Chapter's few remaining vessels deploy warriors all over the region as their supplies and numbers continue to dwindle. They are resorting to religious blackmail and aggressive tactics with the people they encounter to secure support needed to continue fighting for the Emperor.
Ignus Hortanium	The Ignus Hortanium are a Space Marine Chapter. They hail from a Shrine World and are a devout Chapter, who believe in the cleansing power of fire. This has led the Hortanium to often seek out the forces of Chaos and use flame based weapons to burn them from the [[galaxy]. The Chapter's power armor has a burnt appearance because of this. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Ruby Crescents	The Ruby Crescents are a Blood Angels Successor Chapter.[1c] They once had an outpost on the Imperial world Camarth, which contained a garrison of the Chapter's forces. They resided in the fortress Redmoon Keep, from where the Crescents watched over the people of Camarth, who in turn greatly honored the Chapter[1b]. However disaster struck, when the Great Rift's creation, isolated Camarth within the Imperium Nihilus. Now cut off from the wider Imperium, the world was preyed upon by the Ten Thousand Eyes Warband, who launched a devastating invasion. Despite the efforts of the Crescents' garrison on the world, Camarth was brought to ruin.[1a] However the Warband had specially targeted Camarth, because of the Ruby Crescents' isolated garrison. The Ten Thousand Eyes' master, Seraphax, wanted to use the Crescents as research material for his experiment known as the Bloodrage Project, which sought to find ways to unleash the mindless ferocity that was hidden within all of the Primarch Sanguinius' sons. During the invasion, nine of the Crescents were captured at great cost[1d] and were then imprisoned in one of the Redmoon Keeps cells. After being chained to the cell's walls together, the captives' blood began to be drained into a giant vat beneath its floor, where it was somehow turned into a glowing liquid.[1c]
Storm Dragons	The Storm Dragons are a Space Marine Chapter. The Storm Dragons are known to have committed forces to the Sabbat Worlds Crusade. Notably, in the Solypsis campaign, a squadron of Storm Dragons Terminators sacrificed themselves to banish the infamous Bloodthirster An'ggrath the Unbound.
Imperial Fists	This article contains text passages or images with citation issues. The concerned content is marked with "Citation issue" tags. Please help to improve this article by fixing those issues as described in the corresponding Help article. Do also note that it is absolutely forbidden to add new information or content to these marked passages as long as the pre-existing citation issues have not been completely resolved. The Imperial Fists were the VII Legion of the original twenty Space Marine Legions. Their Primarch is Rogal Dorn. The Legion remained loyal during the Horus Heresy, after which it was reorganised according to the Codex Astartes and divided into Chapters. The Imperial Fists have maintained an intense rivalry with the Iron Warriors since prior to the Horus Heresy, with whom they share a specialisation in siege warfare. The Imperial Fists are recognised to be among the most loyal Chapters to the Emperor and have been instrumental in holding the Imperium together during the bleakest of times with renowned stubborn resilience.[16b] Because of their service to the Imperium, especially their role in leading the defence of Terra during the Horus Heresy, the Imperial Fists are also known as the "Defenders of Terra." The Imperial Fists were formed on Terra as the VIIth Legion. The Legion was one of the few that recruited entirely from their homeworld and were the only formation to have recruited from across all of Terra, including areas where other Legions claimed exclusive "Rights of Tithe." Despite recruiting from such a wide range of locations, VII Legion recruits consistently possessed a taciturn nature and were quick to action but reserved in speaking .[37b] The Legion had the benefit of being united with their Primarch shortly after their formation, while their character had yet to take fully shape and as much as 70% of their ranks were still aspirants. As result, the Imperial Fists and Rogal Dorn developed as servants of the Imperium together, forming an unbreakable bond based upon the common desires for self-discipline and total commitment to order found in Dorn's temperament and the gene-seed of the Legion.
Praetors of Orpheus	The Praetors of Orpheus are a Space Marine Chapter, created from the Ultramarines during the Second Founding. The Praetors of Orpheus are stationed on the world of Beta Entebes II within a subterranean base, which serves as their Fortress Monastery, called the Labyrinthe of Orphia.[2a] They are known for their disciplined approach to the Codex Astartes and are completely inflexible in their adherence to the tome. While the Codex is their guide in all things, they are prone to interpreting passages too literally. The technological lore of the Praetors of Orpheus is second only to that of the Adeptus Mechanicus. Many believe that the two are tied by more than shared service in the Emperor's name. The Praetors of Orpheus are highly active in the systems neighbouring Pavonis.
Administratum	The Adeptus Administratum, also known as the Scriptists and the Enumerators[5a], is the administrative and bureaucratic division of the Adeptus Terra, consisting of untold billions of clerks, scribes and administrative staff constantly working to manage the Imperium at every level, from assembling war fleets to levying taxes. It is the largest of the departments comprising the Adeptus Terra—the mere administration of the Imperial Palace is estimated to involve over ten billion adepts.[1a] The Administratum was created as the Imperial Administration, and was under the control of Malcador, titled the Chief of the Imperial Administration.[1a] Billions of Administratum officials on Terra and throughout the galaxy are constantly carrying out population censuses, working out tithes, recording and archiving information, and the million other things that are necessary for the running of the Imperium. Such is its immense size and complex bureaucracy that whole Administratum departments have been lost and forgotten. So dogmatically bureaucratic, whole departments of adepts continue to diligently but purposelessly carry out the role their department was founded for, even after the department has become long obsolete. Of all the Imperium's divisions, the Administratum is regarded as the least prestigious, but its high ranking members are among the most powerful men in the Imperium. Despite its massive inefficiency, the Administratum is so integral to the running of the Imperium, that without it, the whole Imperium would grind to a halt. As a result, the Master of the Administratum is the most powerful member of the High Lords of Terra. Many Administratum positions are hereditary; parents pass on their ranks and positions to their children, who continue the work that had occupied the lives of their ancestors. Typical Administratum adepts labour within gargantuan vaults, sitting at logic-engines, and can be considered learned by Imperial standards.[1a]
The Art of Warhammer 40,000	The term "Art of Warhammer 40,000" has been used for different publications pertaining to the Warhammer 40000 artwork :
Destroyers	The Destroyers are a Space Marine Chapter descended from the White Scars. Established during the Second Founding, the Destroyers have a troubled history. Though they have won great victories in the Imperium's name, questions remain regarding the stability of their Gene-seed, and concerns have grown surrounding the sheer savagery of their conduct in battle. This reputation persists despite their heroic self-sacrificing deeds in the wake of a Daemonic rampage in the Lhorgus Sub-sector. For their part, the Destroyers are only concerned with the next mission.
Silver Templars	The Silver Templars, known also as the Swords of Novaris[4d] are an Ultramarines Successor Chapter. They are noted as being amongst the first Primaris Chapters created during the Ultima Founding.[3a] While most Successor Chapters of the Ultramarines are well-disciplined tacticians, the Silver Templars are famed for their audacity, daring and being incredibly skilled duellists. The Silver Templars have gained a reputation as cold and utterly focused warriors who display little emotion. They are expert duelists, preferring to select a single target and focus their attention on eliminating chosen opponents before selecting a fresh target. Silver Templars strategy often revolves around carving a path to enemy leaders, so that their most powerful warriors can engage the foe in a duel of death. They are also accomplished weaponsmiths, often crafting their own weapons and establishing a link with its Machine Spirit known as the Bond Martial. Once this bond is established, a Silver Templar will devote himself to mastering the weapon's use. Losing a bonded weapon is a mark of shame in the Chapter and they will go to great lengths to reclaim any lost item.[4d]
Astral Spears	The Astral Spears are a loyal Space Marine Chapter. During the Indomitus Crusade, the Torchbearer Fleet Conqueror's Forge delivered Primaris Space Marine technology to the Chapter.
Storm Giants	Symbol is a red lightning bolt striking upward. The Storm Giants are a Salamanders Successor Chapter. While this has long been rumored[2b], it has only recently been proven true. They have fought in several of the Imperium's greatest and most pivotal wars, not least among them the Third War for Armageddon. The Storm Giants display high physical strength even for the standards of Space Marines, and there is some debate that their Gene-seed may have mutated to enhance their Biscopea. Several Magos Genetors have made requests to study the Chapter's gene-seed but they have refused on each occasion.
Exemplars	The Exemplars are a Space Marine Chapter.

Emperor's Spears	The Emperor's Spears are a Space Marine Chapter. Their primary purpose is to protect the region known as Elara's Veil as part of an alliance known as the Adeptus Vaelarii. The Chapter's homeworld is Nemeton, an aquatic planet with small landmasses. They rely on a large fleet that surpasses those of most Chapters due to their alliance with the Forge World of Bellona, focus on air superiority, and many of their warships carry support legions of Skitarii. The Emperor's Spears are believed to have come from the 25th Founding, also known as the Bastion Founding, in the latter half of M40. Even before the opening of the Great Rift, at this time Elara’s Veil was beset by conflict that stretched the ability of the Celestial Lions to defend it. A petition was made to the Senatorum Imperialis for reinforcements, and the next Space Marine Founding saw the Lions joined by two new Chapters, the Emperor’s Spears and Star Scorpions. Together these three Chapters formed the Adeptus Vaelarii - the Sentinels of the Veil - and were bound by a sacred oath to protect the region. The first known appearance of the Chapter was in 594.M40, making them relatively young by the standards of Space Marine Chapters. In the Spears' first sighting they answered the call of a deep-void Adeptus Mechanicus hydroponics installation. Here they were noted by witnesses to have been needlessly aggressive, heedless of collateral damage, and lingered after the battle to harvest the heads of their dead xenos foes. In their first millennia of existence they focused heavily on expanding their Chapter Fleet. Even in their relatively short history, the Emperor’s Spears have clashed with their fellow Space Marines, notably the Aurora Chapter during the Eukari Insurrection. So vicious was the conflict that the Ultramarines sent representatives to quell it, ruling that the Emperor’s Spears had acted rashly and were to blame for the violence. It is only in recent years that High King Arucatas the Swordbearer has eased the tensions that exist between the Emperor's Spears and Ultramarines.
Avenging Sons	The Avenging Sons are a Space Marine Chapter, of Ultramarines descent. The Avenging Sons are based on the world Traekonnis Major. They are one of the 10 Shield Chapters of Ultramar, and for this role have been granted the world of Callimachus by Roboute Guilliman. In 970.M41, the Chapter's Third Company went renegade and forsook the Imperium.

Star Dragons	The Star Dragons are a Codex Chapter of Space Marines. The Star Dragons practice ritual scarification, inlaying their deep cuts with electoo circuitry that causes them to glow like caged stars. There has been speculation that they are descended from Ferrus Manus, but lack the cold logic of their Iron Hands brothers. Instead, they are guided by furious passions and unleash their wrath upon the enemies of the Emperor.

Sons of the Phoenix	The Sons of the Phoenix are an Imperial Fists Successor Chapter. The Sons of the Phoenix were among the Primaris Space Marine Chapters created during the Ultima Founding, at the direct order of Roboute Guilliman, and were created during the Indomitus Crusade. Faithful to the Emperor and ritualistic in their battle cant, the Sons of the Phoenix pride themselves on plunging into the flames of battle. They are constantly on holy crusades, which are led by their Chaplains and pave the way for the Imperial Creed to spread to numerous worlds. Because of this, the Chapter's crusades are often followed by many Adeptus Ministorum priests and pilgrims.[3b] Since the opening of the Great Rift, the fleets of the Sons of the Phoenix have been scattered and they are now desperately trying to regroup.
Stone Gauntlets	The Stone Gauntlets are a Space Marine Chapter. The Chapter took part in the Imperium's defense of the worlds in the Medina Corridor from a Chaos invasion.
Gore Golems	The Gore Golems are a Space Marine Chapter.
Star Phantoms	The Star Phantoms are a loyalist Space Marine Chapter who played a pivotal part in the Badab War.[2a] The Star Phantoms are a Chapter whose many victories remain unsung because of its own penchant for secrecy and isolationism. As part of the Sentinel Founding early in the 38th Millennium, the Chapter was founded to shore up the defenses of the Imperium in many vulnerable parts of its vast domain. Initially based in the Mausoleum world of Haakoneth, the Chapter became fleet-based by necessity upon the destruction of the planet in 120.M40, and since that time had been grimly plying the space lanes of Segmentum Obscurus. The Chapter was counted as one of those who participated in the Macharian Crusade, but after the death of Solar Macharius participated in the Imperial civil war known as the Macharian Heresy. The Star Phantoms were said to have been subsequently responsible for the annihilation of the 17th Terrax Guard on Thoth, and the near destruction of their former allies, the Marines Malevolent. Ultimately, the Chapter was cleared of heresy by the Inquisition.[2h] The Chapter arrived in strength in the Maelstrom Zone in 912.M41, mostly due to the intervention of Legate-Inquisitor Frain and his acolytes, and pledged all of its ten Companies to the Loyalist cause[d]. The Chapter's fleet, led by the battle barge Memento Mori, played a pivotal part in the destruction of the infamous Ring of Steel star fort network surrounding the Badab system.[2a]
Warrior Adepts	The Warrior Adepts are a Space Marine Chapter.
Libators	The Libators are a Space Marine Chapter. The Libators are among the most brutal and uncompromising Ultramarines successors. Their name stems from the practice of letting their foes' blood and dedicating it as an offering to the Primarch and Emperor both. The Chapter has faced censure on several occasions for its treatment of captured enemies, who in the Libators' eyes, make for the worthiest offering.

Astartes (Animation)	Astartes is an online animated series by Syama Pederson. The project began in 2018 as a purely fan effort, but has since received official Games Workshop support. Assaulting an enemy vessel, the Adeptus Astartes face hordes of foes, cunning witchcraft, and terrifying unknown technology as they seek to bring rebellious enemies to justice.
The Aegidan Oath (Short Story)	The Aegidan Oath is a short story by L.J. Goulding, published online on 17 December 2016 as Day 17 of Advent 2016.

Auric Patricians	The Auric Patricians are a Space Marine Chapter.
Meridian Shields	The Meridian Shields are a Space Marine Chapter. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here. The Meridian Shields were created by the Games Workshop employee Ben Humber and are featured in several White Dwarf issues. While the Chapter's name was initially spelled as Myridian Shields in their first appearance in White Dwarf 476, later issues have consistently spelled it as Meridian Shields.
Brotherhood of a Thousand	The Brotherhood of a Thousand is a later-founding chapter of unknown origin. The Brotherhood follows the Codex Astartes and is loyal to the Imperium. Their chapter symbol is a black "M" on a slightly undersized white circle, the M representing the number one thousand.

Crimson Axes	The Crimson Axes were a loyalist Space Marine Chapter descended from the Executioners (successors of the Imperial Fists). As of 092.M39, the chapter is reported to have been lost.
Black Consuls	The Black Consuls are a Successor Chapter of the Ultramarines Legion, and are one of the 20 Astartes Praeses chapters. They were created in the Second Founding. The Black Consuls were formed shortly after the Horus Heresy. Arrias Cordos was their first Chapter Master. The Black Consuls are a Primogenitor Chapter and were known to be the least compromising of the successor chapters, dogmatically following the Codex Astartes no matter the situation. For the vast majority of their history they were a Crusading Chapter, stationed aboard the ancient star fort Noctis Obscurum. However, in M40 Dark Eldar saboteurs infiltrated the Obscurum and detonated the ancient fort's Warp drive. Afterwards the Black Consuls relocated to the planet Cyclopia. They spent the next three centuries on a vengeful crusade against Dark Eldar, purging fifteen star systems and invading the Webway itself and collapsing an entire sub-dimension.
Necropolis Hawks	The Necropolis Hawks are a Raven Guard Successor Chapter. The Necropolis Hawks were among the Primaris Space Marine Chapters created during the Ultima Founding at the direct order of Roboute Guilliman, and were created during the Indomitus Crusade. Trained extensively in close-quarters warfare and veterans of a dozen close-fought city fights, the Necropolis Hawks are stoic and efficient in their warfare. They bear their battlefield role insignia upon their backpacks so that their comrades can identify them even in the choking smoke and dust of urban war. The Necropolis Hawks specialize in urban combat, and used their skills against the Gellerpox Infected on Vigilus.[2a]

Marines Errant	The Marines Errant are a fleet-based Space Marine Chapter, operating at the fringes of galactic space. A star-spanning Chapter of noble renown, the Marines Errant were formed during the 23rd Founding from the Eagle Warriors and thus are descended from the gene stock of Roboute Guilliman and the Ultramarines. Like most chapters of the period, they have spent their existence on perpetual crusade against the many foes of mankind. They are one of the few Chapter's known to have crusaded far beyond the edge of Imperial space and returned.[3c] The Marines Errant follow the tenets of the Codex Astartes, though they have slightly modified it to better accomodate their Fleet-based status. Each of the Chapter's company captains and high officers are also assigned flag command of a particular fleet vessel (most commonly a Cruiser) and are expected to act autonomously for extended periods. Most Marines Errant taskforces are highly independent and equally expected to operate alone for many years. Even recruitment is practiced in this nature, with individual taskforces recruiting new Aspirants as they travel the stars and only returning them to the 10th Company for Scout training when it's practical to do so. The 1st and 10th Company's are nominally based on their flagship Battle Barge but are in practice usually dispersed as needed to individual commands. Because of all this, the Marines Errant were thought to have stood well above the mandated strength of a Chapter in the Codex Astartes before the Fall of Vilamus.[3a]
Knights of Abhorrence	The Knights of Abhorrence are a Dark Angels Successor Chapter. In the first eight centuries after their Founding, the Knights of Abhorrence fought solely within the Ghoul Stars. There, the Chapter bloodied their swords with the viscera of some of the most dangerous Xenos the Imperium has ever encountered. In the years since, the Knights of Abhorrence have patrolled the outer reaches of the Imperium, slaughtering Xenos horrors whilst acquiring information on the Fallen Angels. It was they who first alerted the Dark Angels' Supreme Grand Master, Azrael, to the events in the Somnium Stars. The Chapter also maintains the secret 57th Protocol with the Deathwatch, which send its Battle Brothers to serve with the Xenos hunters.
Sons of Antaeus	The Sons of Antaeus are a Space Marine Chapter. Part of the cursed 21st Founding, the Sons of Antaeus have a mysterious existence. It is unknown what exactly went wrong, if anything, in the creation of these mysterious Space Marines. What is known is that they are extremely durable and resistant to pain. The earliest official Imperial record that lists the Sons of Antaeus is the Chronicles of the Third Inter-Guild War of the Inca Sector, 850-901.M41. The Chapter is listed as having answered the pleas of the Guild Fathers for aid against pirate forces sponsored by business rivals, and according to the records, acquitted themselves courageously before departing.
Death Strike	The Death Strike are a Space Marine Chapter, of Imperial Fists descent. The Death Strike make use of a number of planets besides their homeworld for recruiting purposes. Known recruitment worlds for the Chapter include Gydisk Tertius.[7b] The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Black Ravens	The Black Ravens are a Space Marine Chapter. In 946.M41, the Khorne Warband known as the Harvest used blood-portals to launch an invasion on the Black Ravens' Fortress Monastery. During the days of fierce fighting that followed, the Harvest killed every last Loyalist within the Fortress's walls and then used its defense lasers to blast apart the Ravens' orbital shipyards. The Warband then dropped the fortress’ void shields and prepared for their true battle to begin, as a tendril of Hive Fleet Behemoth filled the skies of the Black Ravens' Homeworld.
Mentors	The Mentors (or Mentor Legion) are a loyalist Space Marine Chapter. The Mentors are a secretive chapter, who prefer to work alone. They are untrusting of other chapters. Currently, they are in battle with Biel-Tan Craftworld Eldar and Orks of the Charadon System. On their founding they were designated with the chapter number of 888, a number previously belonging to the Star Scorpions Chapter. The Star Scorpions were a Chapter of the Twenty Fifth Founding and had the dual misfortune of producing redundant gene-seed and being devastated by warp entities after becoming lost in the warp. Although what exactly happened to the Chapter is unknown, the Emperor decreed the Chapter be considered dead. The gene-seed of the Star Scorpions survived, although the mutated gene-seed made Adeptus Mechanicus efforts to rebuild the Chapter futile.[Needs Citation] During the Twenty Sixth Founding, the Adeptus Terra assigned one of the newly created chapters (the Mentor Legion) with the colors and number of the Star Scorpions. The Mentors were given an entirely new generation of genetic material[10d] collated from the storage banks of the Ultramarines (or one of their descendants) in the Terran laboratories.[10f] The Mentors are a specialist Chapter and their modus operandi is quite different from that of the bulk of the Adeptus Astartes. The Mentors have an extraordinary capacity for learning, particularly of military matters. Because of this, the chapter's main pursuit is perfecting the fusion between science, the art of war and military technology. The Mentors do not engage in campaigns or wars as other chapters do, but instead "loan" squads of Marines to other Imperial forces for the duration of a battle or sometimes a whole campaign. Squads of Mentors may be found fighting alongside the Imperial Guard or even other Chapters throughout the galaxy.
Shadow Griffons	The Shadow Griffons are a Space Marine Chapter. They served in the Indomitus Crusade Fleet Primus as part of Battle Group Faustus's Task force IX, alongside the Angels Penitent.
Tauran	The Tauran (also - Taurans) is a Codex Chapter of unknown origin. The Chapter is shrouded in mystery, though it is known that they have crusading fleets that only rarely appear in Imperial histories. They also honour a tithe owed to the Deathwatch and send staunch Veterans to stand amid the Xenos Hunters' ranks. The Taurans wear bone armour with black greaves, helmet, aquila, backpack, and markings. The Chapter's symbol is a black bull's head on a bone field.
Golden Paladins	The Golden Paladins are a Space Marine Chapter. In the aftermath of the Great Rift's creation, during the Thirteenth Black Crusade, the Chapter's Homeworld Lynoxis was invaded by a massive Death Guard force, led by the Daemon Primarch Mortarion. Lynoxis soon fell to the Death Guard and it is not known if any of the Golden Paladins managed to escape Mortarion's grasp.
Storm Ravens	The Storm Ravens are a Space Marine Chapter. The Storm Ravens Chapter is only known due to its creation of the Suppression Force tactic by the Master of the Arsenal Jagrveli Skyhammer (sometimes Jagrvelj). Fighting in the Rhopara Crusade, Skyhammer, armed with two centuries of knowledge, stripped down several Land Speeders in order to increase their sensor capabilities in order to create fast-moving forward observers for Whirlwind artillery batteries. Using this tactic, the Rhopara Sector capital fell and the tactic was adopted by the rest of the Chapter and eventually the Adeptus Astartes as a whole.
Sons of Gorgax	The Sons of Gorgax were an Adeptus Astartes Chapter declared lost under unclear circumstances. It has been suggested that the chapter failed to collect enough gene-seed and were therefore unable to replace battle losses.
Brothers of Jarad	The Brothers of Jarad are an extinct Blood Angels Successor Chapter.
Brazen Minotaurs	Show company colour on left knee pad The Brazen Minotaurs are a Codex Chapter.
Penitent Blades	The Penitent Blades are a Dark Angels Successor Chapter. They hail from a world with a landmass that is composed of thousands of smaller landmasses, suspended kilometers in the air above acidic oceans. How this phenomenon occurs is a mystery, but it has ensured the Penitent Blades are aerial combat experts. This has led the Chapter's 2nd Company to have four oversized squads providing gunship pilots, rather than the two in most other Unforgiven Chapters.
Direglaives	The Direglaives are a Space Marine Chapter. They took part in the Charadon Campaign, as part of Battle Group Tarsus, under the command of Captain Daisu'ka. During that time, the strike force was stationed aboard the Strike Cruiser Deathblow.
Star Leopards	The Star Leopards are a Space Marine Chapter. A force of Star Leopards, under Captain Fragman, encountered Eldar Harlequins in possession of a captured Land Raider, sacrilegiously redecorated in a garish fashion. The Marines were honour-bound to avenge the insult. As the lascannons began to fire, the Star Leopards broke into a charge, taking heavy losses.
Black Vultures	The Black Vultures are a Space Marine Chapter. The Chapter is composed entirely of Primaris Space Marines and they are meticulous planners, and long-range marksmen, who will wait patiently to launch their attacks, until they can ensure victory. This has led to some heated interactions with more direct Chapters, like the Space Wolves, who may even bluster that the Black Vultures are cowardly. Since their creation, the Black Vultures have established close ties with the Adeptus Mechanicus and will often undertake operations suggested by the Tech-Priests. During these missions, in which members of the Mechanicus will retrieve relics, the Black Vultures will secure assets that will benefit the Chapter and help them receive support from Forge Worlds. Because of these links, the Black Vultures receive preferential treatment, when it comes to the wargear they receive from the Mechanicus. As their Chapter Master is inspired by the teachings of Lord Commander Guilliman, he intentionally stationed the Chapter's Fortress-Monastery close to an established Imperial world. The Chapter interacts with the world's population much like the Ultramarines do with the Realm of Ultramar and through their proximity, provide some protection for these citizens. This has allowed the Imperial world's System, to develop as a trade hub.
Stone Hearts	The Stone Hearts are a Space Marine Chapter. They are mentioned as having their 4th company attached to a Rogue Trader called Tyrel Cathek. During the Era Indomitus, a servant of Kryptman wrote a document about the forces fighting in the Octarius War. In a section dedicated to the Adeptus Astartes, he wrote that some Rogue Traders have alliances with Space Marine Chapters. The Stone Hearts are mentioned as a Chapter that still has this kind of alliance to this day. The Stone Hearts mark themselves with an intricate tattoo, each one denoting a battle that they fought.[2b]
Sons of Galathor	The Sons of Galathor are a Space Marine Chapter. Their Homeworld, Throne of Galat, is currently being invaded.
White Dwarf 237 (UK)	Warhammer 40,000: Battlefleet Gothic: An overview of the contents for Warhammmer Fantasy Battles can be found here.
Sons of Ares	The Sons of Ares are a Space Marine Chapter. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Imperial Paladins	Pauldron trim denotes company The Imperial Paladins are a Codex Chapter of unknown origin. Sometime during the Macharian Crusade, the 4th Company of the Imperial Paladins was possessed by unknown Xenos on the Ocean World of Nereus. During the Macharian Heresy, the Minotaurs hunted down and destroyed the corrupted Marines.
Mantis Warriors	The Mantis Warriors (or Mantis Legion) are a Space Marine Chapter, who sided with the rebel Astral Claws during the Badab War. They were granted the Emperor's forgiveness at the conclusion of the conflict. The Mantis Warriors are believed to have been created during the Eighth Founding and were assigned to watch over the Endymion Cluster. Like many Chapter's assigned to oversee the far-flung frontiers of the Imperium, they long stood alone in their watch and became used to autonomy and solitude. The Chapter has a shrouded past that is difficult to study, and has always displayed a fundamentally independent and aloof nature that is largely uninterested in the affairs of the wider Imperium.[6a][6b][6k] The isolationist nature of the Mantis warriors all changed in 587.M41 when the High Lords declared that they were to be incorporated into the newly formed Maelstrom Warders alongside the Astral Claws and Lamenters. This alliance would ultimately ruin the Chapter.[6a]
Keepers of the Chalice	The Keepers of the Chalice are a Space Marine Chapter. They have a fanatical hatred of Chaos and Warp corruption, which the Keepers will go out of their way to exterminate. When they wage such wars, the Chapter favors using flame weapons and use ferocious close assaults to root out such heresy. So firm are they in this conviction to purge the Warp's taint, that the Keepers will justify whatever collateral damage they cause to do so. The Chapter's power armor scheme reflects this and is meant to capture the image of both purity and constant war. The white represents sanctity, but it is left covered in numerous scratches and battle damage, in order to show the Keepers never stop fighting. By doing so, the Chapter shows resilience and endurance as they serve as a knightly bulwark against the outer darkness. However, some Inquisitors suspect the Keepers are hiding a heretical degeneracy within their Chapter. Though none have yet secured proof of this, the Keepers appear to go to great pains to hide hints of a dark secret they hold. The Chapter has also either lost or never possessed records concerning who their progenitor is.
The Metatron	The Metatron are a Space Marine Chapter with close ties to the Ordo Xenos. Metatron Space Marines are highly independent and are often seen operating on their own, as advisors to the Imperial Guard, or as members of senior Inquisitors' Retinues.

Penumbra's Talons	This article or article section is based on information from a Fanatic Press publication such as Fanatic Magazine or one of its predecessors (e.g. The Citadel Journal, Necromunda Magazine, etc.). These publications regularly featured articles submitted by hobbyists, and as such, their content may or may not be in contradiction to established background lore. The Penumbra's Talons are a Dark Angels Successor Chapter, whose Homeworld is Belon.[1a] However despite being descended from the Dark Angels, the Penumbra's Talons are not considered to be part of the Unforgiven. This is due to the Chapter's unusual origins in the lost generations of the Great Warp Storm. The Penumbra's Talons are also known for their renowned Techmarines[1a] and for the superior equipment the elite of their Terminator ranks are given. This includes the Terminators' Power Armor being equipped with superlative communications and sensors systems, as well as boosted servo-mechanisms.[1b]
Scions of Mathellax	The Scions of Mathellax are a Space Marine Chapter.
Condemnors	The Condemnors are a loyal Space Marine Chapter. During the Indomitus Crusade, the Torchbearer Fleet Conqueror's Forge delivered Primaris Space Marine technology to the Chapter.
Death Spectres	The Death Spectres are a Space Marine Chapter. Stationed beyond the boundaries of the Imperium, they maintain a careful watch over the Ghoul Stars to ensure that their supernatural inhabitants never again threaten the galaxy.[1a] The date of the Death Spectres' Founding is unknown, though they are speculated to be of the 13th Founding. Their parent chapter is the Raven Guard.[7a] Their founder, Corcaedus, brought the Death Spectres to Occludus after receiving a vision from the Emperor Himself, which directed him to a secret cavern underneath the world's surface containing a xenos artefact of immense power, the Shariax.[7f] After the Horus Heresy Occludus was controlled by the Death Guard Blackshield Crysos Morturg, though his fate by the time of the 13th Founding is unknown.
Tome Keepers	The Tome Keepers are an Ultramarines Successor Chapter assigned to watch over Segmentum Pacificus.[4a] The Tome Keepers were founded in 546.M32 in the wake of the War of the Beast. The war had bled the Imperium's armies and a new Space Marine Chapters were desperately needed. Gene-Seed was taken out of cryo-storage and new samples received from all extant chapters. It was from Ultramarines’ gene-stock that Chapter 281 – later to be known as the Tome Keepers – was born. As with most newly created Chapters, officers and specialists were requisitioned from the parent Chapter. Captain Caelus Viator of the Ultramarines 2nd Company was made the first Chapter Master and he oversaw the creation and training of 400 battle-brothers over the following two decades on the training world of Dornak IV in Segmentum Solar. Their Serfs, fleet and vehicles were provided by Macragge. By 567.M32 the Chapter was ready for service.[4a] Assigned to watch over Segmentum Pacificus, the Chapter moved into the Caracros Sector, a sparsely populated region of space filled with Eldar Corsairs, Ork warbands, and Hrud. It was at the world of GB-6-77 (later known as Istrouma) that the Chapter would make its home. Though a forgotten footnote, the people of Istrouma welcomed the Imperials with open arms and hailed them as the mythical sky warriors of old. At the capital city of Niveneh the Space Marines met the planetary council and learned of the planets long history. There they learned that the life expectancy of Istrouma had fallen over the thousand of years and few now lived past the age of 30. Nonetheless each family dutifully crafted precious artifacts, passing it on to their successor once they died. The artifacts thus took on new meaning, representing the collective knowledge, skill, and will of entire generations. The Space Marines were then taken to the great library beneath Niveneh, witnessing aeons of knowledge. The contents of the library would shape the Chapter's future over the ensuing millennia.[4a]
Blood Ravens	"None shall find us wanting." (After Third Aurelian Crusade) , "Victory over death!" (After defeating the Necrons on Kronus) The Blood Ravens are a mysterious Chapter of Space Marines dedicated to the acquisition of knowledge as well as service to the Imperium of Man. The Blood Ravens possess a cadre of powerful Librarians and are noted for their ability to predict enemy movements and fall on them with the precise application of force required. Their origins are unknown and a cause of much speculation to themselves and to others.[2d]
Stormwatcher	The Stormwatcher Chapter is a Space Marine Chapter. The Chapter's existence is a secret that few amongst the Imperium are aware of and they have sworn to aid the Inquisitors of the Caligari Sector, in defending that blighted realm. As such, the Stormwatchers are the sanctioned blades of the Caligari Conclave, though only high ranking Inquisitors know of them and are allowed to use the Chapter's strength to ensure the Caligari Sector's safety. Because of the nature of their missions, the Stormwatchers refer to themselves as the Watchers in the Shadows and are few in number; though, whether this is by design or due to high attrition rate is unknown.
Blood Reavers	The Blood Reavers are a Space Marine Chapter.
Knights of the Crimson Order	The Knights of the Crimson Order are a Dark Angels Successor Chapter.[1a] Despite the Chapter being reduced to half of their strength from their latest campaigns, the Knights of the Crimson Order answered Supreme Grand Master Azrael's summons to take part in the Battle of the Caliban System in late M41. This was due to their Grand Master, Dane, being utterly loyal to Azrael and being willing to risk the entirety of the Crimson Order to uphold its honour in the Supreme Grand Master's eyes.[1a] Terminator

The Dark Krakens echo this in battle seeking out the largest foes - whether that be in terms of physical size or sheer numbers.
Castellans of the Rift	The Castellans of the Rift are an Ultramarines Successor Chapter. The Castellans of the Rift were among the Primaris Space Marine Chapters created during the Ultima Founding, at the direct order of Roboute Guilliman, and were created during the Indomitus Crusade.

The Hammers of Dorn venerate their primarch, Rogal Dorn, to a degree far beyond those of the Imperial Fists' successors. Their Chaplains teach that Dorn was the favoured son of the Emperor, as he stood shoulder to shoulder with his father during the darkest days of the Horus Heresy. The Chapter's teachings on Imperial history see a rivalry between Dorn and his brother Roboute Guilliman, and the Hammers of Dorn maintain this rivalry with the Ultramarines and their successors, though this rivalry has yet to express itself in combat between the two chapters, honourific or otherwise.[Needs Citation] The Hammers of Dorn also have a very real hatred for the Word Bearers Traitor Legion, the Ultramarines' ancient foes, apparently born out of a determination to prove themselves superior to the Ultramarines and their successors.
Wardens of the Philae	The Wardens of the Philae are a Space Marine Chapter. During the Indomitus Crusade, the Chapter unexpectedly made contact with the Torchbearer Fleet Gladius Ad Umbra, in the Afqal Sub-sector. The Fleet had been dispatched there to reinforce the Lions Azure Chapter and give them the ability to create Primaris Space Marines. However the Fleet had been unable to locate the Lions in the Sub-sector. After checking their records, however, Gladius Ad Umbra discovered that the Wardens' history, over the last three millennia, closely resembled the Lions. So much so, that the Fleet's commander could not be certain if the Chapters were one and the same or not.
Disciples of Blood	The Disciples of Blood are a Successor Chapter of the Blood Angels.
Heralds of Vengeance	The Heralds of Vengeance are a Space Marine Chapter.

During the period of 153.M34 to 184.M39 the Imperium lost any contact and it was somewhere during these five millennia that the Marines turned to Chaos, and rechristened themselves the Skulltakers. Warband symbol
Blood Scythes	The Blood Scythes are a Blood Angels Successor Chapter.[1a] An Ultima Founding Chapter, the Blood Scythes' first campaigns have been in the on-going efforts to purge the Red Scar of Tyranids. This was after the Chapter was united with the Sanguinary Brotherhood, after the Devastation of Baal and they have swiftly embraced the Blood Angels' traditions.

Grief Bringers	The Grief Bringers are a Space Marine Chapter. A company of the Grief Bringers under the command of Commander Hachard was led by the Lord Inquisitor Torq Serpilian to the world of Valhall II, where they suffered heavy losses fighting against an Enslaver infestation that was inciting rebellion in the local populace against the Imperium. Losses included the company's Techmarine and a Chaplain, leaving approximately 3 squads and a variety of accompanying equipment (including no fewer than 3 laser cannon armed Land Raiders). Afterwards, they accompanied the Inquisitor to another world Delta Khomeini V, onboard the cruiser Human Loyalty, to track down a powerful young psyker. En route, Serpilian reinforced his numbers with 2 squads of Ogryns and a Squat engineer. Upon finding the psyker the Grief Bringers encountered what possibly was an early model of an Imperial Knight Titan (gunmetal-grey with unknown heraldry) whose pilot was lost in the warp for eons predating the Dark Age of Technology. Serpillian suspected that the Knight survived onboard a Space Hulk lost in the Warp looking for a psychic beacon strong enough and compatible to open a portal. While in the Warp, Serpillian also surmised that the consciousness of the Knight was possessed by a Daemon who was not able to take full possession of the being, as there was no physical body to stamp its mark onto. The Grief Bringers lost several more marines in the encounter and one Land Raider.
Crimson Raptors	The Crimson Raptors are a Space Marine Chapter.
Chapter Approved 2004	Chapter Approved 2004 was a supplement for the 3rd Edition of the Warhammer 40,000 game. It was subtitled The Fourth Book of the Astronomican in reference to the original Book of the Astronomican, as it continued the series of books that collected the most popular and significant developments for the game published in White Dwarf Magazine. 'Chapter Approved 2004' contains many of the same articles as its predecessor, and should be seen more as an update of relevancy, rather than a compilation of entirely new material.

Covenant of Fire	The Covenant of Fire are a Salamanders Successor Chapter. The Chapter was among those Salamanders Successor Chapters that were created by Archmagos Dominus Cawl, during the Ultima Founding. Cawl did so without informing the Salamanders and when they learned of this, they began making contact with their Successors Chapters. Once contact was made with the Covenant of Fire, the Salamanders then sent one of their Chaplains to teach their Successor of the Promethean Cult. The Covenant of Fire eagerly embraced it, and swiftly applying the wisdom of their gene-sire Vulkan. As a Chapter, the Covenant of Fire crave knowledge of the Imperium they fight for and seek out lore wherever they can find it. In doing so, the Chapter hopes that this information can help them bring light to darkness. Conversely, they purge any sign of heretical material they find, knowing that its knowledge is a false light that leads only to ruin. They were among the Salamanders' newly created Successors, who honored their Founding Chapter by aiding in the search for the Artifacts of Vulkan. In the Covenant of Fire's case, they deployed multiple Companies to take part in the effort. They then accompanied Vulkan He'stan on his journey to the world of Zero. However on Zero, it was revealed that the Alpha Legion had infiltrated the Chapter and swayed much of the planet to their cause. In the subsequent battle the Salamanders and their successors prevailed, but no source of the Unbound Flame was revealed.

Brazen Annihilators	The Brazen Annihilators are an Imperial Fists Successor Chapter. Even for being scions of the Imperial Fists, they emphasize the use of heavy ordnance in battle. Because of this, by the time the Annihilators' warriors charge home, their enemies' positions have already been reduced to little more than scorched bloody craters.

The entirety of the 1st Company was obliterated assaulting the Ork-infested Space Hulk the Revenant Rex, taking every one of the Chapter's Terminator suits with them. When the 1st Company heard a countdown sounding onboard the Hulk, they teleported into its enginarium, hoping to sabotage its warp drives before it jumped back into the Warp. However, they found it already sabotaged by the Legionnaire. Before they could escape, the Hulk exploded, detonating its warp drives and opening an immaterium anomaly in Real Space that wiped out everyone on board.

Black Dragons	The Black Dragons are long rumored to be a Salamanders Successor Chapter [5a]. The chapter was founded in the cursed 21st Founding, just prior to the Age of Apostasy.[1a] The Black Dragons are chiefly known for their status as a Cursed Founding chapter, and for their uniquely peculiar gene-seed mutation; their Ossmodula zygote has mutated, producing bony crests on their heads and blades from the forearm and elbow. Similar to the Death Company of the Blood Angels, those with these abnormalities join a separate unit, known as the Dragon Claws. In this unit, they sharpen their protrusions to a killing edge and coat them with adamantium to turn them into horrifying Close Combat Weapons.[1a] These forearm blades can be retracted into the Claw's arm and then extended at will. The most extreme mutations also cause rampant growth in the rest of the Marine's skeleton; some Dragon Claws stand more than three metres tall and must wear custom power armour to fit their gargantuan frames.[3b] There are many in the Inquisition who doubt their loyalty and several other chapters refuse to fight alongside them, including the Dark Angels and Marines Malevolent. [1a]
Ebon Knights	The Ebon Knights are a Space Marine Chapter. One of their Captains, Revellion, has since become a notorious servant of Khorne.
Excoriators	The Excoriators are a Space Marine Chapter. Created during the Second Founding alongside the Black Templars and Crimson Fists, the Excoriators are known as attrition fighters and stubborn to the extreme. The first Chapter Master of the Excoriators was the Imperial Fist Captain Demetrius Katafalque. Their "survival no matter the odds" mentality stems from the dark days of the Horus Heresy itself. The Marines who would eventually become the Excoriators were stationed on the walls of the Imperial Palace by Rogal Dorn himself with one order: Do not lose.[Needs Citation] Although it is unclear if this is the Chapter's motto, the Excoriators still fight as if their Primarch himself was expecting them to hold the line.
Rogal Dorn	"There is no enemy. The foe on the battlefield is merely the manifestation of that which we must overcome. He is doubt, and fear, and despair. Every battle is fought within. Conquer the battlefield that lies inside you, and the enemy disappears like the illusion he is." Rogal Dorn, also known as the Praetorian of Terra was the Primarch of the Imperial Fists Space Marine Legion created from Dorn's genome. He was one of the twenty Primarchs created by the Emperor in the earliest days of the Imperium, just after the end of the Age of Strife. Dorn, like his brothers, was randomly transported across the galaxy by the Gods of Chaos and placed on a far-away world in an attempt to prevent the coming of the Age of the Imperium. During the Horus Heresy Rogal Dorn oversaw most of the loyalist war effort and ultimately orchestrated the defense of the Throneworld during the Siege of Terra.[20a] He was the first known Lord Commander of the Imperium, ultimately ceding the title to Roboute Guilliman. The Chaos emissary to Lorgar called him the Soldier. Very little is known about Rogal Dorn's youth. It is believed that that he was raised on the planet of Inwit in the system of the same name by an ice-caste native to the Ice Hives of the world. The patriarch of the clan, the House of Dorn, soon became as a grandfather to him, and taught him much of tactics and survival. Even after he discovered he was not blood-related to his 'grandfather' Dorn held his memory in high value; he kept a fur-edged robe that had belonged to the man and slept with it on his bed every night. Eventually Rogal Dorn became the leader not only of his caste but of the whole world and then the surrounding region of space, ruling the Inwit Cluster as Emperor of the House of Dorn.[2a] Intrigued by the enormous station known as The Phalanx orbiting Inwit, Dorn spent many years reactivating the vessel.
Relictors	The Relictors are a Renegade Space Marine Chapter, originally known as the Fire Claws. They are believed to have been created from Ultramarines and Dark Angels gene-seed and were one of the Astartes Praeses Chapters which, according to the ancient tome known as the Mythos Angelica Mortis,[1b] were created to guard the Eye of Terror. The Fire Claws generally fought in the area around the Eye of Terror alongside Cadian Shock Troopers. When the Emperor's Tarot showed a badly damaged Space Hulk emerging from the Warp in the Stygies System in Segmentum Obscurus, the Fire Claws were mobilised to investigate. The hulk was codified as the Captor of Sin and contained a Chaos Warband led by a Champion of Tzeentch known as the Excoriator. The Fire Claws used their Strike Cruisers to cripple the hulk and then sent Terminator Assault Squads to investigate it, led by Epistolary Decario[6i] and the shadowy Inquisitor de Marche. The renegades realised they were doomed and made their final stand in the vast engine room, where Decario and de Marche both fought the Excoriator.[6d] The champion carried a daemon sword forged in the heart of the Eye of Terror that had the essence of a Greater Daemon bound within it. De Marche quickly found himself out of his league as his power axe had no effect. His armour was cut open and he had been grievously wounded. Decario's force sword was shattered and his Terminator Armour was cut open in one fell swoop. Fortunately, Decario used his Power Fist to rip the Excoriator's sword arm from its socket. Even though it was wounded, the Champion fought on, smashing down the Librarian and killing four more Terminators before Decario grabbed the nearest weapon and, with a prayer to the Emperor, took off the head of the Excoriator.[6d]
Warhammer 40,000 5th Edition Rulebook	The Warhammer 40,000 5th Edition Rulebook is the 5th core rulebook for the Warhammer 40,000 game. It was released in July 2008 as a hardback.

The hardback book has 304 pages and the cover is printed in colour with the majority of the book being in full colour, although the Reference and the Rules sections remain white and black.

Vehicle ramming has also been included in this edition. Another major rule change is the introduction of "true" line of sight, meaning that in order for a unit to be targeted, at least one model in the unit must be seen by the shooting unit, regardless of cover.

Obsidian Jaguars	The Obsidian Jaguars are a Space Marine Chapter. The Chapter is known for being noble warriors who are stout of heart, strong of arm and are valuable allies of the Space Wolves. During the Psychic Awakening, however, the Jaguars faced disaster, after their Homeworld, Ceibhal, was invaded by a massive Goff Ork horde, while most of the Chapter was fighting elsewhere. The call for them to return had been sent out, but until help arrived Captain Meznan led the Chapter's forces defending Ceibhal. Unless, the Obsidian Jaguars' absent Battle Brothers returned, or the Space Wolves came to their aid, though, Meznan knew it was only a matter of time before their Homeworld fell to the Orks. Unfortunately, by the time a Space Wolves strike force led by the Wolf Lord Erik Morkai arrived, Ceibhal had claimed by the Orks. The Jaguars' warships defending their Homeworld had also been destroyed, but Morkai still hoped to be able to recover the Chapter's Gene seed from their Fortress Monastery. He infiltrated The Sabre with a group of Space Wolves, but it had been desecrated and the Fortress' walls bore the bodies of the Jaguars who had died defending it. To his further dismay, Morkai's group was only able to recover a small amount of the Jaguars' Gene seed, as most of it had been ruined by the Orks. Now seeing that their was nothing more they could do, the Wolf Lord's group successfully escaped off world, shortly before they activated explosives that destroyed The Sabre. However while their Homeworld is now lost, the fate of the surviving Jaguars is not known yet.

Consisting primarily of Primaris Space Marines, these Chapters are intended to reinforce the Imperial war effort in the Indomitus Crusade. They are renowned for their use of orbital strikes and deploying large numbers of Inceptors and Reivers in attacks that plunge their enemies into confusion. More often than not, these tactics result in a swift planetary conquest for the Chapter. The Knights of the Chalice use the same icons, and placement of those, as the Blood Angels to show company and squad affiliation. It's unknown if they also follow their Progenitor Chapter's system when it comes to showing battlefield role or sergeant status.

During that conflict, the Chapter joined the Imperium's Paradyce Reclamation Force as it attempted to save the besieged world Paradyce V. In the ensuing battles, though, the Knights were responsible for much of the Reclamation Force's infighting, as they often came to blows with other Space Marine Chapters.

He along with Angron and Vulkan, was considered to be one of the mightiest warriors amongst the Primarchs. Known for his fierce and wild personality, Leman Russ considered himself the Emperor's most loyal son and executioner, unquestionably carrying out the punishment of the Master of Mankind. The Chaos emissary to Lorgar called him the Brawler. When the Primarchs were spread throughout the galaxy by the forces of Chaos, one came to land in the far north west of the Galaxy on a remote ice world named Fenris. He was adopted by a Fenrisian she-wolf and raised among the wolves, with his two wolf brothers Freki and Geri. One harsh winter, the wolves attacked a village and stormed the food storage facilities. The villagers fought off the wolves, but Leman Russ fought so viciously that all of his brothers escaped alive. Thengir, King of the people of Russ, sent a raiding party of hunters and villagers to remove this menace for good with poisoned arrows and knives sharp enough to slice through oak.[7a]

The Vitrea Mundi PDF revealed their treachery, unleashing a chemical attack that induced mass panic and bloated out the planet's sun. Chapter Master Tarro Pallidax agreed to open the gates of Fortress-Monastery Bas-Silica to help the panicking refugees, but this was a ruse by Alpha Legion forces who stormed the citadel. However the Marines inside lowered the Void Shields of the Fortress, allowing the orbiting Battle Barge Assiduous to unleash a orbital bombardment that annihilated both sides.[2c]

They now model themselves after the Imperial Fists and make sure to follow in their footsteps. Recently in M42, the Jade Paladins struck a blow against the Black Legion causing the traitors to retaliate by invading Praelax.

Vulkan	"The flesh is weak, but deeds endure" - Vulkan to Ferrus Manus Vulkan was one of the twenty Primarchs created by the Emperor of Mankind to lead his Great Crusade and reunite the scattered peoples of humanity. His Space Marine Legion was re-named the Salamanders in his honour. As with all the Primarchs, Vulkan inherited an aspect of his father. However for him this was the unique ability of being a perpetual, making him essentially immortal. Vulkan was able to regenerate fully from any injury, including a death that would vaporize him completely. This ability was unknown to him until the Horus Heresy, and during the Great Crusade he gained a reputation for his empathy towards average humans as well as his craftsmanship abilities. When the Primarchs were scattered from the Emperor's laboratory, Vulkan arrived on the planet Nocturne during the Time of Trial as an infant and was soon taken in by the blacksmith N'bel. N'bel raised Vulkan, naming him after the first king of the salamanders, and the young Primarch considered him his father. The people of his home town Hesiod were astounded by this child, for within the space of three years, he was stronger and bigger than any man in his town. In addition to his massive physical size, he was the quickest mind, and the greatest blacksmith anyone knew of. Indeed, it was not long before Vulkan himself was teaching forging techniques to the people that had not yet been discovered.

The first campaign of the Dark Hunters saw them fighting against the Daemon Engines and corrupted Warlord Titan Repellus Maximal of Warpsmith Hilghar during the Battle of Bloodsteel.

In the aftermath of the Great Rift's creation, during the Thirteenth Black Crusade, the Chapter's Homeworld was invaded by Chaos forces led by the Daemon Primarch Magnus.

Only Librarian Merchsturmer and an astropath survived the battle.[1d] Librarian Merchsturmer later died of his wounds, but saved his Brothers' Progenoid Glands and warned the Imperium of an approaching Black Crusade.[1e]
Storm Warriors	The Storm Warriors are a Codex Chapter of unknown origin. In their duty to the Emperor, the Storm Warriors launch constant Crusades, led by their Chapter Master, which seek lost planets and ancient treasures which greatly aid the Imperium. The majority of the Storm Warriors join these Crusades, while the remainder stay to defend their Homeworld Taran III, and they are aided by ships of the Imperial Navy (among them survey ships, recovery vessels, giant transports and scout vessels). These Crusades take the Storm Warriors a great distance from their Homeworld and can go on for a great deal of time - with the latest led by Chapter Master Calan lasting 15 years of their time as they had entered and re-entered the Warp, but with nearly a hundred passing on their Homeworld. Once the Chapter Master deems a Crusade to be finished, the Storm Warriors begin the journey home with the Imperial Navy vessels filled with their accomplishments. When Chapter Master Calan deemed his last Crusade to be finished, the Imperial Navy ships that accompanied the Storm Warriors, contained ancient artifacts from lost civilizations, treasures from a dozen strange worlds, specimens and recordings and survey results to last a thousand scholars' lifetimes. They also carried representatives of worlds that been isolated in great Warp Storms, who had given up hope that the Imperium would ever find them - until the day the great ships of the Storm Warriors' fleet appeared above their worlds.
Rift Cobras	The Rift Cobras are a Space Marine Chapter. During the Psychic Awakening, the Ordo Xenos requested that the Rift Cobras, Templars of the Covenant and Iron Hounds Chapters attack the Ork-infested Kebban Sub-sector.

Imperial Castellans	The Imperial Castellans are a Space Marine Chapter. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here. The name Imperial Castellans bears a striking similarity to Imperial Castilians (also a Space Marine Chapter). It is however unknown if that is pure coincidence, a spelling mistake or something else. It should be noted however that the word Castilian means "a native or inhabitant of Castile/ broadly: Spaniard". Which seems a somewhat weird choice for a Chapter name (as opposed to Castellan - "a governor or warden of a castle or fort").
Warhammer 40,000 Chapter Approved - The Book of the Astronomican	The first general supplement to the 'Rogue Trader' edition of the game, the Book of the Astronomican featured completely new material, a four part mini-campaign, a number of ready-to-use army lists and the first complete miniatures catalogue for the game.

Iron Hawks	The Iron Hawks are an Ultramarines Successor Chapter They revere their Primarch Roboute Guilliman above all others – save the Emperor – and the Iron Hawks loathe those who have turned their backs on the Imperium. Despite being strict adherents to the Codex Astartes, however, the Chapter has garnered a reputation for the brutal effectiveness of their high-speed assaults aboard Thunderhawk Gunships. In their recent history, the Iron Hawks have just completed a particularly long and grueling campaign. They suffered heavy losses during it and are currently recovering their strength and numbers. The Iron Hawks are blessed with pure and complete Gene-seed.
Cowled Wardens	The Cowled Wardens are a Dark Angels Successor Chapter. Their base of operations lies within the Sirikoid Belt, a part of the region known as the Teras of Piruz. However, rather than having a single Fortress Monastery, the Chapter operates out of several hollowed-out asteroids and are nominally tasked with the purging of the savage Jehangir that terrorize the region. The Cowled Wardens' secret purpose, though, is the investigation of what the Unforgiven believe to be a large Fallen network in the area. Those Fallen that are captured by the Wardens, are imprisoned in icy catacombs the Chapter have carved within a nameless asteroid of the Sirikoid Belt. After the return of their Primarch, it is known that the Lion El'Jonson visited this Chapter, after which he led them to the final victory over the savage alien Jehangir.
The Remnants	The Remnants are a Blood Angels Successor Chapter, whose Iron Halos bear the icons of winged Grails. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view.

Blades of Unity	The Blades of Unity are an Ultramarines Successor Chapter. They are a specialized Chapter and the Blades have been called upon by their Primarch, Guilliman, to carry out the most dangerous of missions.

A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Blood Drinkers	The Blood Drinkers are a successor chapter of the Blood Angels Legion.[17b] Strict followers of the Codex Astartes, the Blood Drinkers have blood-drinking rituals and suffer a literal blood-lust, due to a mutation of the chapter's Omophagea gene seed. Members of the Chapter are described as having a perpetual air of aridity, likely due to the above mutation. While they seem to have overcome the worst aspects of the flaw of the Blood Angels successors, with low incidence of Black Rage and a small Death Company, the truth is that instead of denying or controlling the Red Thirst, they surrender to it.
Widowmakers	The Widowmakers are a Space Marine Chapter. A Company of Widowmakers was committed to the Second War for Armageddon following the first Season of Fire.
Night Sentinels	The Night Sentinels are a Space Marine Chapter. Their Homeworld, Lychnos, is currently being invaded.

Even so, all other Space Marines of the Strike Force Ultra who successfully made the teleportation went on to complete their mission, materialising deep within a Black Legion stronghold and turning its warlord’s throne room into a charnel house. Sometime between M34 and M37, the Chapter engaged in anti-Ork operations at the borders of the Maelstrom. At one point, they managed to corner a large Ork fleet, but their attack was disrupted by the sudden appearance of Fabius Bile's vessel Vesalius. One contingent of Red Scimitars led by Kasra attempted to board the vessel, but were killed by Fabius' followers as the Vesalius escaped from the battle.
Red Consuls	The Red Consuls are an Ultramarines Successor Chapter. The origin of their Chapter's creation is lost to the Red Consuls, who are famed for being grim, uniform and having a cold manner. They also have an intolerance against any kind of individuality being displayed amongst their Battle Brothers.
Epic Armageddon	Epic Armageddon is a tabletop war game produced by Specialist Games, using Games Workshop's Warhammer 40,000 universe. It is the 4th edition of the Epic (game system). The game is sold in the form of a 192 page rulebook and contains rules for massed infantry formations, immense war-machines and Titans from various factions. One interesting feature of Epic: Armageddon is that, unlike previous editions of the game and other games produced by Games Workshop, the development of the game was conducted in an open way with 'trial' rules published on the Epic 'Playtest Vault' and feedback solicited from gamers via the associated playtesters forum. This collaboration with the community has continued with the development of further army lists.

After a hard fought battle, the Terror Tigers defeated the Warlord, but they had lost almost two-and a half Companies worth of their Chapter to the Mutant's forces. When he saw how ravaged his Chapter was left after their victory, the Terror Tigers' Chapter Master ordered his own execution for his failures in dealing with the invasion. Later, when the Chapter received a desperate message from one of their exploration teams before it was destroyed by the Eldar on the newly rediscovered Imperium world Hannibal, the Terror Tigers were still too undermanned to send forces to defend the world. Instead, it fell to a Company of the Imperial Fists Chapter led by Captain Lexandro D'Arquebus to aid Hannibal and avenge the deaths of the Terror Tigers' exploration team.
Retractors	The Retractors are a Space Marine Chapter.
Iron Shield Chapter	The Iron Shield Chapter is a Space Marine Chapter. During the Scouring of Hexdragon XXIV in 345.M38 the newly arrived Iron Shield Chapter suffered severe casualties amongst their Assault Marines during an assault on the Despot of Hexdragon's battle fortress. With all members of the Chapter’s Battle Companies fully engaged, Commander Shakirax ordered the troops of the 10th Scout Company to be issued with jump packs, so that they could fulfill the role of jump infantry instead. Suffering casualties in excess of 90%, the Scouts nonetheless overwhelmed the defenders of the Obsidian Tower, and the fortress fell.
Iron Wolves (Space Marine Chapter)	The Iron Wolves are a Space Marine Chapter. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Marines Vigilant	The Marines Vigilant were a Space Marine Chapter that was destroyed by the Crimson Fists. The minds of the Marines Vigilant were shattered by xenos exposure. After that, this troubled Chapter suddenly and inexplicably became unwilling to fight even xenos forces.. For this reason, the Ordo Malleus and the Adeptus Terra ordered the Crimson Fists to destroy the Marines Vigilant, an attack in which Pedro Kantor took part. Even as the Crimson Fists attacked them, the Marines Vigilant refused to raise a single hand in their own defense as they were destroyed. This action was remembered as the most distasteful in the Crimson Fists Chapter’s history.
Iron Templars	The Iron Templars are a Space Marine Chapter. They bear medieval trappings on their blue and white power armor and are known for working with the Adeptus Mechanicus. A number of their Dreadnoughts have also been heavily modified. The Iron Templars were created by Richard Ranky, who wrote several articles on Games Workshop's old website. The Chapter was featured in one of them.
Bladekeepers	The Bladekeepers are a Dark Angels successor chapter and part of the Unforgiven. They took part in the Battle of Idolatros during the Arks of Omen Campaign.
Azure Hawks	The Azure Hawks are a Space Marine Chapter. A black raptor head on white.
Scar Lords	The Scar Lords were a Space Marine Chapter. The Scar Lords took part in the Damocles Crusade and fought in the invasion of the Sept world Dal'yth. After the Damocles Crusade's conclusion, the Scar Lords led an Imperial fleet that ambushed a T'au force that attempted to reclaim worlds in the Damocles Gulf. Both T'au and Scar Lords suffered heavy losses, but the Xenos were ultimately able to break through thanks to the leadership of Commander Farsight.[5b][5c] Humiliated by this failure, the Chapter pursued the T'au until they reached Vior'los.[5e] The Battle of Vior'los proved catastrophic for the Scar Lords, suffering over 90% losses including their entire leadership.[5e] Inquisitor Vykola Herat subsequently wrote that the Chapter had been "scattered to nothingness"[5f] and the T'au recorded the Chapter as extinct.
Mortifactors	The Mortifactors, alternatively spelt as Mortificators, are a Space Marine Chapter recruited from the Feral World Posul, which is shrouded in almost perpetual darkness. The population of the planet is broken down into tribes, and the mightiest tribe is ideal for recruitment into the Mortifactors. They are a successor Chapter of the Ultramarines. The Mortifactors were founded during the Second Founding by Sasebo Tezuka, who was led to Posul after consulting the Emperor's Tarot. The Mortifactors closely follow the dictates of the Codex Astartes, but their outward appearance differs sharply from the Codex's dictates. These differences are products of the culture of Posul. The Basilica Mortis is the Mortifactors Fortress-Monastery, a star fort orbiting Posul. The halls are filled with rows of engraved skulls taken from the bodies of fallen Space Marines and the main chapel is filled with the skulls of foes claimed in the aftermath of victory. The Chapter's funerary rites are led by its Chaplains, recruited from the priest class of Posul, and many characteristics of the Chapter cult are drawn from their culture. The tribal wars of Posul created a population suited to become Space Marines, and since Posul is a night world, Mortifactors are accustomed to fighting in low-light conditions. Even though Neophytes are inducted and indoctrinated into ways and traditions of the Adeptus Astartes and the Ultramarines' Primarch, they still maintain a significant amount of customs from their original tribes. Some of these traditions include meditating before battle (to reach a death-like trance in an attempt to commune with the Primarch and their ancestors), and drinking the blood and eating the flesh of their enemies after battle (then severing their heads and flensing their skulls).

Vorpal Swords	The Vorpal Swords are a Space Marine Chapter. In mid-M37, the Chapter was among those declared by Saint Basillius to be lacking in faith and was subsequently condemned to the Abyssal Crusade in the Eye of Terror. The Chapter survived the expedition however, and Chapter Master Konvak Lann led a purge against Saint Basillius' status within the Imperium. During the Gheistos Cataclysm in M41, the Vorpal Swords assisted in stopping a Daemonic incursion of the planet Gheistos. The Vorpal Swords deployed via Drop Pods at multiple sites across the planet. One assault attempted to relieve the Planetary Governor's Fortress but was attacked by the rampaging Bloodthirster Skarbrand. Another assault on the Devlan space port surrounded the Daemonic forces and succeed in closing a major Warp Rift.
Iron Drakes (Salamanders Chapter)	The Iron Drakes are a Salamanders Successor Chapter, that was created during the Ultima Founding.
Emperor's Swords (Bellicas)	The Emperor's Swords are a Space Marine Chapter that were seemingly destroyed in 970.M41. As of the time of the Age of the Dark Imperium the Emperor's Swords appear to be campaigning once more. It is the second chapter of this name. The Emperor's Swords had the misfortune that their homeworld was a revealed to be a Necron Tomb World. When the ancient creatures awoke, they rose from the depths of the planet and fell upon the Chapter. Twenty years later the Space Marines of the Fire Lords avenged the Emperor's Swords and eliminated the Necrons on Bellicas. Before their destruction, in 925.M41 the Chapter Master of the Emperor's Swords, Kendral, was slain by the Ork Warboss Skullkrumpa.
Flesh Eaters	The Flesh Eaters are a Blood Angels Successor Chapter. For millennia, they have been rumored to have an unnatural hunger for blood and flesh, but the Flesh Eaters have always ignored this gossip. However their Gene-seed does contain instabilities, which nearly destroyed the Chapter. Because of this, the Flesh Eaters' numbers were greatly reduced by the time they aided the Blood Angels in the Devastation of Baal. The unveiling of the Primaris Space Marines was the Chapter's salvation, though, and their ranks have been swelled with hundreds of reinforcements. Now with the arrival of their new Primaris Battle Brothers, the Flesh Eaters have a chance to continue serving the Imperium.

Void Tridents	The Void Tridents are an Ultramarines Successor Chapter. The Void Tridents were among the Primaris Space Marine Chapters created during the Ultima Founding at the direct order of Roboute Guilliman, and were created during the Indomitus Crusade. Recruited from the Ocean World of Talassar, the Void Tridents follow the naval traditions of the Realm of Ultramar. They are experts in boarding actions and ship-to-ship warfare, though under Lord Commodore Theodro Vethrus, they have also proven themselves in planetstrike operations. The Void Tridents are one of the Chapters assigned by Guilliman to protect the reformed Realm of Ultramar and are also part of the Wardens of the Gauntlet.
Knights Sanguine	The Knights Sanguine was a Blood Angels Successor Chapter, that was consumed by war.
Tormented	The Tormented are a Space Marine Chapter.
Executioners	The Executioners are a Space Marine Chapter of Imperial Fists descent. They sided with the rebel forces during the Badab War, but were granted the Emperor's forgiveness at the conclusion of that conflict.[2h] The Executioners are a Chapter that trace their origins to the tumultuous years following the Horus Heresy. They are descendants of the Imperial Fists, and were said to have been founded and led by Fafnir Rann, said to have been one of the most vicious of Rogal Dorn's Captains. According to the Chapter's own chronicles, they were founded for the express purpose of seeking out and slaughtering the foes of Mankind. Their brutality was displayed in the Invasion of Nova Sulis during the Plague of Unbelief. They ceaselessly pursued this duty for many millennia, until the events of the Badab War.[2e] During the War of the Beast, the Executioners were placed in charge of the defenses of Terra alongside the Crimson Fists as the rest of its forces under Lord Commander of the Imperium Koorland led an invasion of Ullanor.
Iron Crusaders	The Iron Crusaders are a Space Marine Chapter. They were last reported heading for the Ghoul Stars.
Guardians of the Covenant	The Guardians of the Covenant are a Successor Chapter of the Dark Angels, of an unknown founding.[9a][10a] From an unknown Founding but certainly of Dark Angels heritage, the Guardians of the Covenant have fought most of their battles in Segmentum Pacificus, focusing in particular on supporting Crusades into the Halo Stars and Veiled Region.[9a] The Chapter is also known for its extreme monastic nature, constantly studying the teachings of the Emperor and their Primarch, Lion El'Jonson. Reflecting this attitude, their vehicles and armour are usually covered in illuminated religious texts extracted from tomes sacred to the Adeptus Astartes.[9a][10a]
Flame Falcons	The Flame Falcons were a Space Marine Chapter created during the Twenty First Founding and based on the world of Lethe. Like other Chapters of the Cursed Founding, the Flame Falcons suffered from mutations in their gene-seed—in this case resulting in their tendency to spontaneously burst into flame during combat. The Chapter was declared Excommunicate Traitoris and driven from their home world by a force of Grey Knights, thereby becoming one of the Renegade chapters. Little is known about the Flame Falcons, except that the Chapter, alongside the Death Strike, Iron Hands and Genesis Chapter, performed a series of Exterminatus missions on those worlds in the Ulik Sector not yet consumed by Hive Fleet Leviathan. These missions were a success and prevented the Hive Fleet from fuelling itself on the Sector's bio-resources. However, the Flame Falcons were declared Excommunicate Traitoris within a century of their creation. It is said during a campaign on Raffenburg's World, their largest battle yet, that members of the First Company, who were stationed at the front lines at the fiercest of the fighting, began to immolate. This did not harm the Space Marines, only their foes. The lines were reinforced and when news was reported back that the flames were helping the Space Marines, the commander thought it was a miracle, although he had already sent for an Inquisitor, fearing mutation.[Help] The Inquisitor, however, had a different view. Eventually all of the Flame Falcons began to immolate and they began a celebration on their homeworld after the victorious campaign. The Inquisitor had called for the Grey Knights who came and destroyed the mutant marines. It is not known how many marines survived, but there have been sightings of immolated marines on more than one Imperial battlefield.[Help]
White Sentinels	The White Sentinels are a Space Marine Chapter. During the Indomitus Crusade, they were to be reinforced and given the ability to create Primaris Space Marines, by the Torchbearers Fleet Task Force White Sentinels. However the Task Force did not if the Chapter was still active, due to the White Sentinels affinity for dangerous close assaults. As it searched for the Chapter, in the Karenna Sub-sector, the Task Force's commander, Admiral al Pre'golsa, inflicted stinging defeats on any foe it came across. So much so, that when the Task Force finally located the doggedly surviving White Sentinels, the Admiral had inadvertently given the Chapter a new reputation. Now they were known as expert naval tacticians, who were to be avoided in void combat at all costs.
Purgators	The Purgators are a Space Marine Chapter.
Golden Gryphons	The Golden Gryphons are a Codex chapter of unknown origin.

Draconis	The Draconis is a Space Marine Chapter. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Imperius Reavers	The Imperius Reavers are a loyalist Space Marine Chapter of the Imperium. A Successor Chapter of the Ultramarines, they are adept xenos hunters and have become embroiled in many conflicts against the Tyranids, who are their specialty. The Second Company of the Chapter, known on their homeworld of Praedis Zeta as the "Stormbringers", are Tyrannic War Veterans and experts in rooting out Genestealer Hybrids.
Reclaimers	The Reclaimers are a Space Marine Chapter.[4a] Similar to the Iron Hands, the Reclaimers have unusually close ties to the Adeptus Mechanicus, and this association is reflected in several aspects of their Chapter: their Techmarines occupy places of unusual prestige, their Apothecaries are exceptionally skilled in grafting augmetic replacements, and their Power Armour is among the most finely crafted of all Space Marines'.[4b] Moreover, their respect for the Mechanicus borders on a certain amount of reverence, but whether the God-Machine is the main focus of their faith or is seen merely as an aspect of their Primarch or the Emperor Himself, only the Reclaimers themselves know. The Ordo Hereticus may be already aware of this, but even if it is true, for now it seems they have decided to observe and not take any action yet.[6b]
Supplicators	The Supplicators are a Space Marine Chapter.
Fulminators	The Fulminators are an Ultramarines Successor Chapter. The Fulminators were among the Chapters created during the Ultima Founding at the direct order of Roboute Guilliman. They are one of the first Ultima Chapters to be created, having been founded in M31 during the last battles of the Scouring. The Fulminators are named after the electrical storms that rage on Mars and their first generations of Aspirants came from the best recruits heading into the Terran Guard. When the chapter was raised on Mars, the neophytes were sent into the storms as a rite of passage to achieve the status of a brother. The storms left their mark on the Fulminators. The marines of the chapter bear zigzag patterns of lightning-inflicted scars.[6a] Having now been unleashed during the Thirteenth Black Crusade, they have joined the other Ultima Chapters in reinforcing the Imperial war effort in the Indomitus Crusade.
Pain Bringers	The Pain Bringers are a Space Marine Chapter. The Pain Bringers engaged and defeated an Eldar army on the third moon of Vida's World in M38. As a result of this battle, Imperial forces recovered a nearly-intact Fire Prism.

White Dwarf is Games Workshop's premium Warhammer magazine, packed with amazing content each month such as new rules and background, short stories, regular columns, special guests, and more. Here’s what you can look forward to in July’s issue:
Knights Obstinate	The Knights Obstinate are a Space Marine Chapter. During the Thirteenth Black Crusade, the Chapter's Homeworld was overrun by the Ork hordes of Ghazghkull Thraka — sometime after the Warlord had escaped the Imperium's wrath in the Third War for Armageddon.
Iron Angels	The Iron Angels are a Space Marine Chapter. They have lost most of their history after a catastrophe destroyed their original Homeworld as well as the Iron Angels' records and upper echelons of their Chapter. Only a handful of their relics survived the destruction, which left the Iron Angels without their identity or the knowledge of their Founding Chapter. Despite these losses, though, they continued to serve the Imperium and in early M33 the Iron Angels would claim Magdalor as their new home and began recruiting Aspirants from its tribal population. The Chapter also hollowed out the peak of the world's tallest mountain, where they constructed their new Fortress Monastery, known as the Angels' Crown. The last of the Iron Angels' relics were then stored within the Monastery's deepest chamber and only brought forth at times of great peril. Over the following millennia, the Iron Angels fought with courage and honour, but ill fortune continued to stalk them. Due to their staunch code, forbidding retreat in the face of all but certain destruction, any savage conflicts the Iron Angels took part in cost them dearly. Their finite stocks of gene-seed also dwindled, as did the Chapter's recruitment of Aspirants, as Magdalor's population was culled by outbreaks of disease and psychic mutation. These issues persisted even as the Great Rift was created and the Iron Angels found themselves within the Imperium Nihilus. So it was that, when Abaddon the Despoiler led the Vengeful Spirit and a fleet of Black Legion warships into orbit over Magdalor, the Iron Angels were a diminished force of what they once were.
Harbingers	The Harbingers are a Space Marine Chapter of unstated origin. The Harbingers' Homeworld is the Feral World Birmingham "the Black Planet", and their Chapter Master is Nimrod Grudge. They specialise in boarding actions and planetary drop assaults, for which the Chapter has become highly respected. The Harbingers' wear blue and yellow power armour - blue for the torso, helmet, backpack and pauldron rims, yellow for the legs, arms and pauldrons themselves. A Marine's company is shown by the colour of their armour's imperialis.
Howling Griffons	The Howling Griffons are a Space Marine Chapter with a long and glorious history. Few Chapters have won as much renown as quickly as the Howling Griffons.[44b] Their heroism has placed them amidst the most hallowed honour rolls of the Imperium. The Howling Griffons are staunch traditionalists and consider their primary role to be defenders of the Imperium and an instrument of the Emperor's ideals. They see the Codex Astartes as a treatise that has yet to be bettered, rather than holy scripture. As a Chapter, they do not specialize in any one form of warfare and as such maintain an even balance across all disciplines covered by the Codex. Competition within the Chapter is high, but never allowed to degenerate into discord.[7b] They take special pride in their oaths, seeing each as an eternal conflict until the deed is finished. Before battle, additional oaths are added to their already exceedingly long lists, some for the chapter and others more personal. Once an oath is taken, a battle brother goes to extreme lengths to complete it and it is never forgotten, even after decades. Completed or satisfied oaths are a badge of honor, often inscribed on parchments or directly in the armor of the Howling Griffons Space Marines.[2b]
Umbral Knights	The Umbral Knights are a Space Marine Chapter. The Umbral Knights were among the Primaris Space Marine Chapters created during the Ultima Founding, at the direct order of Roboute Guilliman, and were created during the Indomitus Crusade. The Chapter aided Lord Commander Guilliman's Crusade until it moved further into the Dark Imperium and the Umbral Knights ultimately remained behind to help defend the worlds already freed by the Crusade.
Doom Warriors	The Doom Warriors are a Codex Chapter of unknown founding and origin. The Doom Warriors have a defect in their Catalepsean Node. Because of this their Space Marines do not sleep, which in turn makes them a morose and moody Chapter. This is why they specialize in cleansing campaigns.[Needs Citation] This article needs work on its citations.For help on citation see the citation guidelines. You can help Lexicanum by fixing it.
Inquisition	The Holy Orders of the Emperor's Inquisition, more commonly known as the Inquisition, are the powerful secret police of the Imperium responsible for guarding the souls of humanity. The purpose of the Inquisition is to identify and destroy the myriad of potential threats to the Imperium and humanity. Such is the Inquisition's power that it answers only to the Emperor. Founded in the aftermath of the Horus Heresy, the organisation's members are agents known as Inquisitors. The actual founding of the Inquisition is shrouded in mystery and there are at least two different stories surrounding its formation.
Guardians of Celeres	The Guardians of Celeres are a Space Marine Chapter of unknown origins.
Grey Knights	Some text passages and/or images of this article have been removed due to insufficient Citations and placed under Quarantine on this article's Discussion page until proper citations have been provided.

"One unbreakable shield against the coming darkness, one last blade forged in defiance of fate, let them be my legacy to the galaxy I conquered, and my final gift to the species I failed." - Inscription upon the Arcus Daemonica, attributed to the Emperor of Mankind. The Grey Knights are a Space Marines Chapter and the Chamber Militant for the Ordo Malleus. The Chapter specialises in the hunting and extermination of Chaos daemons.[2a]
Knights of the Raven	The Knights of the Raven are a Codex Chapter. The Knights of the Raven have a mysterious background, with only a scant few details known about them within the ranks of the Adeptus Astartes, Deathwatch, and the Inquisition. When they do fight alongside other Imperial forces, the Chapter communicates only when necessary and use their own cryptic battle tongue amongst themselves. Due only to the coincidence of similar iconography and title, the Knights of the Raven are assumed to be a chapter founded during a Later Founding using Raven Guard gene-stock in the latter half of M38. In M42 Chapter Master Shrike referred to the Knights of the Raven as the Brothers of the Raven Guard.[12b]
Vipers Penitent	The Vipers Penitent are a Space Marine Chapter.
Emperor's Storm	The Emperor's Storm is a Space Marine Chapter. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here. In The Complete Games Workshop Catalog and Hobby reference - The 2004-05 Edition a Emperor's Storm HQ squad is shown, created by Golden Demon 2002 winner Joe Hill, where they are red with white faceplates, pauldron trims, and arms, and their symbol is a white raptor head on red.
Doom Legion	The Doom Legion is a Space Marine Chapter of Ultramarines descent. A majority of the Chapter was corrupted into the Chaos Space Marine warband known as the Vectors of Pox during the Abyssal Crusade in M37. The Doom Legion was responsible for maintenance and garrison of the Faithful's Deliverance, the pre-Heresy star fortress that overlooks the notorious Elusian Maze asteroid fields. Few other Space Marine Chapters could boast space-borne firepower of this magnitude.[2a] The Chapter's homeworld is the artificial planet of Elusia Prime.[2b] Over time, the Doom Legion was all but forgotten by the rest of the Imperium, left in that distant outpost, fighting endless wars against the denizens of the accursed sector. The Doom Legion was one of the thirty Chapters sentenced to the Abyssal Crusade. Because of their duty of watching over the Elusian Maze, only six companies took part in the Crusade, instead of the entire Chapter. Five of these were corrupted into the Vectors of Pox warband. After the crusade, the Inquisition subjected the Doom Legion to rigorous examinations to seek for corruption, though found none.
Dark Eagles	The Dark Eagles are a Codex Chapter of Space Marines. They are allegedly a Successor Chapter of the Raven Guard, whose exact founding date is unknown. Dark Eagles Marine Dark Eagles Marine from the 3rd Company

Marines Errantor	The Marines Errantor are a Space Marine Chapter. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here. The Marines Errantor are listed by name only in Chapter Approved 2001. This may be an editorial error, confusing the chapter with the Marines Errant, which are listed in the same book.
Valiant Blades	The Valiant Blades are a Space Marine Chapter. The Valiant Blades were among the Primaris Space Marine Chapters created during the Ultima Founding at the direct order of Roboute Guilliman. Sometime after their creation, the Chapter's ships unintendedly received a plea for aid from House Hawkshroud, while traveling through the Warp, which had been meant for the Knight House's allies. The message said that the Knights' home of Krastellan was being invaded by the Orks of Waaagh! Zagsmasha and they desperately needed to call upon the debts their allies owed them, in order to save their world. Though the Chapter were not among those who owed such a debt, the Valiant Blades turned their ships' helms towards Krastellan to aid the beleaguered Knight House. Whether they will arrive in time to be of any help though, is unknown.
Fervid Blades	The Fervid Blades are an Imperial Fists Successor Chapter from the Ultima Founding. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here. The Fervid Blades were created by the Games Workshop employee Tom and they appeared in White Dwarf 515.

They are one of the twelve Chapters that send a champion to the centennial Feast of Blades, and are the only Chapter to have won on two consecutive occasions.
Golden Sons	The Golden Sons are a Successor Chapter of the Blood Angels.[1a] The Chapter was Founded in M38 and were charged with patrolling the northern reaches of the Galaxy. The Golden Sons' ships were said to have an auric quality to them and each housed a portion of the Chapter's fabled Librarius.[1a] The Chapter's Battle Brothers were considered warrior-scholars and wore golden tattoos on their faces.[1b] They were among the Blood Angels' Successor Chapters that took part in the Devastation of Baal.[1b] The war with Hive Fleet Leviathan destroyed the Golden Sons' fleet and reduced them to only a handful of scattered survivors.[1a]
Black Guard	The Black Guard are a Raven Guard Successor Chapter that was created during the Second Founding. During the Horus Heresy, the Primarch Corvus Corax reorganized his Legion's badly depleted Shadow Wardens into the Black Guard and named Gherith Arendi as their commander. The Chapter believes in the timely application of overwhelming firepower to defeat their foes and are masters of the careful ambush. During battles they deploy massed batteries of Thunderfire Cannons and Vindicators to annihilate their enemies in an instant; as overkill or half measures are not concepts which the Black Guard understand. As a result of this, they are known to leave vast cratered ruins in the wake of their many victories.
Masters of Protelus	The Masters of Protelus are a Codex Chapter of unknown founding.
Deathwing (Anthology)	This article needs work on its citations.For help on citation see the citation guidelines. You can help Lexicanum by fixing it. Deathwing is a short story anthology of tales set in the Warhammer 40,000 Universe, edited by Neil Jones and David Pringle (although the Black Library website states that it was edited by Marc Gascoigne and Andy Jones). It was originally printed in 1990, but was reprinted by Black Library with three new stories in 2001, with the original stories revised to adhere to the current background.
Imperators	The Imperators are a Space Marine Chapter. The Chapter's armour is primarily coloured dark blue, with red pauldrons and stabilising jets, and white pauldron trim and kneeplates. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Flames of Aries	The Flames of Aries are an Imperial Fists Successor Chapter. The Flames of Aries are a headstrong Chapter, which found themselves within the Imperium Nihilus, in the wake of the Great Rift's creation. With the Imperium now beset by numerous foes, Chapter Master Rigentus led the Flames of Aries' fleet into a series of unrelenting battles, to stem the tide. Eventually, though, the Chapter met their match in the Ork infested Villipan System, where they were surrounded after carving a path through the Xenos' forces. With their end in sight, the Chapter decided to fight a glorious last stand and were destroyed by the Orks. Unbeknownst to the Flames of Aries, however, a Torchbearers task force, led by the Custodes Shield-Captain Galion Magethus, had been searching for the Chapter in order to give them the tools needed to create Primaris Space Marines. By the time they arrived in the Villipan System, though, it appeared the task force was too late, until Magos Dominus Zuhulis Vul discovered life-signs aboard the Chapter's damaged Strike Cruiser, Spear of Aries. A group of 20 Flames of Aries, led by the Librarian Salas Dimarco, still lived, but they were fighting off a horde of Orks that had invaded the Spear of Aries. Shield-Captain Galion Magethus, led his Custodes to their aid and alongside him were the Greyshield Primaris Space Marines sent to reinforce the Chapter, led by Captain Alagon Mors. Together the Imperials were able to destroy the Orks and the Torchbearers then began to rebuild the Flames of Aries. Soon the Chapter was given the ability to create Primaris and was reinforced with ten Companies worth of former Greyshields. The Spear of Aries was also repaired and with the seeming death of Rigentus, Alagon Mors was made the Flames of Aries' new Chapter Master.
Iron Ravens	The Iron Ravens are a Raven Guard Successor Chapter. The Iron Ravens chapter with their home planet of Taltos were lost to the Warp. After the Great Rift's appearing, the Inquisition and the Raven Guard faced the possibility that the planet Taltos had reappeared, and that perhaps the Chapter based there fell to worship Chaos God Nurgle, turning into Raptors. The newly created Chapter is composed entirely of Primaris Space Marines and many of them fought in the early years of the Indomitus Crusade, as Unnumbered Sons. As a result of this, the Iron Ravens do not fight like other Raven Guard Successors, as they have learned different tactics from other Chapters. This has left them very adaptable on the battlefield and the Iron Ravens will take on the tactics of other armies, where they see fit. Their 10th Company will gather intelligence for months to adapt to whatever situation or foe they face, making the Chapter more flexible in combat. When the main body of the Chapter then strike, they will unleash their specialty of sudden, shocking Drop-pod assaults that win the war in a single unstoppable blow. These precise destructive strikes are called "the Blade of Corax", by the Iron Ravens.

During the subsequent Battle of Malak, the majority of Fleet Quartus was lost though it is unknown how many Void Talons survived.[1a]
Dark Imperium (Game)	Dark Imperium is the starter set for the 8th Edition of Warhammer 40,000. Across the war-torn battlefields of the 41st Millennium, Mankind battles for survival against myriad horrifying foes. Beset on all sides by hostile aliens and threatened from within by traitors, Humanity’s only chance for survival rests with the continuation of the cruel and bloody regime known as the Imperium. Yet few among Mankind’s untold population realise the full truth of their situation. If there is any future at all, it is a grim one... Intercessors
Jade Dragons	The Jade Dragons are a loyalist Space Marine Chapter, although they appear to hold little respect for the Imperium they serve. They are staunchly secretive and few outside the Chapter know anything more than the basic details. Codex Noctis Verminium tortured out of Thelso Delyer, Lord Archivist of the Librarium on Morkevid presents the history of the hunt for the Infinity Worm (also called the Black Leviathan). Started by Lord Inquisitor Trintis Ven and 2 battle companies of the Jade Dragons lead by Captain Nu Falleo, the hunt has become the driving force for all Chapter actions. The chapter prefers fast assault and shock tactics with lightning claws and seeker rounds for their boltguns and bolt pistols.
Sons of Medusa	The Sons of Medusa are a Successor Chapter of the Iron Hands.[1a] The Sons of Medusa, although born out of strife and discontent, share much in common with their parent Chapter in terms of organisation and philosophy. They, too, abhor mortal weakness and place an unusual reliance on technology and equipment.[1a] The Founding of the Sons of Medusa is highly unusual in that, technically, they were never actually founded at all. Their origins lie within an Imperial civil conflict known as the Moirae Schism, which itself occurred during the Nova Terra Interregnum. During this schism, which affected all branches of the Adeptus Mechanicus and those Imperial factions closely tied to it, the Iron Hands chapter stood on the brink of destroying itself in an internal chapter war. However, the ruling council of the Iron Hands, the Great Clan Council, was able to settle the matter by getting all concerned to agree to a simple solution; the Moirae dissidents were to be exiled from the chapter, with all parties swearing never to take up arms against each other. In the wake of this ruling, almost a full third of the chapter split away to become a fleet-based divergent branch of the Iron Hands. Over time, they increased their numbers (by accepting Moirae dissidents from other Iron Hands successor chapters as well as traditional recruiting) and by the time the Moirae Schism was over, the Moirae Iron Hands were reckoned to stand at chapter-strength.[1a]

Lion Warriors	The Lion Warriors are a Codex Chapter of unknown origin.
Lion El'Jonson	"Loyalty is its own reward" Lion El'Jonson, also known as The Lion and The First, is the Primarch of the Dark Angels. He was scattered along with the other Primarchs to the far corners of the galaxy. He finally came to rest on the world Caliban, a beautiful but blighted world tainted by Chaos due to its proximity to the Eye of Terror. Lion El'Jonson was renowned for a level of strategic brilliance and martial prowess that was rivaled perhaps only by Horus, but was distrusted by his brother Primarchs for his secretive and taciturn nature.. The Chaos emissary to Lorgar called him the Duellist. Having disappeared for ten millennia following the Destruction of Caliban after the Horus Heresy, The Lion has finally returned to the Imperium following the Arks of Omen Campaign.
Iron Fists	The Iron Fists are an Iron Hands Successor Chapter. They carry Storm Shields moulded with a medieval gauntlet and make use of Land-Behemoths. The Iron Fists were the first to develop missiles with an extended range for the Whirlwind. This development occurred during the Assault on Hive Vortis. This longer ranged type of missile changed the short ranged support of the Whirlwind into a long-range bombardment artillery. However, to obtain the distance required for long-range engagement, accelerant was added at the cost of lessening the amount of high explosives. This, in turn, led to a situation when the missiles failed to cause sufficient damage to be effective in their new bombardment role.
Redeemers	The Redeemers are a Space Marine Chapter.
Twilight Magisters	The Twilight Magisters are a Space Marine Chapter.
Deathwatch	The Deathwatch is a unique and specially trained Space Marine Chapter that dedicates its every hour to xenos hunting.[36a] Known as the Shield that Slays[36a], they are the Chamber Militant of the Ordo Xenos, charged with protecting it in its search of information, containment, and ultimate destruction of all xeno species. Consisting of Battle-Brothers drawn from many Chapters, the Deathwatch operates from Watch Fortresses and Watch Stations across the whole of the Imperium. Rather than following the standard Codex Astartes organization, the Space Marines themselves are drawn from many different chapters. These chapters have sworn sacred oaths to raise a unit of Space Marines specifically for this task. The warriors are then gathered together to fight where and when they are needed. Giant fortresses orbit desolate worlds at the edge of the galaxy, keeping constant vigil over possible xenos forces. There are also several secret bases spread throughout the Imperium, which provide a launch site for their crusades.[Needs Citation]
Repentant Brotherhood	The Repentant Brotherhood are a Dark Angels Successor Chapter. In M41, the Repentant Brotherhood answered Supreme Grand Master Azrael's summons to the site of the destroyed planet Caliban, where they joined the Dark Angels and other Successor Chapters to battle the Chaos Space Marines led by Typhus.
Silver Drakes	The Silver Drakes are a Space Marine Chapter. The Silver Drakes were among the Primaris Space Marine Chapters created during the Ultima Founding, at the direct order of Roboute Guilliman. In the aftermath of the Great Rift's creation, the Chapter was charged by Guilliman with turning back the advancement of Hive Fleet Ouroboris. Though their tactics are effective against the Xenos, the Silver Drakes' numbers are few and the isolated Chapter has now dug in for a bloody running war with the Hive Fleet. They dispatched a request for aid which was answered by Imperium Nihilus Regent Dante, who has sent the Charnel Guard, Blood Dragons, and Sable Knights to aid them. In addition Eldar emissaries have arrived and offered aid.
Inceptors	The Inceptors are a Second Founding Space Marine Chapter descended from the Ultramarines. The Inceptors fought during the Macharian Crusade, but during the subsequent Macharian Heresy they came to blows with their former allies, the Doom Warriors over a matter of honour. In the Euxcine System they fought a long-running and protracted conflict under predetermined rules of engagement. They refused to end the conflict, and as a consequence the Minotaurs Chapter was dispatched to end it for them. The two Chapters were caught unprepared and, although the Doom Warriors were able to escape the system, the Inceptors were stranded on Euxcine and were systematically destroyed until fewer than a hundred Space Marines remained. They were forced to surrender. Many of the Chapter's relics, including their flagship - a Great Crusade-era assault ship - were captured by the Minotaurs. The Minotaurs were subsequently denounced across Ultramar and forbidden from entering its boundaries. Other Ultramarine-descended Chapters have also sworn vengeance against the Minotaurs.
Legion of the Damned	The Legion of the Damned are a legendary and mysterious force of Adeptus Astartes. Pale and gaunt Space Marines plated in black power armour adorned with death imagery, they unexpectedly appear from nowhere to help Imperial forces in times of great need. The truth behind their origin is currently unknown for certain, but Inquisitorial investigations have drawn a link between them and the lost Fire Hawks Chapter. The Legion are afflicted by a warp contagion that destroys their sanity; as it progresses their bodies decay, but they grow in supernatural strength. Each Marine is rapidly approaching the moment when he will succumb to the contagion. Combat can initiate the final stages of the disease, in which the Marine reaches a peak in power and enters a berserker state.[1a] A few scholars of Adeptus Astartes have proposed that the Legion of the Damned is a psychic backlash made real. Events such as the Drop Site Massacre or the death of a Primarch were so traumatic they left a permanent scar on the psyches of all of the First Founding Legions, so these theories run, a scar so deep it has permeated not only the Chapters that came after them but hundreds of successor Chapters since that tumultuous time. The Space Marines that have remained loyal to the Emperor since then have a deep-seated belief that those who betrayed them should be made to pay for their transgressions with fire and fury. It is quite possible that the Librarians of the Adeptus Astartes tap into this belief and make it real, whether by accident or design, resurrecting the ghosts of their fallen brothers and giving them a chance to wreak their terrible revenge. These scholars believe it is a Chapter’s burning conviction that the guilty must be punished that gives the phantoms of the Legion a physical form.[4a]
Red Wings	The Red Wings are a Space Marine Chapter descended from the Blood Angels. The Chapter suffered grievous losses during the Devastation of Baal, and now consists mainly of Primaris Space Marines. This has led many of them to be ignorant to the true nature and threat of the Black Rage.[3a] Their Gene-seed gives each member bright white hair. But the new Primaris Space Marines of the chapter lack this distinctive trait.
Iron Scepters	The Iron Scepters are a Space Marine Chapter. They were hurriedly created to respond to a series of World Eaters incursions, but the Chapter lacked the time to fill their armories themselves. Instead the Iron Scepters relied on the Tech Magos assigned by the Fabricator General, to do it for them. Unfortunately, the Magos was reluctant to leave his studies to perform such a "menial chore" and instead gave the Chapter faulty and experimental wargear. The Iron Scepters were already well on their way to confront the World Eaters, when they realized their equipment was defective. Many outsiders, however, believed that the Chapter's problems stemmed from a lack of faith in the Emperor. Rather than using their technical difficulties as an excuse for their defeat, the Iron Scepters accepted them as a challenge. Perhaps the most notable of the defects they faced, were the experimental helmets that had been designed to enhance the Chapter's senses. Wearing the helmets were excruciatingly painful for the Iron Scepters and caused scarring on their foreheads. Though nearly all of the defective equipment has since been replaced, the helmets have been retained as proud symbols of the hardship the Chapter once faced. When an Iron Scepter Scout is initiated as a full-fledged Space Marine, they must wear the helmet until they develop the tell-tale scars of the Chapter. The scars are seen by the Iron Scepters as a constant reminder of their history and humility.
Raven Guard	The Raven Guard were the XIX Legion of the original Space Marine Legions. Their Primarch is Corvus Corax. Their homeworld is Deliverance (originally named Lycaeus), a moon which orbits the Hive World Kiavahr. The Legion was devastated at the outbreak of the Horus Heresy and survived only by the most desperate of measures. The Raven Guard specialise in guerrilla warfare, moving behind enemy lines with unrivaled stealth and striking with precise application of force.
Marines August	The Marines August are a Space Marine Chapter.
Knights of Mhorwen	The Knights of Mhorwen are a Space Marine Chapter. During the Indomitus Crusade, they were to be reinforced and given the ability to create Primaris Space Marines, by a Torchbearers Fleet. However the Fleet had trouble finding the Chapter and descended upon a ruined Forge World, which they believed had dealings with the Knights of Mhorwen. A small force from the Fleet was sent to the world and found the information was located within the data-core of the Archivolt Quranos Forge Temple. Upon entering the Forge Temple, however, the Torchbearers were attacked by hordes of corrupted Adeptus Mechanicus constructs. It was then revealed that the ruined Forge World had been invaded and then infected by Scrap Codes, which caused the Archivolt to create the mechanical hordes. The Torchbearers were heavily outnumbered and they suffered heavy losses before they reached the data-core and escaped with the Knights' location.
Rainbow Warriors	The Rainbow Warriors are an Ultramarines Successor Chapter. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view.

Flame Eagles	The Flame Eagles are a Space Marines Chapter. Allegedly a Successor Chapter of the Raven Guard, their exact founding date is unknown. Trazyn the Infinite has a collection of Flame Eagles helmets, which he sometimes confuses for the Fire Hawks.
Minotaurs	The Minotaurs are a loyalist Space Marine Chapter with a particularly brutal reputation and mysterious ties to the High Lords of Terra.[1b] The Minotaurs are a relatively mysterious Chapter of the Adeptus Astartes, as they are principally notable for the fact that, beyond the last thousand years, most records of them appear to have been locked away under seals so tight even members of the Inquisition find them difficult to open. In addition, other records appear to have been lost or mislaid. The matter is made even more complex by the existence of conflicting historical records relating Minotaurs Astartes chapter. These records have led to uncertainty on if the "Minotaurs" who appeared in M32, M36, and M41 are the same chapter or multiple chapters who have shared the same name. Finally, the chapter is rumored to possess some form of direct tie to the High Lords of Terra themselves that circumvents other forms of Imperial bureaucracy completely, a rumour that has given the Ordo Hereticus some cause for concern.[1b] A chapter listed as the Minotaurs was recorded in action as early as M32, in the suppression of the Solar Rebellion, notably working along side other Astartes chapters. However, other records state that the Minotaurs were not founded until the 'Cursed' 21st Founding in M36. Their recorded actions between M36 and M38 led to the Minotaurs being known as berserkers. While noted for quick responses to calls upon them for aid, they were also known for ignoring command-trees and battle-plans completely and simply engaging the enemy unto their destruction. This reputation for being unreliable allies resulted in the Minotaurs being shunned by the main body of Imperial forces. This suited the Minotaurs fine, and sometime in M38, they simply disappeared from Imperial records.[1b]

There may come a time when men have forgotten all of the glories of our age, forgotten even the Emperor, may He forgive me for saying. But this I swear.

Into the Maelstrom (Anthology)	Into The Maelstrom is an anthology of short stories set in the Warhammer 40,000 Universe. Various authors contribute, and the anthology is edited by Andy Jones and Marc Gascoigne. It was first published in 1999, and is currently out of print, although several of the short stories were re-published in Let the Galaxy Burn (Anthology). "Genestealers! Rius thought.

Hammers of Retribution	The Hammers of Retribution are a Space Marine Chapter.[1a] Their chapter symbol is a pair of ornate crossed Thunder Hammers.[1a]
Mooneaters	The Moon Eaters are a Space Wolves Successor Chapter, that was created during the Ultima Founding. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here. The Moon Eaters were created by the White Dwarf employee Sophie Bostock and they were first featured in White Dwarf 459. While their name was initially Mooneaters, later White Dwarf issues have given the Chapter's name as Moon Eaters.
Illuminators	The Illuminators are an Ultramarines Successor Chapter. They are warrior-knights of valor and nobility, whose Chapter's culture is heavily influenced by the tribes of their Homeworld Samothar. These tribes worship the Emperor as a sun god and the Illuminators believe it is their duty to illuminate the darkness of the Halo Zone, where Samothar resides. In that way, the Chapter ensures the Imperium's foes have no shadows to hide in within that realm. This is also combined with the belief, that the Illuminators must carry the Imperium's light into the furthest reaches of the galaxy as well. As a result of doing so, the Chapter has managed to forge strong bonds with several prominent Rogue Trader Houses. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Silver Eagles	The Silver Eagles are a Successor Chapter of the Ultramarines Legion, created during the Second Founding.
Tempestors	The Tempestors are a Space Marine Chapter.
Red Seraphs	The Red Seraphs are a Space Marine Chapter. They are part of the Triarchy. The Red Seraphs are not a traditional Founding Chapter, as they emerged in a murderous civil war which tore the Blood Eagles Chapter apart. Alongside another splinter faction, the Angels Numinous, they represent the survivors of the Blood Eagles. Despite this background, both the Red Seraphs as well as Angels Numinous upheld the ancient vows of their parent chapter, including their membership in the Triarchy. The Red Seraphim honor their dead by placing them in ornate sarcophagi within the beautiful bowels of their warships.
Shadow Wolves	The Shadow Wolves are a Space Marine Chapter.[1a] They were thought to have been destroyed while fighting alongside the Black Templars, during a Tyranid invasion of their homeworld, Varadon, in 987.M41.[1a][Note 1] Despite this, a strike force of the Shadow Wolves later came to the aid of Cadia during the Thirteenth Black Crusade, in which they joined the Imperial forces' efforts to retake the Chaos held Kasr Belloc. It is not known, though, how many of the Shadow Wolves were able to escape Cadia's destruction at the hands of the Despoiler.
Redeemed	The Redeemed are a Space Marine Chapter.
Lamenters	The Lamenters are a Space Marine Chapter of Blood Angels descent. Long dogged by misfortune, they sided with the rebel forces during the Badab War, but were granted the Emperor's forgiveness at the conclusion of that conflict subject to the undertaking of a penitent crusade. That crusade eventually brought the Lamenters directly into the path of Hive Fleet Kraken, bringing the chapter to the brink of extinction. The Lamenters are a Successor Chapter of the Blood Angels, yet they have avoided the fate of others implanted with the gene-seed of Sanguinius. While they managed to control the flaws of their gene-stock, they still succumb to it in extreme circumstances. Even so, at the close of the Dark Millennium stories have begun to circulate that the Black Rage has returned tenfold after their flawed attempts to cleanse it from their gene-seed. For much of their history the Lamenters have a record of effective and well-intentioned service to the Imperium, yet they have been subject to extraordinary levels of misfortune. Their ill-luck has seen them fighting in more desperate defences and last stands than any other chapter of its age, and they accept it with symbols of grief and lamentation. The Emperor's Tarot predicts that their misfortune will only get worse.

Iron Hounds	The Iron Hounds are an Ultramarines Successor Chapter.[1b] The Chapter hails from the planet Orinus in the Ultima Segmentum[1a] and the legends of their history date back to the Fourth Founding. The Iron Hounds have always been firm allies of their Ultramarines Founding Chapter and they have pledged warriors to the cause of Ultramar on countless occasions. They have become renowned for their relentlessness and are ruthless warriors who pursue their enemies until every last foe has been slain.[1b] During the Psychic Awakening, the Ordo Xenos requested that the Iron Hounds, Rift Cobras and the Templars of the Covenant Chapters attack the Ork infested Kebban Sub-sector. The Xenos were at war with each other at that time and the Ordo sought their destruction before a Warlord rose to unite the Orks. They also aided the Ultramarines in the Third War for Damnos[1c] and later fought the forces of Nurgle in the Scourge Stars. However, it is now believed the Iron Hounds may have been destroyed, while defending the Imperial worlds located within that blighted region.

Black Leviathan (Novella)	Damocles is an anthology released by the Black Library, a tie-in to Apocalypse, collecting four novellas taking place during the Second Damocles Gulf Crusade. It was later republished as part of the Space Marine Battles novel series. Two centuries ago, the Imperium of Man and the upstart Tau Empire fought to a standstill in the Damocles Gulf. Now, as the 41st millennium draws to a close, the tau have returned. As the world of Agrellan falls under attack, the White Scars and Raven Guard rush to its defence, but with the skilled Commander Shadowsun leading the alien forces, the Space Marines and their allies are hard pressed. Kor'sarro Khan, Huntmaster of the White Scars, swears that he will win the day in the most direct way possible – by taking Shadowsun's head.

Flesh Tearers	The Flesh Tearers are a Second Founding chapter, created when the Blood Angels legion split up after the Horus Heresy in accordance with the Codex Astartes. They suffer from a mutation in their gene-seed, making them far more prone to suffer the Black Rage than other chapters with Blood Angels gene-seed. If no cure is found the chapter is likely to be extinct within the next two millennia. The Flesh Tearers are also ill-famed for their savageness and thirst for blood in battle. The Flesh Tearers Chapter was created in M31 when Roboute Guilliman decreed in his Codex Astartes that no longer should a single individual control the might of an entire Space Marine Legion. Thus, the Blood Angels were divided into several Successor Chapters; one of these being the Flesh Tearers under Chapter Master Nassir Amit. Their reputation for blood-letting quickly spread in the aftermath of the Horus Heresy, indicating that the extensive flaw in their gene-seed was already present at their creation. Instead of checking the rumours of entire populations wiped out, the High Lords of Terra simply looked at the long list of worlds pacified and dismissed the accompanying casualty lists as inconsequential.[Needs Citation] Amit and his followers were still reeling from the death of Sanguinius during the Siege of Terra, and they eventually gave into their resentment and anger. After years as a crusading chapter, Nassir Amit eventually settled the Flesh Tearers on an extremely hostile Death World known as Cretacia. A lost colony of primordial humans proved perfect recruits for the chapter, being pure of taint and extremely strong. Amit became obsessed with Cretacia, believing it to be the manifestation of the Flesh Tearers' own nature, hoping that if he could tame its peaks he could temper the edges of his own fury.
Knights Oceanus	The Knights Oceanus are a Space Marine Chapter. Instead of fighting together, each member of the Knights Oceanus fights as an individual. This extends to the Chapter's culture as well, as their Battle Brothers value their own heraldry over the iconography dictated by the Codex Astartes. While each is unique, they all wear their heraldry over weathered metal power armor, to give them a knightly appearance.

Rhetors	The Rhetors are a Space Marine Chapter.
White Consuls	The White Consuls are a Successor Chapter of the Ultramarines Legion, and are one of the Astartes Praeses Chapters which, according to the ancient tome Mythos Angelica Mortis, were created to guard the Eye of Terror. As one of the Ultramarines successors located farthest from Ultramar, it is rare and a cause for celebration when the White Consuls appear in the court of Marneus Calgar. Unusually the White Consuls have two Chapter Masters; one oversees the defences of the Chapter's home world of Sabatine and commands a standing force ready at a moment’s notice to respond to Chaos incursions through the Cadian Gate, and the other is responsible for the operations of the Chapter's forces in war zones further afield. It is doubtful that this is sanctioned by any entry in the Codex Astartes, and the reason it has never been challenged is the Chapter's homeworld's distance from Ultramar. Also unusually the White Consuls seem to worship the Emperor as a god and seem to be part of the Imperial Cult, unlike most other Astartes Chapters.[5c]
Space Wolves	The Space Wolves (also Sky Warriors of Russ, Rout or Vlka Fenryka or Wolves of Fenris in Fenrisian) were the VI Legion of the twenty Space Marine Legions. Their primarch is Leman Russ, and during the Great Crusade they gained a reputation as the Emperor's executioners and instruments of punishment. After the Horus Heresy and the resultant reforms, the legion was divided, its first and only time, into two chapters: the new Space Wolves chapter retained the name of their parent Legion, while the second chapter took on the name of the Wolf Brothers. The latter however suffered from mutation and were disbanded. The Space Wolves are notorious throughout the rest of the Imperium for their ferocity in battle and their defiance of authority, including the dictates of the Codex Astartes that govern the organisation and combat doctrines of other Space Marine chapters. Fenris is a death world that lies in the galactic north of Segmentum Solar. It is located relatively close to the Eye of Terror. It is also the planet where the mighty Space Wolves recruit their ranks and call home.[8j]
Sanguine Host	The Sanguine Host are a Blood Angels Successor Chapter.
Emperor's Pointy Sticks	The Emperor's Pointy Sticks are a Space Marine Chapter When going to war, the Chapter takes as many vehicles with them as possible, but will use anything at their disposal to fight their enemies. Given the chance though, the Emperor's Pointy Sticks prefer to do their fighting from a distance. The Emperor's Pointy Sticks' are the stars of the Warhammer Community webcomic, Turn Signals on a Land Raider (TSOALR). Their creator Steve Campbell, has also showcased the Chapter on one of the Warhammer Community webpage articles.
Storm Wings	Symbol is a red, lightning-winged skull. The Storm Wings are a Codex Chapter, a Raven Guard Successor Chapter.
Sable Knights	The Sable Knights are a Blood Angels Successor Chapter. The ebon painted onto much of the Fleet Based Chapter's power armour represents their acknowledgement that the Black Rage resides within all of them. Because of this, each of the Sable Knights are determined to make the most of their time before the Black Rage consumes them, and race from war to war. In battle, the Chapter favours armoured spearheads and fleets of transports, as this is the best way for them to engage the enemy as quickly and furiously as possible.

Their primary mission is the safeguarding of the area of Imperial space referred to as the Reef Stars, although they are also known to have contributed forces to wider conflicts, such as the Sabbat Worlds Crusade and the Imperial response to the 13th Black Crusade. The Iron Snakes are a Second Founding Successor Chapter of the Ultramarines. Their founder was Saur Damocles, Captain of the Legion's 6th Company during the Horus Heresy. The current Chapter Master, Seydon, is the eighteenth to bear that title since the foundation of the Chapter.[1a] The first-ever squad-leaders of the Chapter have become immortalized within its ranks, as their names have been retained as the official designation of the squads they first led. Every squad in the Chapter is therefore known by the name of its first commander and careful attention is paid to recording the deeds of each squad and the glory they have accumulated.[Needs Citation] Over the centuries, several squads judged to have accumulated particularly impressive and glorious histories became referred to as "Notable" squads and are seen as the pre-eminent units in the entire Chapter. There are at least five Notable squads within the Iron Snakes: Skypio, Parthus, Veii, Thebes and Damocles. Skypio is the senior squad of the entire chapter and is the closest thing to a Codex First Company the Iron Snakes could be said to have.

Please help to improve this article by fixing those issues as described in the corresponding Help article. Do also note that it is absolutely forbidden to add new information or content to these marked passages as long as the pre-existing citation issues have not been completely resolved. The Raptors are a Successor Chapter of the Raven Guard, created in the Second Founding. They are famous for their exceptional survival abilities, and extremely skilled in guerrilla warfare and infiltration operations. As many records of the Chapter's history are lost, the Raptors' exact origins are unclear. It is generally accepted that the Chapter is descended from the Raven Guard and was one of the first new Space Marine Chapters created during the Second Founding in M31. According to one widely believed theory, the Raptors originated as a Raven Guard Legion company of new initiates training on Deliverance at the time of the Drop Site Massacre.[6a] This company was subsequently sent against the followers of Horus in remote parts of the Galaxy, thus diverging from the rest of the Raven Guard. Having distinguished itself in the civil war, the company was subsequently reorganized as a Chapter amid the reforms initiated by the Codex Astartes. The fledgling Raptors then began their service to the Imperium as a fleet based Chapter hunting down the forces of the Traitor Legions in the Great Scouring.[6a]

Pictorial List of Space Marine Chapters A-L	After the Horus Heresy, the loyal Space Marine Legions were split into smaller Chapters of a thousand Space Marines, in order to prevent any one person from being able to control so many troops ever again. Over time, the number of chapters has grown, and is said to number a thousand. This is a pictorial list of the chapters named by Games Workshop in official texts, and does not include any "home grown" chapters, though it does include the Chaos Marine Legions and Renegade chapters.

Sons of Sanguinius	The Sons of Sanguinius are a Blood Angels Successor Chapter. They were created in the Second Founding,[Conflicting sources] alongside the Flesh Eaters and Blood Drinkers, while the Chapter's Gene-seed was cultured from the Blood Angels' 6th company. The Sons are also noted for being bloodthirsty zealots, who are devoted protectors of Imperial doctrine and they relish the opportunity to kill in their Primarch's name. In fact, the Sons will happily disembowel a child if their Chaplains order them to.[2b] In battle, the Chapter prefers to close with the enemy quickly, making use of jump packs and bikes to accomplish this. As a result of this, most of the Sons' Battle Companies only have two Devastator Squads within their ranks. The Chapter does, however, employ lots of Tactical Squads in battle, as the Chapter favors the slow steady advances they provide their forces with.[2b]
Roboute Guilliman	Roboute Guilliman (/ɹɒbˈuːt ˈɡuːlɪmæn/, rahb•oot gool•ih•man), also known as the Avenging Son, the Victorious, the Master of Ultramar and the Blade of Unity, is one of the genetic "sons" of the Emperor of Mankind, the Primarch of the Ultramarines, his own genetic "sons". An accomplished warlord and diplomat who ruled his own empire before rediscovery by the Emperor, Guilliman was unique among his brother Primarchs in that he saw himself as not only a warrior but also a builder of civilizations. In addition to his leadership of the largest Space Marine Legion during the Great Crusade, Guilliman became renowned for his efforts to preserve the Imperium in the aftermath of the devastating Horus Heresy, becoming Lord Commander of the Imperium. Among his most noteworthy achievements is the authoring of the Codex Astartes and the creation of the modern Imperial military structure.[Needs Citation] Shortly after the Thirteenth Black Crusade Roboute Guilliman was restored from his wounds, and now once again leads the Imperium as its Lord Commander and Imperial Regent, the living voice of the Emperor. Like the other Primarchs, Roboute Guilliman was one of twenty genetically engineered "sons" of the Emperor of Mankind. Like his "brothers," Roboute was taken as an infant by the powers of Chaos, and removed to a far-flung world in an effort to prevent the coming Age of the Imperium. The infant Guilliman's capsule fell to earth on Macragge, where it was discovered by a group of noblemen hunting in the forest. Inside the capsule they found a child, surrounded by a glowing aura. He was taken back to Konor, one of the two Consuls who governed Macragge, who adopted the infant as his son and named him Roboute.[1a] Roboute's arrival on Macragge was a portentous time, and many reported strange sights. Most notably, Konor dreamed of the Emperor, and found himself beside Hera's Falls in the Valley of Laponis. Upon awakening, Konor assembled his bodyguard and rode to Hera's Falls, where they found the child. The name Konor gave the child, Roboute, means "Great One".[Needs Citation] Guilliman would also be raised by Konor's Seneschal, Tarasha Euten, a strong-willed and capable woman.
The Colonel's Monograph (Novella)	The Colonel's Monograph is a Warhammer Horror novella by Graham McNeill. When invited to catalogue the antiquarian book collection of the late Colonel Grayloc — a celebrated hero of the Imperium – former archivist Teresina Sullo is swift to accept. Grieving for her dead husband, she sees an opportunity for distraction and respite from her lonely days as a widow. But something forbidding lurks in the mist-shrouded marshes of Vansen Falls, casting a shadow over Grayloc Manor and veiling the land with ill intent. A missing piece of the colonel's collection holds the answer to this darkness: a monograph rumoured to contain a detailed account of the infamous "Dawn of the Dark Suns". Obsessed with seeking out this singular tome, Teresina delves deeper and deeper into the mystery at the heart of manor, little realising the true evil which resides there...
Ingeniators	The Ingeniators are a Space Marine Chapter. Based on the very northern edge of Imperium Nihilus, their Homeworld, Ingenisus, contains technological marvels and scientists that are known to work toward improving Human technology. This however, has put the Ingeniators' world at odds with both the Imperium and the Adeptus Mechanicus. It is only thanks to the Chapter's exemplary battle records, that Ingenisus' population has so far managed to escape censure for their actions. Their Homeworld also lies close to the territory held by the Leagues of Votann's Conclave of Progress League. However the Ingeniators and the Imperium tolerate the Conclave's presence to some degree, due to the trade the League conducts with Imperial worlds. As a result of this, the Chapter will sometimes allow its forces to accompany and fight beside those of the Conclave of Progress.
Sable Swords	White may be company color The Sable Swords are a Codex Chapter of Space Marines founded in the latter years of M41.[2a] [Conflicting sources] The Sable Swords Chapter was created sometime after 926.M41 following the near-total destruction of the Astral Knights Chapter (the latter having been nearly wiped out stopping the Necron World Engine on the outskirts of the Danorra System). Seven-hundred and seventy-two battle-brothers sacrificed themselves in the suicide mission to silence the World Engine's weapon systems and were instrumental in allowing the Imperial fleet to tear the World Engine apart with repeated volleys of cyclonic torpedoes. The handful of Battle-Brothers who had not been present during the battle against the World Engine were too few to carry the burden of reconstitution. Another Chapter, the Sable Swords, was formed to fill the void and took up stewardship of the all-but abandoned Fortress Monastery.[2d][2f]
Iron Butchers (Chapter)	The Iron Butchers are a Space Marine Chapter.
Rampagers	The Rampagers are a Successor Chapter of the White Scars. Facial scars denote Marines' rank and prestige in the chapter. Marines receive ritual scars in a long ceremony known as Blooding. The gathered blood from this ceremony forms part of the celebration feast that follows. The Rampagers have a habit of claiming Feral Worlds as fresh recruiting grounds, providing the planet's populace test for any forms of corruption.
Excruciators (Chapter)	The Excruciators are a Space Marine Chapter. The people of their Homeworld Motulu, hold immense spiritual significance for their Home System, Gildras. Each of its worlds and features represent an element and serve a deep purpose in Motulu's mythology. These cultural beliefs have been incorporated by the Excruciators as well. They use the Gildras System's various locations in their training and selection processes. During Typhus the Traveler's Charadon Campaign, the Chapter found itself safe-guarding the Gildras System, after it became a safe haven. Numerous refugee ships and space craft of various Imperial forces arrived there and soon the System's resources were overwhelmed. Not helping matters was that the System's worlds, including the Excruciators' Homeworld Motulu, were highly tumultuous and not suitable for the millions of refugees to live upon. This meant the new comers to the Gildras System were forced to live upon their ships and as supplies became scarce, order began to break down. This led the Excruciators to destroy several troop transports and Imperial Navy ships that threatened the Imperium's hold on the System.
Storm Reapers	The Storm Reapers are a White Scars Successor Chapter. The Storm Reapers were among the Chapters created during the Ultima Founding at the direct order of Lord Commander Roboute Guilliman. Consisting primarily of Primaris Space Marines, these Chapters are intended to reinforce the Imperial war effort in the Indomitus Crusade. The Storm Reapers were the first Primaris Chapter made from White Scars gene-seed. Embodying Jaghatai Khan's wise and noble but vicious nature, they have claimed the Feral World of Jagun as their homeworld.
Steel Confessors	The Steel Confessors are a Space Marine Chapter. There is not much verifiable information on the Steel Confessors Space Marines Chapter (see Notes below). They are however referred to as the "crippled Steel Confessors Chapter" and Talos Valcoran, the Soulhunter, had taken a salvaged replacement thigh guard for his own damaged Power armour from a Steel Confessors armour. The whole Steel Confessors Chapter fought a battle against the Tyranids of Hive Fleet Leviathan on the world of Kalevala. This planet is the "home" to the Gene Seed of the Steel Confessors. Kalevala also hosts a Psychic Choir designed to boost the signal of the Astronomican to allow Imperial shipping to continue navigating through the psychic miasma of the Tyranid Hive Fleets. On the planet surface there is a vast Manufactorum that the Space Marines are honour-pledged to defend.
Lords of Wrath	The Lords of Wrath are a Space Marine Chapter. The Lords of Wrath were known to still use the rank of Lieutenant in their Chapter in M41. In 995.M41, Lieutenant Hesprix led a taskforce of the Chapter in pursuit of Decius Mus, the Arch-Heretic of Auscum, who had fled with his forces to the Xenthorp System. With the aid of the 23rd Bruttiam Imperial Guard Regiment, which was garrisoned in the system, Hesprix's taskforce was able to capture Mus.
Sons of Guilliman	The Sons of Guilliman are a Successor Chapter of the Ultramarines.[3a] Hailing from the desert-ringed Death World of Praesidia, the Chapter has a dark past. Whispers persist that more than one of its members has fallen to Chaos and that the Chapter has a reputation for rash and codex-divergent behaviour. This reputation however sees them fight all the harder to prove themselves worthy of their name. Sons of Guilliman Firstborn
Hammers of Nocturne	The Hammers of Nocturne are a Salamanders Successor Chapter, that was created during the Ultima Founding. They were among the Salamanders' newly created Successors, who honoured their Founding Chapter by aiding in the search for the Artefacts of Vulkan. In the Hammers of Nocturne's case, they deployed multiple Companies to take part in the effort. Hammers of Nocturne forces were present alongside Vulkan He'stan as he journeyed towards the world known only as Zero.
Imperial Armour - Apocalypse II	Imperial Armour - Apocalypse II is a book released 2009 and produced by Forge World for the 1st Edition of the Apocalypse rulset. Imperial Navy Space Marines
Celestial Lions	The Celestial Lions are a Space Marine Chapter created in the 38th millennium. They have a long and glorious history. Recently the Chapter has come into conflict with elements of the Inquisition, with terrible consequences. The Celestial Lions were created in the 38th Millennium from the Gene-Seed of the Imperial Fists. Alongside the Emperor's Spears and Star Scorpions they were one of the three chapters assigned to guard Elara's Veil. During the event known as the Khattarn Insurrection, five companies of the Celestial Lions were attached to Inquisitor Apollyon in order to crush the ongoing revolt on the main planet, Khattar. The orbital defences were nothing to the Space Marines and they quickly landed on the planet, with virtually no opposition. As the campaign progressed and the number of prisoners increased, it became evident that this was no mere minor rebellion. Apparently the priesthood of Khattar had been corrupted and had led the leaders of the planet into the arms of Slaanesh. Local renegade Imperial Guard and Planetary Defence Force regiments were quickly defeated and within three months the rebellion was crushed. The detachment of the Celestial Lions boarded into their ships and left for their fortress monastery.[3e]
Sanguine Knights	The Sanguine Knights are a Blood Angels Successor Chapter. Their Company and squad markings were inspired by the Blood Angels. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view.

Inculcators	The Inculcators are a Space Marine Chapter.
Claws of Lorek	The Chaos Space Marine warband known as the Claws of Lorek have been sighted within the area of the Maelstrom, and are noted as a possible splinter group of the renegade Astral Claws. They use a reverse of the Astral Claws' tiger-stripe pattern. The Claws of Lorek, led by Neshan Voor, were members of the Bloodborn army which took part in the Invasion of Ultramar led by Warsmith Honsou and the Daemon Prince M'kar in 999.M41.[2a][2b][2c]
Astral Claws	The Astral Claws were a Space Marine Chapter who turned Renegade in M41. Their survivors exist as the Red Corsairs, and their Chapter Master, Lugft Huron, is now the infamous pirate lord Huron Blackheart. The Astral Claws were founded during the mid-35th millennium as a Crusading Chapter in order to help stabilize the slowly crumbling Imperium during the Nova Terra Interregnum. Their founding chapter is unknown, as most records of their existence have been destroyed in an Edict of Obliteration, though speculation on their gene-seed stability and combat tactics point towards either the Ultramarines or the Dark Angels.[1a] Before their downfall the Astral Claws possessed a roll of battle-honours that would be the envy of many; after their performance in the Fifth Black Crusade, their Chapter Standard was placed in the halls of the Eternity Gate in the Imperial Palace on Terra.[1a]
Realm of Chaos	Realm of Chaos was a two-part series of books; the first published in 1988, the second in 1990. The books are part of Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader (First Edition). The works discuss the four deities of Chaos and the various aspects of Chaos and the Warp. The books were designed for both Warhammer 40,000 and Warhammer Fantasy. This information has since been superseded, but still forms the basis for later background in Third and Fourth Editions, inspiring the Horus Heresy novels and the Liber Chaotica set of books. Slaves to Darkness discusses the nature of Khorne and Slaanesh. The Lost and the Damned was its companion book, dealing with Nurgle and Tzeentch. Articles that compile information contained within the Realm of Chaos books:
Invictors	The Invictors were a Space Marine Chapter of a Later Founding. They were corrupted during the Abyssal Crusade and became The Unhallowed. After their fall to Chaos, the Unhallowed at least once cooperated with the Warp Ghosts.

Children of Purgatos	The Children of Purgatos are a Chaos Space Marine warband.
Disciples of Destruction	The Disciples of Destruction are a Chaos Space Marine warband. They were first sighted in 988.M41.
Grey Slayers	The Grey Slayers were a Space Marine Chapter which was corrupted by Chaos. Their downfall began when the Feral World, the Grey Slayers recruited their Aspirants from began worshiping unclean powers. This allowed the corruption to spread throughout the Chapter and the Grey Slayers eventually became corrupted by Chaos. The Ordo Malleus Inquisitor Ordinary Gerome Thrax discovered their fate and he led the Grey Knights in an attack to purge the Grey Slayers. Their Chapter Master took his own life during the attack, which saw the degenerate Grey Slayers destroyed. However, Inquisitor Thrax became possessed by a Daemon as he searched for the origin of the Chapter's corruption and he was subsequently slain by the Grey Knights as well.
Ghorstangrad	Ghorstangrad was the homeworld of the Emperor's Swords Chapter. After three centuries of careful infiltration and subversion by the Alpha Legion, the traitor marines launched an invasion of the world in conjunction with a psychic attack that activated corrupted Battle-Brothers within. As the Emperor's Swords were destroyed, Ghorstangrad was razed.
Brothers of Darkness	The Brothers of Darkness are a Chaos Space Marine warband. They still rule over the homeworld that was theirs before they turned against the Imperium.
Betrayers of Pain	The Betrayers of Pain are a Chaos Space Marine warband.
Beasts of Annihilation	The Beasts of Annihilation are a Chaos Space Marine warband. These warriors are devout followers of the Dark Gods and frequently allow creatures of the Warp to inhabit their bodies. As such the Beasts of Annihilation field an unusually large number of Possessed squads. Originally known as the Annihilators, the Chapter finally succumbed to complete insanity during the anti-xenos genocidal Quietus Campaign. Those of the chapter still able to act rationally gathered at their Fortress-Monastery in the hope of finding absolution, but instead their corrupted Chaplains led them into a ritual of Daemonic possession. Every member of the Chapter was possessed over the course of a single night. Afterwards, they called themselves the Beasts of Annihilation. They are known to have taken part in the Charadon Campaign.
Blood Disciples	The Blood Disciples are a Khornate Chaos Space Marines Warband who were originally the 8th Company of the Emperor's Wolves Chapter. In 888.M37, the Emperor's Tarot indicated a great Chaos threat from the worlds of the Eye of Terror named Goreworlds. The 8th Company of the Emperor's Wolves was dispatched to deal with the threat, encountering a twisted hermit known as the Red Prophet. Slaying the heretical preacher, all those touched by his blood instantly became devoted to Khorne. Eventually the entire Company was exposed and they renamed themselves the Blood Disciples. Decades later, they returned to realspace dedicated to the powers of Chaos and have launched raids into Segmentum Obscurus ever since. Because of the Warband's history as a designated assault company, the Blood Disciples are noted for having a large number of Chaos Raptors.
Extinction Angels	The Extinction Angels are a Space Marine Chapter that turned to Chaos. During the 13th Black Crusade the chapter fought alongside the Black Legion on the planet Demios Primary, where they scattered the Skitarii forces who were protecting the many forges of the Adeptus Mechanicus. The planet was liberated by the Black Templars and it is believed that the Angels are still hidden in the lower depths. The most veteran and skilled warriors of the Extinction Angels are known as The Reapers. They have become masters of melee combat, particularly working in conjunction against hardened targets. Reapers attack in packs, skillfully overwhelming larger prey.
Brotherhood of Darkness	The Brotherhood of Darkness are a Chaos Space Marine warband. They took part in the Quabbalis Heresy in M40. Ships belonging to the Brotherhood of Darkness are known to have ambushed a convey of cargo vessels and transport and civilian passenger crafts in the Pandraxx Subsector in 003.998.M41. The convey was completely destroyed with no Imperial survivors. At an unknown point after the Horus Heresy the Brotherhood of Darkness assaulted an Imperial Astropathic Relay Station near the Eye of Terror, alongside Ahzek Ahriman during his exile from the Thousand Sons. They burned the Astropaths alive and massacred the civilians aboard.
Knights of Blood (Warband)	The Knights of Blood are a Khornate Chaos Space Marine warband. The Knights of Blood are known to have committed massacres on Cadon, Obsus Prima and Helka II. In 999.M41, the Knights of Blood attacked Ornsworld and wiped out over ninety percent of the population. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Bellicas	Bellicas was the homeworld of the Emperor's Swords Space Marine Chapter until it was wiped out by Necrons. In 990.M41, a hidden Necron tomb deep beneath the planet's surface awoke, resulting in a vicious battle that saw the Emperor's Swords wiped out to the last Battle Brother. However, shortly after, the Fire Lords Chapter arrived and exterminated the Necrons, avenging their fallen brothers.
Company of Misery	The Company of Misery are a renegade Chaos Space Marine warband. They were first encountered on Maddean IV in M37. Previously known as the Desolate Brotherhood, since the degradation of their gene-seed stocks in M32 they were assigned to impossibly dangerous and undesirable duties such as being stationed on Death Worlds, Space Hulks, and Quarantined Worlds. Each time they thought they had won reprieve, only to be sent on an even more hazardous mission. Spiraling into dissolution and despair, they finally converted to Chaos in the acidic swamps of misery. They changed their name and have since become a sworn enemy of the Imperium. Records about them bring them in connection with the terms Brethren of Mysery.
Dark Tusks	The Dark Tusks are a Chaos Space Marine warband who operate as mercenaries in the Reef Stars. Evidence suggests the Dark Tusks are followers of Nurgle, but they were encountered, by Damocles Squad of the Iron Snakes, fighting alongside a Tzeentchian cult on Rosetta. They wore corroded, rotten black armour and smelled diseased. They also carried an array of daemon weapons and "Plague Weapons". Unlike the majority of Dark Tusks, the leader wore "shiny black" armor with chains looped about him. The Dark Tusks are described as bestial, and acting like animals when cornered by the Iron Snakes.
Ordo Malleus	The Ordo Malleus (literally meaning Order of the Hammer in Low Gothic) is one of the three major Ordos of the Inquisition. Based on the moons of Saturn it is tasked with the responsibility of investigating and destroying the physical manifestations of Chaos throughout the Imperium. Known colloquially as Daemonhunters, the members of the Ordo Malleus are individuals of great strength of will, able to face the agents of Chaos without flinching. Due to the highly secretive nature of its mission and the great mental strength required to combat the forces of Chaos, the Ordo Malleus is by far the smallest major Order of the Inquisition. However, the strength of the inquisitors of the Ordo is bolstered by their Chamber Militant, the Grey Knights.[Needs Citation] The Ordo Malleus is considered one of the oldest and most ancient arms of the Inquisition that was created by the decree of the Emperor prior to his internment and ascension to the Golden Throne of Terra. It was originally established to police the thoughts and deeds of the Imperium itself which meant it was charged with the purity of other Inquisitors.[2b] In the hours following the defeat of Warmaster Horus, and understanding the severity of his own wounds, the Emperor believed that others must fill his role guarding humanity from the Warp, to thwart the designs of the Chaos Gods. [Needs Citation]
Ordo Xenos	"Compassion is reserved for servants of the Emperor: aliens deserve only our scorn."- Inquisitor Czevak, Teachings on the Unholy. The Ordo Xenos is one of the three major Ordos of the Inquisition, dedicated to countering the threat of alien species. Their military arm is the Deathwatch. Armed with the best human and xenos technology known, extremely knowledgeable about their foe, unflinching in their mission, the Ordo Xenos can respond to any possible xenos threat. Their tactics vary depending heavily on the situation, species of xenos involved, and level of xenos influence on the local population. Where the threat is subtle they will use guile and stealth, wielding their power as a scalpel is used to cut out a cancerous growth. When the alien menace is great, the Inquisitor can enlist the aid of entire regiments of Imperial Guard and Space Marines. When the threat is too great for even these to handle, the Inquisitor will call on the elite battle-brothers of the Deathwatch. In extreme cases, entire planets are known to be destroyed through Exterminatus. Because of its historical involvement in mass xenocide, the Ordo Xenos has the most blood on its hands of any other Ordo within the Inquisition.
Crimson Slaughter	The Crimson Slaughter are a Chaos Space Marine Warband. Formerly a loyalist Space Marine Chapter known as the Crimson Sabres, the Crimson Slaughter were declared to be a Renegade Chapter in M41 following signs of psychological instability and overly-zealous activities during their campaigns. They were ultimately excommunicated from the Imperium after the events on the world of Umidia. There, they purged the planet's entire population after coming under the belief that they had been tainted by the Ruinous Powers. However subsequent intelligence indicated that Chaos Cults on the planet were indeed in the process of summoning a powerful Daemon of Khorne. Khorne, either as a reward or revenge for massacring his followers, cursed the Crimson Sabres to be haunted by the voices of all those they killed. Only further bloodshed could silence the voices, and even that was temporary. Thus the Chapter Master Sevastus Kranon led his followers into the Eye of Terror to gain a temporary peace among the realm of Chaos rather than remain in Imperial space and risk harming further innocents. The renegades who call themselves the Crimson Slaughter were once the Crimson Sabres Chapter of Space Marines. It is unknown from which founding the Crimson Sabres were created, or which Chapter served as their progenitor. The earliest mentions of the Crimson Sabres that have been have been uncovered are battle records that list them as participating in campaigns at the dawning of the 36th Millennium. That the Chapter’s founding is unknown seems tied to two events – the Amalgamation Schism and the destruction of the planet Rhoghon.[6a]
The Damned Company of Lord Caustos	A group of Space Marines called the Damned Company of Lord Caustos turned to Chaos after they were declared traitors by an Inquisitor of the Ordo Hereticus, based on some flimsy and circumstantial evidence. Although they only turned to Chaos to survive in a galaxy hostile to them, they now live their lives as mercenaries.
Brotherhood of Blood	The Brotherhood of Blood are a Chaos Space Marine warband active in the Eye of Terror. The Brotherhood of Blood have battled the Iron Warriors, Black Legion, Death Guard, Night Lords, and Sons of Hate for the Fortress World close to the Cadian Gate, Brigannion Four.
Fire Reavers	The Fire Reavers are a Chaos Warband.[1a] They were once a Space Marine Chapter and are still based out of the Homeworld, that was given to them by the Imperium[1a]. Now, though, the Fire Reavers are considered to be among the most fanatical Warbands, in their devotion to the Chaos Gods, alongside the likes of the Brothers of Livos and those of the Word Bearers. Because of this, the Fire Reavers view becoming a Possessed Chaos Space Marine as a great honor and believe that the Possessed are superior to Chaos Space Marines. Those of the Warband who attempt to become one of the Possessed, do so in mass ceremonies that are greatly celebrated by the Fire Reavers.[1b]
Hakanor's Reavers	Hakanor's Reavers are a group of Chaos Space Marines under the leadership of Hakanor, a Daemon Prince formerly known as the Chapter Master Prometian. The armour of these warriors burns with a magical heat, causing it to constantly crack and reform like lava. A small band of Reavers assisted a Chaos cult in entrapping and destroying a reinforcement detail from the Armageddon Steel Legion, on Aionos, approximately one hundred years before the Second Armageddon War. They were lured into the passageways of a buried Necron Monolith and wiped out by its inhabitants.
The Cleaved	The Cleaved are a warband of Chaos Space Marines. Oil-like blood constantly oozes from the joints in their power armour. These marines are known to have a high threshold for pain. First appearing during the insurrection on the planet Magma Cordelian, the loyalist Guardsmen of the Iridian 334th Regiment had pushed their way into the rebellious Planetary Governor's palace after a sustained artillery bombardment. However, the regiment's unit of Primaris Psykers realized that the architecture of the palace was actually a gigantic summoning circle. Into the fray were summoned the Cleaved, who massacred the Iridian guardsmen and secured the planet for the traitors.
Renegade chapters	This is a list of all known Renegade Space Marine Chapters and Warbands that are considered renegades against the Imperium for reasons other than Chaos worship. In the 10,000 years since their creation, many Space Marines have been declared as renegades from the Imperium. By far the most infamous and numerous of these are the Chaos Space Marines, but there are some forces who are considered renegades against the Imperium for reasons other than the worship of Chaos (although it should be noted that many such Chapters later succumbed to worship of the Ruinous Powers). It should be noted that some Chapters have changed their names during their history and may be represented on this list more than once under different titles.
Jackalan Echoes	The Jackalan Echoes are a Crimson Slaughter Warband.
Alpha Legion	"Our name is Legion, for we are many." The Alpha Legion, also known as the Ghost Legion during the early Great Crusade, is the XX Legion of the original twenty Space Marine Legions. They turned against the Emperor during the Horus Heresy, becoming Chaos Space Marines.[1d] Even before they turned to Chaos, the Alpha Legion were renowned as the most secretive of all the Legions.[1a] The Alpha Legion's most closely guarded secret, unbeknownst to all but a few outside the Legion, is that they had two primarchs; Alpharius and his twin Omegon (sometimes referred to collectively as just 'Alpharius Omegon').[2h] The Alpha Legion's veterans are experts in infiltration, covert operations, and manipulating events in their favour without revealing themselves or engaging in open warfare. Alpha Legionaries have been known to disguise themselves as loyalist Space Marines. Their armies also contain regular Humans known as Operatives.[1a]
Flawless Host, The	The Flawless Host are a Chaos Space Marine warband. Autopsies made on the corpses of slain warriors have confirmed that the Flawless Host uses an extreme amount of combat stimulants in battle. The warband tends to not just raid but conquer planets, where they proceed to enforce their twisted view of beauty. The Flawless Host was originally known as the Shining Blades. From a gene-seed once considered free from taint, they were known for their purity and rigid mental training. Their reputation and string of victories produced a great hubris, believing they could never be defeated. This led to the Berillia Massacre in 498.M34, in which they slaughtered all they came across in a frenzy of indignation after their magnificence was supposedly questioned. Becoming overwhelmed by Slaanesh and renaming themselves the Flawless Host, they have been a plague to the Imperium ever since. The Flawless Host is known to have taken part in the 5th Black Crusade, devastating the agri worlds of Galvan II and Galvan IV during this conflict. The warband also temporarily conquered several Imperial worlds throughout the centuries, including Vilidad Prime, Laudamus, and Sendennis.
Bleak Brotherhood	The Bleak Brotherhood are a Chaos Space Marine warband. Their noisome forces garrisoned the "widowmaker" bastion gate on Lycanthos Secundus that was successfully captured by Lugft Huron during the Lycanthos Drift Campaign in 780.M41. They survived this defeat, however, and were last encountered at the Cadian Gate. The Bleak Brotherhood has been described as a possible faction of the Warp Ghosts, though this belief is probably mistaken. The Warp Ghosts are known as ferrymen and mercenaries, and they are often confused with their temporary employers. It is most likely that the Bleak Brotherhood only hired the Warp Ghosts on at least one occasion, leading Imperials to consider a deeper connection.
Necrons	The Necrons are a race of mechanical warriors, created from the Necrontyr. They have lain dormant in their stasis-tombs for sixty million years.[8a] They are ancient beyond reckoning, pre-dating even the Eldar. At long last, however, they are beginning to awaken, seeking to reestablish the supremacy of the Necron Dynasties over the Galaxy once more.[4a] The domain of the Necrons is known to themselves as the Infinite Empire[17a] or Necron Star Empire.[58b] Currently, the conquered territories of the Necrons equals about a quarter of that of the spatial extent of the Imperium.[58a] There are primitive artworks and tribal mythologies that speak of a xenos civilisation[18a] that existed billions of years before humans originated on Terra.[4b][39a][45a] This ancient race was known as the Necrontyr.[1a][4b][18a][39a] They lived precariously, facing solar winds and radiation storms[4b][39a] that kept their lives constantly afflicted by sickness and loss.[1a][4b][39a] Their cities were built with their short life-spans in mind, as their ancestral tomb complexes greatly outnumbered the living, which were considered little more than temporal residents.[1a][4b][39a] Despite their wondrous technologies,[18a] the Necrontyr had not been able to conquer their hereditary biological weakness.[1a] They also desperately sought to conquer other planets with less hostile environments, and eventually their Dynasties held control over a great part of the galaxy.[1a][4b][39a] It was during their military campaigns that the Necrontyr first came into contact with the Old Ones—one of the first sentient races.[1a] As their empire expanded and grew more diverse, tensions between the Dynasties threatened their unity.[4b] Rebellions known as the First Wars of Secession erupted as entire realms fought for independence.[4b][4c] The Triarch—the ruling council of Necrontyr—realised that only the threat of an external enemy would bring unity once more and saw the Old Ones as the perfect subjects for the wrath of their race. Already jealous of the Old Ones' seemingly eternal life spans,[1a][39a] the Necrontyr initiated hostilities: the separatists abandoned their rebellion, and the War in Heaven began.[4b]
Horus Heresy	I am Horus, forged of the Oldest Gods, I am he who gave way to Khaos. I am that great destroyer of all. I am he who did what seemed good to him, And set doom in the palace of my will. Mine is the fate of those who move along this serpentine path The Horus Heresy, also known as the Age of Darkness, was the first and most devastating galaxy-spanning civil war in Imperial history. Occurring in early M31 and lasting several years, it divided and nearly destroyed the fledgling Imperium of Man. It marked the end of the Great Crusade and the encasing of the Emperor of Mankind into the Golden Throne. Though the Heresy was ignited by the product of a conspiracy by the forces of Chaos, there were precipitating factors that helped push many of the Legio Astartes towards rebellion. The first was the Emperor's return to and seclusion on Terra, working on a secret project that he refused to share with any of his Primarchs, including his most favored son Horus, whom he had named Warmaster. This apparent abandonment of the Great Crusade, for something he would not even share with his sons bred mistrust, resentment, and disappointment towards the Emperor amongst many of the Primarchs.[2a]
Dragon Warriors	The Dragon Warriors are a Chaos Space Marine warband. They specialise in short-range firefights, preferring the use of Melta and Flame Weapons. They are among the archenemies of the Salamanders, and have attempted to attack their homeworld in the past.

The Emperor's Children were the III Legion of the twenty original Space Marine Legions, also known after their fall as the Lords of Profligacy.[12b] Their Primarch is Fulgrim. One of the nine legions that betrayed the Emperor during the Horus Heresy, they became Chaos Space Marines. They worship the Chaos god Slaanesh and are hedonistic psychopaths who live for experiences of excess. The earliest recruits to the Emperor's Children, then known as III Legion, were recruits gathered from Europa during the Unification Wars. Noble houses, such as House Loculus of Komarg, selected the finest of their youth and gave them to the Emperor following their defeat by his Thunder Warriors as tribute for their previous defiance. Following the Houses of Europa's lead, other noble Terran dynasties also sent their children to fight in the III Legion. This was rumoured to be the source of the Legion's adopted name, the Emperor's Children, a name that was re-affirmed later following Fulgrim's rediscovery.[11a]
Deathmongers	The Deathmongers (or Death Mongers) are a Chaos Space Marine warband. They revere wanton destruction over victory in their campaigns. Originally known as the Brothers of the Anvil, they were among the thirty Chapters whose homeworld lay in the path of the Warp Storm Dionys that appeared in M37. In Dionys wake did the levels of mutation and cultist activity rose dramatically and the Chapters caught in it had their gene-seed corrupted. When the powerful and influential Saint Basillius heard of this, he declared all those Chapters whose homeworlds had become corrupted to be rendered into his judgement. Such was his influence that the High Lords of Terra agreed to the decision, and 30 chapters were found to be corrupted. Basillius ordered that the 30 Chapters take part in the Abyssal Crusade into the Eye of Terror, and one by one the Chapters solemnly undertook their quest of certain doom in 321.M37. During the campaign they scoured the world of Belial IV in the Eye of Terror, a world blighted by the ruins of the former Eldar empire. However they were captured by Dark Eldar raiders plundering the planet for lost artefacts. Spending a year in the nightmarish arenas of Commorragh, the survivors of the chapter managed to escape from the Dark City back into the Materium. However, now driven insane by their experience, they became the Chaos Space Marine warband known as the Deathmongers. Since then they have waged a war of brutal destruction against the Imperium.
Angels of Ecstasy	The Angels of Ecstasy are a Chaos Space Marine warband. They were originally known as the Sons of Ulthunas and turned renegade during the Ganymethian Betrayal. Their Chaos dedication is unclear although their name and colour scheme implies Slaanesh worship.
Chaos Warband	In the 10,000 years since their creation, many Space Marines have betrayed the Emperor and turned to worship of the Chaos Gods. This is a list of all known Chaos Space Marine Legions, Chapters and Warbands. It should be noted that some Chapters have changed their names during their history and may be represented on this list more than once under different titles. Codex: Chaos Space Marines (4th Edition), pg. 18
Apocalypse Company	The Apocalypse Company are a Chaos Space Marine warband. They are a possible Warp Ghosts faction. Last sighting: Cadian Gate
Iron Warriors	The Iron Warriors were the IV Legion of the twenty original Space Marine Legions, sons of the Primarch Perturabo. They were one of the nine legions which betrayed the Emperor during the Horus Heresy, becoming Chaos Space Marines.[1a] Their specialty is siege warfare and the reduction of fortified positions, which made them natural rivals of the Imperial Fists even before the Heresy.[1a][1c] The Iron Warriors are also fierce close-range fighters, witnesses comparing their ferocity to the berserkers of the World Eaters traitor legion or the loyalist Blood Angels.[1d] They make common use of slave-soldiers as cannon fodder to wither the ammunition supplies of the besieged and to locate the positions of enemy gun emplacements.[1f] Like the Iron Hands they used bionics often to replace mutated limbs, as they hated all forms of mutation.[22a] Originally created as the IVth Legion, the Legion was founded atop the wreckage of a recidivist fortress on the Terran Auro Plateau of Sek-Amrak. The warlike gun-tribes in the surrounding areas made up the first of the Legion's Marines. The early IVth Legion proved itself in the Unification Wars, making its domain one of the most stalwart bastions of the Emperor. The Legion's gene-seed showed above average adaptability and a below average resistance rate to Bionics. This allowed the Legion to be one of the largest and the earliest deployed alongside the I Legion and V Legion.[20a]
Death Guard	This article contains text passages or images with citation issues. The concerned content is marked with "Citation issue" tags. Please help to improve this article by fixing those issues as described in the corresponding Help article. Do also note that it is absolutely forbidden to add new information or content to these marked passages as long as the pre-existing citation issues have not been completely resolved. The Death Guard, formerly known as the Dusk Raiders and known amongst themselves as the Unbroken,[26a] were the XIV Legion of the original twenty Space Marine Legions. Their Primarch is Mortarion, who relocated their base to his homeworld of Barbarus after his discovery by the Emperor. During the Horus Heresy, Mortarion and the majority of the Legion swore allegiance to Horus, becoming one of the nine Traitor Legions who betrayed the Emperor. After Barbarus was destroyed during the Heresy, they relocated to Munificence inside the Eye of Terror. Because of Barbarus's toxic environment, the Death Guard took great pride in their resistance to poisons, disease, and mortality in general. This fascination led them to worship the Chaos God Nurgle and in return he infests their armour with pestilence and disease, and elevated Mortarion to a Daemon Prince.
Luna Wolves	Worship of Horus as a god[13b] The Sons of Horus, originally known as the Luna Wolves, were the XVI Legion of the original twenty Space Marine Legions. Their Primarch was Horus, known to them as Horus Lupercal, and to Imperial history as the instigator of the Horus Heresy, the first great Imperial civil war. Following the Horus Heresy most of the Sons of Horus escaped into the Eye of Terror, where they were largely shattered during the Legion Wars. Following the Battle of Harmony large amounts of the Legion were later absorbed into former First Captain Ezekyle Abaddon's Black Legion. A few warbands, later known as the "Thrice-Cursed Traitors‎", were able to remain independent and still operate as Sons of Horus.[13b] The Luna Wolves are said to have originated from a world called Cthonia; this planet allegedly existed in one of Terra's closest neighbouring star systems. Being within reach even for non-warp spacecraft, Cthonia had been colonised, built upon, tunneled and mined out most likely since the dawn of space travel. As such, all natural resources had been stripped away and used up millennia before the arrival of the Primarch Horus Lupercal, and the ancient mining technology had long since been rediscovered and removed by the Adepts of Mars. The planet that remained was largely redundant and abandoned, completely riddled with catacombs, crumbling industrial plants and exhausted mine-workings. It is noted as no longer extant in current Imperial records, believed to have cataclysmically lost geo-structural integrity in the centuries after the Horus Heresy. Many put this down to the fact that the planet was tunneled and mined right though to the (dead) planetary core, but there is much conjecture that Cthonia was deliberately destroyed, by person or persons unknown.
Death Shadows	The Death Shadows were a Chaos Space Marine warband specialised in sabotage and terror tactics. The Death Shadows were originally a Loyalist Space Marine Chapter known as the Lionguard and were among the thirty Chapters corrupted during the Abyssal Crusade. After a disastrous war against Ultramar, the Death Shadows withdrew to their secret stronghold on the Fortress World of Sybari. In 745.M41, while they were planning a strike against Macragge, tendrils of Hive Fleet Behemoth rampaged into Sybari and devoured it. Elements of the Death Shadows were not present at Sybari by the time of its destruction, and some of these later aided the Bloodborn in their invasion of Ultramar.
Black Legion	"Butcher your enemies without mercy. Crush his armies and leave none alive. But do not stop there. Burn his cities. Bomb his world from orbit. Slaughter everything and everyone until he kneels in the ashes of those he sought to protect. Only then will he understand the true fury of the Dark Gods. " The Black Legion is the current largest warband of Chaos Space Marines. Formed after the defeat of the Sons of Horus in the Horus Heresy, the Legion was founded by former Sons of Horus First Captain Ezekyle Abaddon near the conclusion of the Legion Wars. It includes a substantial portion of the former Sons of Horus alongside Traitor Astartes from all walks of life. The Black Legion sees itself not as the successor of Horus and his Legion, but as a new army to continue the Long War and succeed where he failed.[35b] The Black Legion can be found operating in countless small warbands across the galaxy, except when they are called together under Abaddon's banner to spearhead one of his notorious Black Crusades.
Angels of Flame	The Angels of Flame are a Chaos Space Marine chapter. As of 999.M41 they are the most recent chapter to fall to Chaos. The Angels of Flame apparently turned traitor during an extended mission of reconquest at the edge of the galaxy near the Ghoul Stars.
Knights of Blood (Chapter)	A Successor Chapter to the Blood Angels, the Knights of Blood were a Renegade Space Marine Chapter. Although their frenzied warriors were dangerous to both friend and foe alike, they still purged the galaxy of the Imperium's enemies.[1a] They have since been largely destroyed and are now a Lost Chapter. The Knights of Blood Chapter suffered from the Black Rage and the Red Thirst, like the Blood Angels and their Successor Chapters and this ultimately proved to be their downfall. After the number of their Battle Brothers falling to the Chapter's Gene-seed curses, constantly increased. In their desperation to stop this, the Knights of Blood gave into the Red Thirst and by feasting on the blood of the innocent, the Chapter was able to stop their decline. While this helped for awhile, it damned the Knights of Blood in the end, as their consumption of blood caused them to begin physically mutating. The Chapter soon developed red skin, yellow eyes and sharp elongated teeth that crowded their mouths. After the transformation was done, the Knights learned they now looked similar to the heavily corrupted Blood Angels, kept in the Tower of Amareo on Baal and that only feasting on blood kept the Black Rage from consuming them. Knowing that that they would be exterminated if their condition was discovered, the Knights decided that from then on they would only fight alone. No more would the Chapter fight beside other Imperials, including any of the Sanguinary Brotherhood.[5b] The Knights started a galactic crusade to purge the foes of the Imperium, but committed so many excesses in the course of it that they were declared renegades by the High Lords of Terra in the beginning of M41[Needs Citation]. As such they kept their distance from any allies, to protect those allies from both the Inquisition and their own deficiencies. Some chapters ignore this decree, refusing to accept any declaration of renegade status from any other than a Space Marine, but other chapters are extremely zealous in prosecuting outcasts. There have been rumors of the presence of the Knights of Blood operating in the Jericho Reach for several years, but they have never appeared on any officially sanctioned order of battle, and as far as can be ascertained, no communications have been exchanged between them and the Achilus Crusade's high command.
Lords of Decay	The Lords of Decay are a Chaos Space Marine warband dedicated to the Chaos God Nurgle. Formerly a Loyalist Space Marine Chapter known as the Lances of Pteros, they were one of the thirty Chapters sentenced to the Abyssal Crusade on the orders of Saint Basillius. The Lords of Decay are a large Death Guard sub-faction. They have been encountered by Imperial forces on multiple occasions, including during the Siege of Vraks. They are stated as having been formerly led by the Primarch Mortarion.[Conflicting sources] They are currently being pursued by Imperial forces in the Mentieth Sector.
Chaos Gods	The Chaos Gods, also called the Dark Gods or the Ruinous Powers, are powerful beings of the psychic universe known as the Warp, created and sustained by the emotions and souls of every living being of the material universe. Although they are god-like beings, they are by their nature monomaniacal and completely single-minded (formed completely of a single emotion or concept) as well as being completely dependent on the emotions of mortal creatures for their power and continued existence.[1a] Gods are able to devote a fraction of their power to create daemons, whose appearance and character reflect the god's own nature. These daemons may be reabsorbed into the god at whim. The least of the minor gods may be so limited in their power that expending their power to create a daemon means their entire power is expended; in effect, the god becomes a daemon.[1a] In the early history of the Galaxy, the powers of the Warp had yet to form into distinct entities. At this time, the emotions of mortals flowed and ebbed as water does in a stream. As the mortal races grew and prospered, so did the strength of their emotions. Eventually, the gods grew to such a point where they could act independently of the general flow of emotions and thus became the Gods of Chaos. They reached into the dreams of mortals and demanded praise and servitude in order to increase their own power, as the more one emotion is exhibited (in both thought and action) the stronger that god becomes.[1a] The first three gods, Khorne, Tzeentch, and Nurgle, became sapient by the end of M2, but Slaanesh didn't fully awaken until the Fall of the Eldar in M29.
Axes of the Forge	The Axes of the Forge are a Fleet Based World Eaters Warband. They maintain a symbiotic relationship with the Khorne Thralls of the Eightfold Cog Dark Mechanicum Cult, which has been beneficial for both sides. The Warband for their part protects the Eightfold Cog and provides the Cult with technological spoils and slaves from the Axes' raids. The Eightfold in return provides the Warband with ammunition, equipment, repairs, modifications and sacrifices the slaves in their creation of Khorne Daemon Engines. These Engines are then given to the Warband or kept by the Eightfold, who are always of need of more slaves to create additional Daemon Engines. This has resulted in the Axes launching countless slave raids in order to find worthy souls for the Cult to sacrifice to the Blood God. The Eightfold are also aided in the creation of the Daemon Engines by their enslaved Sorcerers, who are kept line with Collars of Khorne and other anti-psyker technologies the Cult has created to keep them prisoners. This technology has been given to the Axes as well and the Warband has since made extensive use of it.
9th Company (Black Legion)	The 9th Company of the Black Legion is a warband of Chaos Space Marines loyal to Abaddon the Despoiler.
Apostles of Contagion	The Apostles of Contagion are a Chaos Space Marine warband that has splintered off from the Death Guard Legion[1a][1b] 4th Plague Company. They are led by the Sorcerer Necrosius[1a][1b] or the Daemon Prince Bilegush.[Conflicting sources] During their attack this warband often fill the air with warp-diseased gas clouds that kill most of the defenders melting their flesh from bones and those victims that survive left so horrendously mutated that they are unable to repel the assaulting waves of the Apostles of Contagion. By the time the Apostles of Contagion begin their assault, the battlefield is so corrupted that even reality itself begins to decay. Amidst this festering terrain, the vile incantations of the Malignant Plaguecasters summon daemons of Nurgle, who manifest to join the fray alongside their mortal allies. Apostles of Contagion Marine
Adharon's Reavers	Adharon's Reavers are a small band of Chaos Space Marine corsairs. They are led by Adharon, a former captain of the Sons of Guilliman Chapter.[1a]
66th Armoured Company	The 66th Armoured Company, also known as the Goretreads and Molossans, is a warband of the World Eaters. Specializing in armored warfare, many warriors of the 66th Armoured Company are completely fused to the machines they operate. Their neurosystems are entirely entwined with their vehicles, so that when they crush an enemy beneath their treads they feel it as if it were in their own gauntlets. Nonetheless, they are fond of close combat and each tank has been covered in blades, spinning saws, and chain flails that are just as good as smashing waves of infantry as they are anti-tank obstacles. The Goretreads are notorious throughout Ultima Segmentum, having annihilated Imperial forces many times their number. Their greatest enemies are the Aurora Chapter, who also specialize in tank warfare. This enmity is said to extend back ten millennia to the now-mysterious Battle of the Crimson Forge. They are currently among the World Eaters warbands taking part in their Daemon Primarch Angron's Blood Wave.
Apocalypse Watch	The Apocalypse Watch is a warband led by Lord Bythoss. It operates around the Maelstrom, and was often opposed to the Imperium's Marines Mordant.

Astral Blades	The Astral Blades were once a loyalist Space Marine chapter before they turned to Chaos. In 121.M37 they were led down the path to Chaos by their prideful Chapter Master, who has been possessed by the Daemon Etherak the Unrepentant. The Daemon’s servants used sorcery to possess almost every battle-brother within the Chapter’s subterranean fortress monastery one by one, slaughtering those strong enough to resist. As the blood of the last of the fallen was still cooling, the possessed Space Marines plundered the Chapter’s gene-seed stores and set off for the Eye of Terror. However, when their Battle Barge, Sword of Stars, reached high orbit, the Grey Knights were waiting for them. In the furious battle that ensued Grey Knights Terminators teleported onto the bridge of the Battle Barge and banished Etherak back into the Warp in the midst of a furious melee. Broken in body and spirit, the Chapter Master of the Astral Blades accepted the Emperor’s mercy delivered at the hands of his ‘saviours’.
Illustrians	The Black Psalm are a Chaos Space Marine warband. Originally a Loyalist Space Marine Chapter known as the Illustrians, they were among the thirty Chapters corrupted during the Abyssal Crusade.
Berserkers of Skallathrax	The Berserkers of Skallathrax were a warband of the World Eaters Legion, that operated in the Segmentum Obscurus. Their name refers to the world of Skalathrax, where the World Eaters Legion fragmented into individual warbands during the Battle of Skalathrax, following the Horus Heresy. It is believed that they were somehow connected to the notorious Khârn the Betrayer. In 777.M41, they deployed forces against the Imperium during the Achilus Crusade.

Horus	"‘And when we are done, after this hour, you will live in glory, and you will be able to say, “I was there, the day Horus slew the Emperor.” That is my pledge."[28h] Horus Lupercal was one of the 20 Primarchs created by the Emperor in the earliest days of the Imperium of Man, just after the end of the Age of Strife. Like the other Primarchs, Horus was scattered from Terra by the Gods of Chaos and was placed on a far-away world in an attempt to prevent the coming of the Age of the Imperium. Traditional accounts state that Horus was the first Primarch to be rediscovered. He was given command of the Luna Wolves, a Space Marine Legion created using Primarch's genetic template. With his Space Marine sons by his side, Horus waged war against the enemies of the Emperor during the Great Crusade. Fighting alongside his father as Lord of the Luna Wolves, he became his favoured son and beloved by most of his brother Primarchs. As result, Horus eventually rose to become Warmaster of the Great Crusade and was seen as second only to the Emperor himself in power and prestige. But in spite of all of this, he was eventually corrupted by the powers of Chaos and initiated the galaxy-spanning civil war known as the Horus Heresy against the very Imperium he helped create. When Horus was scattered, his pod landed on the world of Cthonia, a planet close to the Sol System. He was discovered by the Cthonian gang overlord Khageddon, and given the "no-name" of Nergüi. Growing up for a time under Khageddon's gang, Nergüi engaged in the perpetual gang warfare beneath Cthonia's surface that dominated the world. However his life changed dramatically when he came upon the pod he had arrived to Cthonia on, now being excavated by the Mechanicum. Nergüi engaged in battle with the Tech-Priests, killing one and recovering its weapon before running back to Khageddon. Khageddon scolded Nergüi for his recklessness, saying those he killed would chase them back to their tribal lair. Khageddon refused to give Nergüi his "kill-name" over the incident, much to the young ganger's anger. However just as Khageddon predicted, Mechanicum adepts arrived at their tribal hold and began to dig through from the surface. With the chamber collapsing around them and most of the gang dying, Khageddon instructed Nergüi to slay him to earn his kill-name. After Nergüi performed the act, he suddenly gained buried memories of the Galaxy, technology, and himself. Even his body began to swell, seemingly awakened by a trigger. When the Tech-Priests finally arrived into the chamber a Primarch stood before him: Nergüi proclaimed himself Horus.

Notably this rulebook saw the first use of a revamped logo, replacing the version first used in 3rd edition. The book is also larger in size when compared to all previous rulebooks and more akin to those from Warhammer: Age of Sigmar. The 9th Edition also saw the return of the Squats, redesigned as the Leagues of Votann. In the first of the book’s huge lore sections, you can read all about the state of the galaxy after the Cicatrix Maledictum – the Great Rift – tore open across the galaxy, dividing the Imperium in two.

The Broken	The Broken are a Chaos Space Marine warband. Originally known as the Viridian Consuls, they were among the thirty Chapters corrupted during the Abyssal Crusade. The dual pledge of the Broken is beyond any reasonable doubt once their forces are considered: Juggernauts, Plaguebearers, Bloodletters, and Khorne Berzerkers[2j][2k], with a small contingent of dedicated champions of their own with tall-horned helms and power armour that had been reforged into plates of twisted, leering faces, adorned with skulls, streaming with flayed skins[2k], as well as Nurgle-mutated marines encountered near the crash site. [2h] The Viridian Consuls were a Space Marine Chapter formed from the Ultramarines during the Second Founding.[2a]

Nurgle is the Chaos God of despair, decay, and disease. He was the third to awake of the four Gods of Chaos, fully coming into existence during Terra's Middle Ages, with plagues sweeping across continents in the wake of his birth.[1e] His titles include the Plague Father, Fly Lord, Great Corruptor, Plague Lord, Master of Pestilence, Lord of Decay[4a] (the Dark Tongue translation of his name is, Nurgh-leth)[23a][1c] Of the four Gods of Chaos, Nurgle is said to be the most involved with the plight of mortals. Those afflicted by his contagions often turn to him in order to escape their suffering. The physical likeness of Nurgle is described as gigantic and bloated with corruption, with foul-coloured, leathery and necrotic skin.[10a] Nurgle can also be regarded as the Lord of All, because all things, no matter how solid and permanent they seem, are liable to physical corruption:

Bitter Sons	The Bitter Sons were an Iron Warriors Warband.[1a] During the 13th Black Crusade, they were part of Abaddon the Despoiler's forces that invaded the Realm of Ultramar. They went on to attack the Hive World Ardium and conquer one of its three subterranean Hives, before fortifying its winding tunnel networks, as they expected the Ultramarines to come to save the Hive. During that time though, the Ultramarines's Primarch, Roboute Guilliman, was reborn and it was he who led the attack he upon Ardium to reclaim the world. The Primarch then led an attack with elements of the 4th and 6th Companies, along with some of Ardium's surviving PDF, which freed the captive Hive and destroyed the Bitter Sons Warband.[1b]

"I understand the conflict in your hearts, how one may beat for duty while the other bleeds for your Legion brothers who will be sacrificed. But this is civil war. It is a time of confusion, and realigned loyalty. We have many heads but we act as one – one Legion with a single will. We are a union of the alike and the like-minded. We will not tolerate treachery. We will not allow our compact to fracture. We will not suffer the shortsightedness of our brother Legions, nor the averted gaze of the wider Imperium. We are Alpha Legion and we take the long view." Alpharius Omegon[1d] (also known as the Last Primarch or the Lord of Serpents) was a pair of the 20 Primarchs created by the Emperor in the earliest days of the Imperium, just after the end of the Age of Strife. Like the other Primarchs, he was supposedly scattered from Terra by the Gods of Chaos and placed on a far-away world in an attempt to prevent the coming of the Age of the Imperium. In truth, Alpharius Omegon are twins known as Alpharius and Omegon respectively, though they describe themselves as one soul in two bodies.[1d] While often considered the last Primarch to be discovered, they may have been the first. However, according to Alpharius himself, this account is a lie.[5a]
3rd Company (Avenging Sons)	The Third Company of the Avenging Sons Chapter was a Space Marine Company before becoming an independent Renegade Space Marine warband in 970.M41. The company's rebellion is regarded by the Avenging Sons as a great stain on their honor. The Third Company was deployed on Archimedon, where they were charged with preventing a vital space port facility from falling into the hands of an army of heretics. Captain Gessart, guided by a vision from the Company's Librarian, Zacherys, decided to destroy the space port rather than attempting to defend it, believing that he and his Marines would not survive. Although many under his command supported his decision, the Chapter's commanders disagreed and sentenced the Company to a penance patrol. At one point during their penitence, the Third were asked for assistance from the Imperial authorities on the planet Helmabad. A group known as the Apostles of the Awakening had started an uprising against Imperial Commander Mu'shan. By the time the Space Marines arrived, however, they discovered that the reported "small insurrection" had expanded considerably - over three quarters of the population had rebelled against the Imperial government in a civil war that had raged for eight years. Undaunted, the Space Marines committed to the surface of Helmabad.
Iron Brethren	The Iron Brethren are a traitor faction of the Loyalist Iron Knights Chapter, currently believed to be lost in the Warp.

During the war, the warband sows disruption at the Sanctus Wall alongside the Reflected Ones in an alliance with Haarken Worldclaimer.

Barbican Lords	The Barbican Lords are an Iron Warriors Warband. They are among those, however, that have pledged ritualized oaths to the Effacers of Medrengard Warsmith Czagra. This has placed the Barbican Lords under his command and they are currently among Czagra's forces taking part in Abaddon the Despoiler's Ark of Omen Campaign.
Brothers of Livos	The Brothers of Livos are a Chaos Warband. They are considered to be among the most fanatical in their devotion to the Chaos Gods, alongside the Fire Reavers and Word Bearers. Because of this, the Warband views becoming a Possessed Chaos Space Marine as a great honour and believe that the Possessed are superior to Chaos Space Marines. Those Brothers of Livos who attempt to become one of the Possessed do so in mass ceremonies that are greatly celebrated by the Warband.
Adored	The Adored are an Emperor's Children Warband of reavers, that is ruled by the Warlord Xantine. However there are cracks in his rule, as the Adored chafe against their existence as petty raiders. These began to show and threaten Xantine's leadership, as he led the Adored in a raid upon an Imperial world that had been left isolated by Warp Storms. The Adored draws its earliest roots from the Horus Heresy as various members of the Emperor's Children[2b]. After the Horus Heresy, the Adored was under the leadership of the Chaos Lord Euphoros at Canticle City, and they were present at Abaddon's calamitous raid on Harmony. Despite being one of the warbands who suffered heavy losses at Abaddon's hands, Euphoros would swear fealty to Abaddon and become part of the Children of Torment. Sometime later, Euphoros's lieutenant Xantine would discover the Slaaneshi daemon S'janth trapped in an Aeldari artifact upon the world of Kalliope. Xantine would make a deal with S'janth to take her to reunite with Slaanesh, and in exchange, he would share his body for augmented power enough to challenge and kill Euphoros for leadership of the Adored and possession of the frigate Exhortation.[2a]
Goremongers (Warband)	The Goremongers are a Khorne Warband, who were once a Space Marine Chapter until they fell to Heresy and became worshipers of the Blood God.[1a]
Heralds of Despair	The Heralds of Despair are a Death Guard Warband. The Heralds revel in prolonged sieges and are obsessively methodical in their approach to warfare.

Justicars (Chapter)	The Fractured are a Chaos Space Marine warband. Originally known as the Justicars, they were among the thirty Chapters corrupted during the Abyssal Crusade.
Altar Brethren	The Iconoclasts are a Chaos Space Marine warband. Originally known as the Altar Brethren, they were among the thirty Chapters whose homeworld lay in the path of the Warp Storm Dionys that appeared in M37. In Dionys wake did the levels of mutation and cultist activity rose dramatically and the Chapters caught in it had their gene-seed corrupted. When the powerful and influential Saint Basillius heard of this, he declared all those Chapters whose homeworlds had become corrupted to be rendered into his judgement. Such was his influence that the High Lords of Terra agreed to the decision, and 30 chapters were found to be corrupted. Basillius ordered that the 30 Chapters take part in the Abyssal Crusade into the Eye of Terror, and one by one the Chapters solemnly undertook their quest of certain doom in 321.M37. When the Altar Brethren returned into Imperial Space they had been corrupted into the Iconoclasts.

The Black Feast	The Black Feast were a warband of Khorne Chaos Space Marines.[1a] The Black Feast were a cannibalistic World Eaters warband who devoured the bodies of their victims after a battle as a final mark of disrespect for their weakness. They were part of the Butcherhorde that was led by Khârn, and took part in the Black Legion's Diamor Campaign.[1a] However, like all of the Butcherhorde, they were abandoned on Amethal after the Black Legion had completed their objective, and were destroyed by the Imperium's forces defending the world.[1b]
Plaguecrows	The Plaguecrows are a Nurgle Warband. They are long-time rivals with the Vermin Guard and the Champions who command the Warbands are sworn enemies. In M42, the Plaguecrows and Vermin Guard were both among the Balefleet forces, that the Chaos Lord Gulthorg commanded in his hunt for one of Abaddon the Despoiler's Key-Fragments. This led them both to take part in the invasion of the Imperial Fortress World Cortosa III. Truthfully, however, the two Champions had only offered their allegiance to Gulthorg, so that the other could not gain the Chaos Lord's sole favor.
Abrial's Claw	Abrial's Claw is an Iron Warriors Warband, that is led by the exiled Warsmith Baldarun and his sworn ally, Abrial Shard. It was originally led by Shard alone, but he offered his Warband to Baldarun in exchange for the secrets of the Warsmith's technovirus. Baldarun agreed to this, since it gave him a chance to rebuild his standing with the Iron Warriors, after his banishment. Abrial's Claw is known to have taken part in the Scouring of Makenna VII in M41 and is infamous across many Sectors. Since the creation of the Great Rift, the warband has taken refuge in the Hadean Trinary region of the galaxy near the Galactic Core and besieged and conquered several Leagues of Votann strongholds belonging to the Greater Thurian League.

Creations of Bile	The Creations of Bile are a Chaos Warband. A collective name for the many servants and creations of Fabius Bile, these forces are used for both his own purposes as well as mercenaries for other Chaos Lords willing to pay the price. These hideously altered warriors are often used for diversionary attacks while Bile pursues his own agenda. The forces of the Creations of Bile are myriad, consisting of Terata, Gland Hounds, or warbands like the Shriven. Some are even abducted or mutated from other Chaos or loyalist armies after being abducted by Bile.

"Our brothers run to the edges of the Imperium to cower in the shadows of the Dark Gods that protect them. Only we, the Night Lords, the sons of Konrad Curze, are strong enough to stand alone. We will bring our wrath upon the empire that betrayed us, and though the ages may see us divided and broken by the endless war ahead, we will stand untainted until the stars themselves die" The Night Lords were the VIII Legion of the original twenty Space Marine Legions. Their Primarch was Konrad Curze, also called the Night Haunter. The Legion turned traitor during the Horus Heresy, after which it fought its way across Imperial space in a bloody campaign that culminated with the death of Konrad Curze at the hands of an Imperial Assassin. Since the loss of their primarch the Night Lords have based themselves in the Eye of Terror and now operate as a fragmented terror force who seem to go to war only to slaughter or acquire material possessions.
Plague Fleet	The Plague Fleet is a Death Guard fleet led by Typhus, the herald of Nurgle. Based in the Eye of Terror, the Plague Fleet emerges to spread disease and decay throughout the Imperium. The fleet ravaged the Agripinaa Sector during the 13th Black Crusade and was the first Chaos force encountered in the conflict. During the 13th Black Crusade, the Plague Fleet consisted of:
The Blessed	The Blessed are a Word Bearers Chaos Warband. They were originally members of the Word Bearers Legion during the Horus Heresy and served under Captain Darokh'Var. However, as their Legion travelled to invade Terra, Darokh'Var's warship, the Firebrand, became trapped in the Warp for several days. When the Firebrand finally re-emerged, Darokh'Var and his forces realized that over a thousand years had passed. They soon discovered that the Imperium had defeated the Traitor Legions, who had been forced to flee into the Eye of Terror. The Captain was fanatically loyal to his Primarch Lorgar, though, and led his forces to attack Imperial worlds, before fleeing back into the Warp. Once again, however, the Firebrand became trapped in the Warp and when it re-emerged yet another thousand years had passed. This cycle would continue until the 13th Black Crusade, when the Firebrand's curse was finally lifted and Darokh'Var's forces could finally join the Long War. The zealous Darokh'Var was now determined to earn the Chaos Gods' favour and renamed his forces as The Blessed. Seeking to give truth to their epitaph, the Chaos Lord has charged the Warband with undermining the Imperial faith in whatever ways they could. The Blessed now fight to topple the Imperium's idols, sacrifice its faithful and burn their shrines to the ground.
Blades of Magnus	The Blades Of Magnus are a warband of the Thousand Sons. The Blades of Magnus were the first of Prospero’s Sorcerers to devote themselves wholly to their Primarch’s salvation, working in secret to break the bond between the Crimson King and the eldritch forces he had embraced. The Blades adopted the colors of Magnus’ personal guard, the Rehati, but wore them in reverse – in this way they demonstrated their intent to save Magnus despite himself. For long years they toiled in secret, slaying those Daemons with which Magnus had made his devil’s bargains. When the Daemon Primarch learned of their works, he did not reward them, but blasted them with annihilating mental power. Now every one of them is soulless, each but a vessel for Magnus’ will.
M'kar	M'kar the Reborn was a Daemon Prince. His original name was Maloq Kartho, a Dark Apostle of the Word Bearers.[4a] During the Horus Heresy, Maloq Kartho was Dark Apostle to Hol Beloth, one of the Word Bearers commanders during the Battle of Calth.[6a] After Beloth's force was annihilated by orbital bombardment, the Word Bearers were forced underground by the gradual dispersion of Calth's atmosphere and the lethal solar radiation coming from the damaged sun.[6b] Shortly before the evacuation of the planet, Oll Persson, an ex-Imperial Army trooper who was in fact one of the last surviving Perpetuals, had, at the direction of John Grammaticus, cut a hole in reality with an athame dagger taken from one of the Word Bearers' cultists, and escaped with a small party of survivors. The daemonic entity known as M'kar was tasked with hunting them down before they could arrive at their ultimate destination. M'kar dogged Persson's footsteps across several planets and time periods (appearing sporadically throughout human history, such as at the Siege of Verdun in 1916M2). It was on the verge of killing Persson and his entire party when it was "called away", presumably to keep its assignation with Maloq Kartho.
Congregation of the Blessed Foul	The Congregation of the Blessed Foul are a Death Guard Vectorium of the 4th Plague Company. They were among the Death Guard's forces that took part in the War for the Tri-forge Cluster. During the War, the Congregation fought the forces of Tzeentch on Seixios.

Led by the Chaos Lord Vykus Skayle, the Daggerfangs differ from many of their brethren as they are faithful worshipers of the Ruinous Powers. They fought at the Morkai's Keep on the planet of Frostheim during the Siege of the Fenris System in 999.M41.
Revenants of Umidia	The Revenants of Umidia were a splinter Crimson Slaughter Warband. In the aftermath of the Great Rift's creation, the Revenants invaded the Imperial Hive World of Pyros and soon had the world under their control. However, Pyros' status as a trade hub for its surrounding Sectors made it a vital artery for the Indomitus Crusade's supply lines, and its fall caused Lord Commander Guilliman to personally lead the Crusade's forces sent to reclaim the Hive World. With the might of the Crusade's forces and his superior tactics, Guilliman destroyed the Revenants of Umidia and brought Pyros back into the Imperium's hands.
Shattered Bone	The Shattered Bone was a Chaos Warband that was destroyed in M42, by the Adeptus Custodes' Dread Host aboard the Aetropas warship. Left wrathful after not being able to prevent or aid in the Battle of Lion's Gate, the Dread Host were thorough in their destruction of the Warband. Not only was the Shattered Bone destroyed, but its fortress was toppled, the head of the Warband's leader was placed on a pike in front of the ruins and their Gene-seed was torched.
Corpsemakers	The Corpsemakers are a warband of Black Legion Chaos Space Marines. In late M41, they joined the Daemon Prince Kor Megron in the Battle of Eagle Gate in the Eydolim System. They are known for their exceptional cruelty.

Bringers of Enlightenment	The Bringers of Enlightenment are a Word Bearers Warband.
World Eaters	The World Eaters, originally known as the War Hounds, were the XII Legion of the original twenty Space Marine Legions. Their Primarch is Angron, sometimes known as The Lord of the Red Sands[15c] or the Red Angel.[16b] The Legion was amongst the first to turn traitor during the Horus Heresy. Already known for their peerless martial savagery - thanks in part to the effects of the psycho-surgical implants known as the Butcher's Nails that most of their members possessed - the World Eaters would eventually devolve into a legion of blood-crazed maniacs dedicated to the Chaos God Khorne, glorying in violence and slaughter and with no other purpose than spilling blood and taking skulls in the name of their god. After the catastrophic Battle of Skalathrax, they were scattered into disparate warbands, and have rarely fought as a unified Legion since.[14b] Alongside the Space Wolves their warriors are some of the deadliest close combat fighters in the galaxy, amongst whom are counted large numbers of the infamous Khorne Berserkers.[5c] The Twelfth Legion was formed on Terra, from no particular geographic recruiting ground. Fragmentary records do suggest, however, that during the formation process of the legion, an experimental screening process may have resulted in the initial intakes being formed from the most aggressive and competitive of candidates. While this cannot be confirmed with certainty, early records of the Legion do note that it was considered a highly aggressive, hot-blooded, and savage force.[15b]
Slaanesh	Slaanesh (Eldar - Sai'lanthresh) is the Chaos God of lust, greed, excess, pain, pleasure, perfection, and hedonism. Slaanesh was the last of the major Chaos Gods to be born—coming into existence with the collapse of the Eldar civilisation. The name Slaanesh derives from Slaaneth — the god's name in the language of Chaos, (Slaa meaning "ecstasy", "pleasure", etc, Neth meaning "lord of", "master of", or "prince of"; hence, the Prince of Pleasure). The correct adjective of things associated with Slaanesh (such as its worshipers) is "Slaaneshi".[Needs Citation] Slaanesh typically appears in a form which is female on the right side and male on the left, with two sets of horns rising from its flowing golden hair. It can, however, assume any form—male, female, hermaphrodite or asexual—but prefers male bodies. Its sacred number is six. The symbol of Slaanesh combines the conventional symbols for male and female.[1b] It is also known by a multitude of titles, such as Prince of Chaos, Prince of Excess, Prince of Pleasure and Lord of Dark Delights. To the Eldar, who name it Sai'lanthresh (literally - She Who Thirsts), and also by the titles of , She Who Is Not Named, The Great Enemy, The Great Serpent, etc. [Needs Citation]
Tzeentch	Tzeentch is a God of Chaos who represents the vitality and volatility of change. Tzeentch is closely associated with sorcery and magic, as well as dynamic mutation, and grand, convoluted scheming. The domains of history, destiny, intrigue and plots are his chief interests, and in pursuit of these aspects he listens to the dreams and hopes of all and watches their plans take form. He is not content to merely observe, however, and chooses to interfere in the skeins of fate in order to fulfil his own, unknowably complex schemes. Tzeentch is known by an endless multitude of names, but the chief titles he bears are the Changer of the Ways, the Master of Fortune, the Great Conspirator and the Architect of Fate. Tzeentch was created and sustained by the desire for change that is an essential part of nearly all mortal life; almost all species are aware of the concept of a better tomorrow, and any form of dreaming, imagining or resolution for change empowers the Chaos God. Like the other Chaos Gods, Tzeentch is strongly interested in humanity due to the power and drive of the human spirit and how that uniquely ties into his interests; no creature is more volatile or more ambitious. The spark of wishing for a different existence can turn into a fire that can change a country, a world, and perhaps ultimately an inferno that can alter the fate of galaxy itself; this is Tzeentch. Magic is essentially an expression of change driven by will, and as such is the domain of the Changer of the Ways; Tzeentch is the greatest magician in all of the Warp. Many of those drawn to his auspices are sorcerers, while many others will be gifted with sorcerous powers as a reward for their actions. Tzeentch's daemonic aspects are essentially creatures of magic rather than any sort of conventionally understandable physicality.
Cult of the Arkifane	The Cult of the Arkifane are the motley collection of damned mortals and Daemon Engines, that serve the Demi-Chaos God, Vashtorr the Arkifane. Individual armies are known as the Cogs of Vashtorr and they all fight with the infernal precision of their patron, who leads them into battle. Many Chaos Space Marines such as the Ushmengar are known to chosen to serve Vashtorr in return for the very practical and direct boons the Demi-Chaos God offers them in return. However Khorne's Berzerkers, Nurgle's Plague Marines, Tzeentch's Rubric Marines and Slaanesh's Noise Marines are not able to serve the Demi-Chaos God. Vashtorr is also known to enjoy the distraction of tinkering with his Daemon Engines, which optimize their infernal capabilities in ways that torment and enrage the Daemons trapped within them.

Eight Sons	The Eight Sons are a World Eaters Warband, that is composed of eight brothers born from the same mother. Each is a Champion in their own right and after the Great Rift's creation, the Warband and their slaves joined the Blood Crusade, that began tearing its way through the Galaxy. This led the Eight Sons to fight against the Tyranids and Orks in the Octarian War, until the Blood Wave that brought them there moved to another location. However once the Warp Storm had disappeared, the brothers found themselves left behind with their slaves. Not willing to miss the Crusade's further bloodshed, the Eight Sons decided to commit so much butchery amongst the Tyranids and Orks, that Khorne would notice the deaths they were reaping. They used the Xenos bodies to create the Blood God's symbol and killed so many that reality began to flicker as a bloody Warp Rift began to form. Sensing that Khorne was now watching them, the Eight Sons then killed their own slaves in order to hasten the Rift's opening. When it was complete, the brothers stepped through it and found themselves on another world, where a great battle was taking place in. They immediately joined it while praising Khorne and now know their duty is done on a world when another Warp Rift opens for them to charge through into the next conflict.
Sons of Damnation	The Sons of Damnation are a warband of Word Bearer Chaos Space Marines.
Prophets of Plague	The Prophets of Plague are a Death Guard Warband. They, along with the Seventh Knell and the Maggotborn, venerate Typhus the Traveler over their Daemon Primarch, Mortarion.

Hellreapers	The Hellreapers are a Chaos Space Marine warband.
Honourless	The Honourless were an Alpha Legion warband commanded by Sisyphon Vail. At one point, the Honourless joined an alliance of Alpha Legion warbands known as the Sons of the Hydra. They would later resume operating on their own. After ambushing and killing Inquisitor Godefroy Pyramus, the Honourless earned the ire of the latter's Interrogator Raughn Kiefer. From then on, the Alpha Legion group was forced to evade Kiefer who used the Cruiser Internecia to chase them. Ultimately, the Honourless crashed a freighter full of Xenos parasites onto Grendl's World; the parasites quickly turned to lush planet into a Desert World. Afterwards, the Honourless decided to wait for Kiefer, intending to finally eliminate their pursuer. Sispyhon Vail's plan mostly worked; despite his precautions, Kiefer and his force of Attilan Rough Riders and Ogryns fell into the Alpha Legionnaires' trap, although the Inquisitorial contingent managed to kill several Honourless members.
Gorestalkers	The Gorestalkers are a Black Legion Warband. Consisting of a force of bloodthirsty Khorne Berzerkers led by the Chaos Lord Gralloch Krale, they are renowned not just for their savagery but also their persistence in hunting down and killing those Abaddon wishes dead. The skulls of their foes are given as offerings to Khorne.
Sirens of Agony	The Sirens of Agony are a Slaanesh Noise Marine Warband. The Sirens' worship of noise has led them to wear helmets that cover their nose and eyes, so they only rely on their sense of hearing. The hordes of Cultists that fight beside the Warband emulate their masters and mutilate their bodies, so only their sense of hearing remains. Sometime after the Great Rift's creation, the Sirens' Strike Cruiser Pain Aeterna attacked and then boarded the Dark Angels warship, Pride of the Lion. The Dark Angels, however, defeated them and then launched a successful counter-boarding attack, which ended with the Deathwing seizing control of the Aeterna's bridge.

Neverdead	The name or term "Neverdead" may refer to:
Torments (Warband)	The Torments are a Night Lords Chaos Space Marine warband. Comprising Nemesis Claw Kill Teams, the Torments are so sadistic and bloodthirsty that even fellow Night Lords are loathe to fight alongside them. Instead, under the leadership of Grymm Shevekh, they are used as terror troops in contested warzones where they hunt enemies and make grotesque examples of those who defy them. In this role, they have wrought havoc on over a dozen worlds from Torlanda to Gheminon V. Most recently, on Bheta-Decima, they suffered heavy losses while battling Dark Eldar Mandrakes. A handful of their number escaped and seek to replenish their ranks.
Maggotborn	The Maggotborn are a Death Guard Warband. They, along with the Seventh Knell and the Prophets of Plague, venerate Typhus the Traveler over their Daemon Primarch, Mortarion. Their loyalty to him is beyond question and all three Warbands took part in Typhus' invasion of the Metalica System, during the Charadon Campaign.
Skinblades	The Skinblades are a Chaos Space Marine warband of the Night Lords active in the Choraplex. They are known to have crafted an entire forest out of bones and skin of their victims on the Warp-washed world of Garrethe.
Skullsworn	The Skullsworn are a Khorne Warband.[1a] Compared to many Khorne Warbands, the Skullsworn possess vast numbers. This is because the Daemonic Legion these blood-soaked lunatics worship is that of Skulltaker himself and his Daemonic followers in the Cohort of Blood. The Scriptures of Slaughter tell how the Cohort of Blood is a vast assemblage of Daemons many times the size of any of its counterparts. Accordingly, the Skullsworn modeled themselves after the Cohort and number in their thousands, boasting every stripe of Khorne-sworn warrior amongst their ranks. Such a sprawling host of murderers dedicated to Khorne could not operate as one, without soon turning upon each other, so the Skullsworn are scattered across the galaxy in numerous Warbands. Each Warband is led by a mighty Lord who competes with his rivals to wreak the greatest slaughter, as they each carve their own bloody path across the galaxy.[1a] Amongst the ranks of the Skullsworn there marches a band of Chaos Terminators whose deeds have become infamous. Calling themselves the Bloodtusk Brotherhood, these brutish murderers have earned great favour with Khorne.
12th Company (Emperor's Children)	Savona[2e] The Twelfth Company (or 12th Millennial)[1x] is a Company of the Emperor's Children that now acts as a Chaos Space Marine warband.[1a] Originally part of the Emperor's Children Legion under the command of the Captain Kasperos Telmar, the 12th company was corrupted by the forces of Slaanesh and fought for Horus during the Horus Heresy. Durring the Battle of Terra they seared away the remains of Sunset City.[1f] Following the Battle of Harmony and the shattering of the Emperor's Children, the 12th became its own independent warband still under the command of Telmar, now a corrupted entity known as the Radiant King in His Joyful Repose. Serving as one of the largest Emperor's Children warbands to operate outside of the Eye of Terror on a regular basis.[Needs Citation] The inner circle of the Radiant King was known as the Joybound.[1a][1b]
Sarissan Iron Pact	The Sarissan Iron Pact are a Black Legion warband. The Sarissan Iron Pact is a large sub-faction within the inner circle of the Black Legion that operates directly under the command of Abaddon the Despoiler. THe Iron Pact can trace its origins to the Sons of Horus, when they served in the 28th Armoured Assault Company. The Company fought alongside Horus throughout the Horus Heresy, particularly in Segmentum Obscurus. At some point during the Great Scouring, the 28th Armoured Assault Company ceased to exist in its established form, but from its remnants the Sarissan Iron Pact arose. This warband is heavily mechanized, consisting of formations of Spartan Assault Tanks, Land Raiders, and small numbers of Land Raider Achilles. Much of their infantry consists of Chaos Terminators.
Eradicatus Corps	The Eradicatus Corps are a Purge Warband.
Silvered Sons	The Silvered Sons are a Thousand Sons Warband. The Warband is currently invading the T'au Empire Sept World Dy'aketh, in order to claim the priceless Voridium Sceptre artefact, which is housed within one of its research facilities. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Sentinels	A Sentinel is a bipedal, all-terrain walker used by the Imperial Guard for a number of missions including reconnaissance and search-and-destroy. When the nascent Imperium reunited with the Knight Worlds during the Great Crusade, they found that, in addition to the Knights used in battle by the nobility, there were also lesser unarmed frames used by Drovers – the non-noble herdsmen who tended the fields and estates. One such popular and tested frame, the Drover suit, would be armed and adapted into the Sentinel widely used by the Imperial Army and Imperial Guard. The Sentinel achieves movement with a pair of articulated legs, which allow for both maneuverability in dense environments and bursts of speed on open terrain. The walker is even capable to spin around on one leg. They are fitted with advanced gyro-stabilizers to improve their balance, and their powerplants include noise-reduction technology for stealthy operation. Though it cannot move with the speed of the wheeled vehicle, the Sentinel can run, much like a man. By condensing its leg pistons and lowering the cockpit, the Sentinel is even able to jump while moving at full speed, continuing to fire its weapon system in the process. In case the walker drops ten feet, the fall is absorbed by the Sentinel's hydromechanics.
Murder Bringers	The Murder Bringers is a World Eaters warband noted for their extensive use of Jakhals.
True Sons	The True Sons are a warband of the Sons of Horus and one of the Thrice-Cursed Traitors, those who turned their back on Abaddon the Despoiler after he took command of the Legion, refusing to become part of the Black Legion. The True Sons never broke the tradition of worshiping their Primarch Horus as a god, and cover their armour in the symbol of the Eye of Horus. The True Sons build effigies of Horus wherever they go, bowing down to them before symbolically setting them ablaze.

Sons of Oblivion	The Sons of Oblivion are a warband of the Black Legion. They took part in the Diamor Campaign as a part of the Hand of Xorphas — army of Chaos Sorcerer Xorphas.
Flickering Blades	The Flickering Blades were a Slaanesh warband led by the infamous Noise Champion Volupus. They enjoy close combat and stride into battle wielding lithe swords, that sing a song of death with every swing. Their Power Armour is heavily mutated with numerous mouths emerging from them, each one with a writhing tongue that licks their lips in anticipation of the blood-splattering of close combat. The Flickering Blades arrogantly claimed they were unrivaled in swordsmanship. When the Skull Takers of Hans Kho'ren heard of this, they launched a brutal assault on the Blades' slave pleasure den within the Eye of Terror, proving them wrong and wiping out the warband entirely—each skull dedicated to Khorne.
Serpents of Light	The Predator Legion are a Chaos Space Marine warband. Originally known as the Serpents of Light, they were among the thirty Chapters corrupted during the Abyssal Crusade.
Twisted Blades	The Twisted Blades are a Chaos Space Marine warband. Originally known as the Graven Fists, they were among the thirty Chapters corrupted during the Abyssal Crusade.

Rodrigo Nessun	Rodrigo Nessun was a Cardinal and trusted servant of the Ecclesiarchy, who betrayed the Imperium and created the Swords of Epiphany Warband. This occurred, when Nessun was attached to the Ordo Malleus' Plutonians sect, who were stationed on the Exorcists Chapter's Homeworld Banish. There the sect used Daemonic Possession on the Exorcists' Aspirants in order for them to become effective Daemon hunters. However, Nessun was struck by a revelation, when he encountered Aspirants who had failed their trials due to succumbing to possession. They were slated to be destroyed, but the changes he saw upon their bodies, convinced Nessun the failed Aspirants were a higher breed of warrior. In his mind, the Cardinal believed, they could take Humanity forward. Nessun then escaped with a contingent of the failed Aspirants and soon the Swords of Epiphany Warband were born. The now former Cardinal, baptized them as servants of Chaos, but their existence could not be tolerated by the Exorcists. Captain Veyon Armadel was charged with launching the Armadel's Purge to destroy the Warband and hounded the Swords of Epiphany. The Captain's hunt led him to wherever the Warband was sighted, until at last the Swords were declared destroyed.
Pistonhand's Daemoniforge	Pistonhand's Daemoniforge are a World Eaters Warband, that is commanded by the Chaos Lord Azgorek Varren, who is also known as the Pistonhand. They were formed after Varren's forces captured the Forge Moon Weldcog and used it to construct thousands of Daemon Engines. This required a Chaos ritual to draw forth Khorne's Daemons to possess the engines and the Chaos Lord ordered that eighty-eight percent of Weldcog's population be slaughtered. Their deaths gave birth to the Warband and the Daemoniforge have long spread death and have feasted on the slain of dozens of worlds.
Voidmaws	The Voidmaws are a Chaos Warband. They were among the Chaos forces, the Black Legion used to attack the Systems around Vigilus, during the War of Beasts. At that time, the Voidmaws were under the Black Legion Warpsmith Vask's command and took part in the successful invasion of the Adeptus Mechanicus Artificial Moon, Pergamatros.

Night Stalkers	The Night Stalkers are a Chaos Space Marine warband, skilled in the art of implementing ambushes.
Vaithan Reaver Squad	The Vaithan Reaver Squad was a Sons of Horus Warband. They were formed by the Sons of Horus Captain Erekan Juric after the Traitor Legions fled into the Eye of Terror following their defeat by the Imperium. The Warband's end came soon after, however, when the Sons of Horus began to be attacked by the other Traitor Legions, who blamed them for the Horus Heresy's failure. The Vaithan Reaver Squad were shattered in one such attack, when the Thousand Sons Sorcerer Kahotep led his Legion's forces to breech the defenses of the Warband's stronghold on a blighted world within the Eye. Juric knew the day was lost after this happened, and as the Thousand Sons swarmed into his fortress, he ordered the Reavers to escape within the Warband's Thunderhawks. Only half of the surviving Reavers were able to do so, though, and Juric himself was burned alive by Kahotep when he attempted to kill Sorcerer.
Chromite Beasts	The Chromite Beasts are an Iron Warriors Warband, that specializes in void-warfare. They are among the Traitor Legion's forces, that have pledged ritualized oaths to the Effacers of Medrengard Warsmith Czagra. This has placed the Chromite Beasts under his command and they are currently among Czagra's hordes taking part in Abaddon the Despoiler's Ark of Omen Campaign.
Sons of Rot	The Sons of Rot were once a Space Marine Chapter, but they now worship the Chaos God Nurgle and are led by the Chaos Lord Gulthorg. They have since become affiliated with the Death Guard. In M42, they were among the Balefleet forces, that Gulthorg commanded in his hunt for one of Abaddon the Despoiler's Key-Fragments. This led the Sons of Rot to take part in the invasion of the Imperial Fortress World Cortosa III.
The Foresworn (World Eaters)	The Foresworn are a World Eaters warband believed to be the largest of the broken Legion thanks to the leadership of its Chaos Lord, Kossolax the Foresworn.[8a] The Foresworn has its origins with Kossolax the Foresworn, originally a Sergeant of the World Eaters 3rd Assault Company during the Horus Heresy. After being stranded on Terra after Horus' death, Kossolax (then known as Solax) organized a retreat with his brothers and managed to form their own warband. In time, it grew to become massively powerful thanks to Kossolax's ruthlessness, intellect, and sheer determination.[8a] By the Age of the Dark Imperium The Foresworn was not only absorbing large numbers of World Eaters, but also had subordinated many other warbands to it from the Night Lords, Death Guard, and traitors from an array of other Chapters. The four greatest warriors of The Foresworn are known as The Four and act as Kossolax's lieutenants.[8a]
Sanctors of Terra	The Blighted Claw are a Chaos Space Marine warband. Originally known as the Sanctors of Terra, they were among the thirty Chapters corrupted during the Abyssal Crusade. Now led by their former Chapter Master Paramyx, they have dedicated themselves to spreading Nurgle's plagues amongst the worlds of the Imperium. One of their deeds was the incursion on the planet Gehöft where, with the might of the Daemonic legions of Nurgle and virulent Zombie Plague, they inflicting heavy losses to the united army of the White Scars, Dark Angels and Brindelweld Seventeenth Imperial Guard Regiment and forced the Imperium to bring down the Exterminatus on the unfortunate planet. Paramyx managed to escape the retribution.
Wrath (Warband)	The Wrath are a Khorne Warband.[1a] The Wrath are little more than ferocious Power Armoured beasts, that bring butchery in the battlefield to an unimaginable scale, by completely eradicating the bodies of their foes. The source of this monstrous savagery is the Warband's worship of the Bloodthirster of Insensate Rage Arbra'Gax, and his horrific honour guard the Charnel Reapers, whose ferocity they seek to imitate. So complete is the Wrath's devotion to Arbra'Gax, that the Bloodthirster's fury has seeped into their souls and set them aflame with hate. As a result mere slaughter is not enough for these feral warriors and at the end of a battle, the Wrath fall upon the corpses of the slain, cannibalizing friend and foe alike in a hideous victory feast. Blood is guzzled, skin is peeled, then hacked into ragged cloaks and face masks that are draped across the Wrath's armour. Bones are ripped free and pushed through the warriors' skin as crude totems, while organs are crushed to a foul paste that is used to anoint weapons and wargear. Finally, all that remains are the fleshless skulls of the fallen, which are piled into tottering heaps as an offering to Khorne, before the Warband leaves in search of new prey. Such is their savage reputation that even in murderous haunts as Commorragh and the Eye of Terror, they are whispered of with awe.[1a] Wrath Chaos Space Marine[1b]
Blighted Sons	The Blighted Sons are a Nurgle Warband, that are known to have fought in the Charadon war zone as a part of Typhus's army.
Oath-Broken	The Oath-Broken are a warband of the Black Legion. Consisting of those who have failed in battle or have been crippled by wounds. They did not receive healing from the Ruinous Powers, but the Oath-Broken fashion their own replacements and are known to use stumps, Xenos appendages, and bionics.
Chaos Undivided	Followers of Chaos Undivided venerate Chaos itself, seeing the Gods of Chaos as a pantheon to be worshiped equally. Of all Chaos worshipers they follow Chaos in its purest form. Champions of the creed are given a Mark of Chaos Undivided. A follower of Chaos as a whole may also honour the lesser entities of the warp if they are more likely to help him. Others view Chaos Undivided as a unified whole, the various powers as actually an aspect of one god. They may give their service to one god but are likely to never gain much favour with an individual power.
Tide of Filth	The Tide of Filth are a large Death Guard Warband led by the Lord of Virulence Ghulgh Thraxoplasmox.
Gorechain	The Gorechain are a small Night Lords Warband, that worships the Chaos God Khorne. In M42, they invaded the Imperial Archive Moon Kataloghia, which lies within the Nachmund Gauntlet. The Salamanders aboard the Pyrelight came to Kataloghia's aid, though, and the Gorechain was finally defeated in what became known as the Battle for the Vaults of Blood. What occurred in those blood-drenched halls, however, has left the surviving Space Marines haunted and they would burn the Vaults to the ground afterwards. The Pyrelight's Salamanders have so far refused to share what they witnessed there to anyone outside of their ranks.
Reaver-Kithe	The Reaver-Kithe are a Khorne Warband that uses serrated axes.
Thirsting Brethren	The Thirsting Brethren are an Emperor's Children Warband.
Apocalypse	The name or term "Apocalypse" may refer to: Warhammer 40,000 Apocalypse, an expansion for Warhammer 40,000 designed for fielding massive armies Apocalypse (Novel), from the Space Marine Conquests series
Crimson Covenant	The Crimson Covenant were a World Eaters Warband.
Poxherders	The Poxherders are a Death Guard Vectorium. They were among the Death Guard's forces that took part in the War for the Tri-forge Cluster. There, the Vectorium took a sick delight in culling some of the monstrous creatures that had begun to spawn near Thrios' Sludge lake, in the wake of the Death Guard's invasion. The Poxherders' Foul Blightspawn and Biologus Putrifiers later began to harvested scores of venoms, toxins and maladies from the corrupted landscape. They also went on to harvest the hideous monsters that inhabited the Sludge as well. They then used these ingredients to brew a toxin, that the Poxherders used to completely dissolve Thrios' Hive Beranthis. Afterwards, all that was left of the Hive was a primordial soup, that countless more diseases and creatures rapidly evolved from.
Rustwalkers	The Rustwalkers are a Death Guard Vectorium, of the 4th Plague Company. They were among the Death Guard's forces that took part in the War for the Tri-forge Cluster. There, the Vectorium joined the invasion of Thrios and seized a factorum, that produced variants of Hellhounds, early in the invasion. Under the leadership of their Chaos Lord, Ferund Irnwelt, the Rustwalkers's Sorcerers and Dark Mechanicum allies corrupted the factorum's ancient machinery. This resulted in its Hellhounds possessing ferociously warped Machine Spirits and the Death Guard had their most fanatical followers crew the tanks. Scores were created with each passing day and then sent against the Imperium's forces defending Thrios. Weeks of this went by, until an Imperial strike force was sent to attack the factorum and stop any more of the corrupted Hellhounds' from being created. Composed of lances of House Adamant and Althalos's Knights, as well as battalions of Thrios Furnaceguard infantry, the attack initially went well. The Imperials were able to push their way through the Cult's defending the factorum and entered its depths. However this had been allowed by Lord Irnwelt, who soon sprung an ambush upon the invaders. In the battle that followed, numerous corrupted Hellhounds, Cultists, and the Rustwalkers themselves, ensured that the Imperial strike force was completely destroyed.
Bloodgorged	The Bloodgorged are a Khorne Warband.[1a] The fury of the Bloodgorged are feared by all, but none more so than those who offer praise to Khorne's sibling rivals. The Bloodgorged see those who worship Nurgle, Tzeentch or Slaanesh as blinkered fools, whose misplaced faith cannot go unpunished. They further believe that there is no greater offering to Khorne than the violently obtained blood and skulls of those who worship his brothers. To this end, the Bloodgorged fight a war of faith as they prey upon the followers of the other Chaos Gods and their attack ships haunt the Eye of Terror, the Maelstrom and many other hunting grounds where Chaos Space Marines may be found. Meanwhile, Cultists labour in their name all across the galaxy, stamping out rival sects and preparing the way for the Bloodgorged to invade their worlds. At such times the slaughter reaches new heights, with the surprised defenders of the targeted worlds, scrambling to drive off the warring Chaos factions. The Bloodgorged revel in the gory mayhem of such conflicts, for only in such anarchic bloodbaths can Khorne truly be offered praise.[1a] To the galactic west of the Golgotha System, mired amid violently shifting Warp currents, the Skullstar hangs menacingly in the void. A furiously burning solar body of enormous size, this star is aptly named for it resembles nothing so much as an almighty, leering skull. Historically, voidfarers have steered well clear of this baleful phenomenon for the Skullstar is said to drive men mad with hatred. To the Bloodgorged though, the Skullstar is nothing less than a divine manifestation of Khorne's boundless wrath. In their efforts to worship the baleful star, the Bloodgorged's warships long ago braved the Warp storms surrounding it and landed hordes of Cultists and labourers upon the arid, radiation-ravaged worlds that hung in the Skullstar's orbit. Years later, those worlds have become fortified strongholds that the Bloodgorged command, and where vast brazen idols of Khorne tower hundreds of feet over the barren deserts. Across the Warband's domain, bloody altars rise from mountains of skulls, dark temples echo to harsh litanies of heretical worship, and all the while Daemons prowl under the searing light of the Skullstar that leers over them all.[1a]
Whispering Shadow	The Whispering Shadow are a Night Lords Warband.
Blood Legion of Khorne	The Blood Legion of Khorne were a warband of World Eaters. They assaulted the world of Lorn V and struck a deal with a local Ork Warboss, Gorgutz. The Warband eventually came into conflict with the Orks over the remains of an Imperator Class Titan.

Lashdrum Monarchs	The Lashdrum Monarchs are a Flawless Host Warband.
The Purge	The Purge are a Chaos Space Marine warband dedicated to the Chaos God Nurgle. They are infamous for their genocidal campaigns and indiscriminate use of chemical weapons. Once loyal Space Marines, the Purge first appeared in late M36, having been consumed by the belief that the galaxy is hopelessly corrupt and the only way to purity lies in death. Even within the holds of Chaos the Purge are a feared and mysterious chapter. Though the Purge have uncertain origins, their numbers grow steadily as they continue to bring death to dozens of worlds. In battle, the Purge advance slowly and systematically exterminate all traces of life with their poison gas and other indiscriminately deadly weapons. The Purge despise life in all its forms and have waged war against aliens and mankind alike for 3000 years, attempting to exterminate all life in the galaxy. Where the Purge attack, famine and pestilence soon follow. They are known to frequently employ Blight Drones in battle.
Tizcan Host	The Tizcan Host are a warband of the Thousand Sons. The Tizcan Host is known for its shared delusion. Every one of its Sorcerers believes he passed from mortality entirely at the time of the Rubric, and that he has been reborn as an avenging angel. To this end the Tizcan host wears white, a colour often associated with purity and soundness of spirit. These are claims that grow more dubious with every passing year, for that sacred white has been stained red with blood countless times over the millennia. The host still believes it has but one duty – to rain the righteous fire of the Crimson King Magnus upon the Imperium that once dared cast him out. Though they pretend to a superior, otherworldly goodness, the Tizcan Host is perhaps the most warlike thrallband of all. The icon of the Tizcan Host is the Horned Crown – made in remembrance to the circlet worn by the deity of ancient Prosperine, the King of All Angels. The Rubricae of the Tizcan Host are known as the Seraphya. The icons of their masters-sorcerers are scorched into their tabards and armour before each battle and their silence and stilness now perceived by their masters as stoicism and loyalty, though the truth is far more sad. The Tzaangors that followed Tizcan Host in battles are known as the Choir of Eagles (this term dates back to the Great Crusade) and their harsh squawks and cries now sounds as a grotesque mockery of the songstrels of human auxiliaries of those times.
Butcherhorde	The Butcherhorde is an infamous warband of World Eaters Chaos Space Marines. Led by the infamous Khârn, the Butcherhorde was formed originally from the insane Berzerkers who followed The Betrayer. Over time as he has slaughtered his way across the Galaxy - from the Sundered Reach to Pandoric Colonies, the warband has grown to encompass all manners of Khornate devotees. These include ordinary Chaos Space Marines, Cultists, mutants, Daemon Princes, and Daemon Engines (including Brass Scorpions and Lords of Skulls). There is no force of World Eaters in the galaxy more dangerous than the Butcherhode, for each warrior strives to be more like Kharn than the last. They are utterly devoted to worship of Khorne and have fully embraced the madness of the Butcher's Nails. They charge into the fray without care for themselves, seeking only to spill blood for the blood god. They have slaughtered their way through Ork hordes, Tyranid swarms, Imperial Guard tank Regiments, Squat Kindreds, and even other World Eaters.
Mind-Eaters	The Mind-Eaters were a Thousand Sons Warband under the command of Hasophet.[1a]
Nihilant Banes	The Nihilant Banes are a Purge Warband.
The Tainted	The Tainted are a large Chaos Space Marine warband dedicated to Nurgle.[1a] The Tainted are a large sub-faction of the Death Guard legion. They worship Nurgle in his aspects as father of despair[1a] and mortifier of flesh.[2b] The warband possesses a bestiary of Chaos Spawn, Plague Ogryns and other mutated creatures known as the "Rotted Circus". The most infamous of their creatures is a massive plague-spawn called Jibberjaw.[1b]
Gladiator Group 138	Gladiator Group 138 are a warband of World Eaters. They are led by Kraagon Gorefist, who earned his 'slaughter crown' from Khorne for his brutality during the battle. Gladiator Group 138 are known as bloodthirsty, insane, and savage fighters that prefer close combat. The warband took part in the Battle of Eagle Gate and laid siege to the Adeptus Mechanicus world of Lector's Lowel.
Crimson Fangs	The Crimson Fangs are a World Eaters Warband, that is commanded by the Warlord known as the Eater. To him, the Galaxy is full of rich pickings, which the Eater finds by seeking out cries for aid. One such cry came from the Imperial world Cirkun, where a Genestealer Cult had begun an uprising. The Warlord subsequently unleashed his Crimson Fangs upon the Cultists who began slaying them. The Warband was able to do what the Imperium's forces could not and Cirkun's population began joining in the Crimson Fang's attacks. The world was then engulfed in a war between the Eater's Warband, the Imperials and the Cultists. However soon the Tyranids of Hive Fleet Behemoth invaded Cirkun as well and the war for the world still rages on.
The Fallen	The Fallen are renegade Space Marines that split off from the Dark Angels Space Marine Legion ten thousand years ago and have since been scattered across space and time by a Warp Storm. They are the secret enemy of the Unforgiven, a group containing the modern Dark Angels Chapter and its successors. To those Fallen that dwell within the 41st Millennium, many have become Chaos Space Marines, others pirate and renegade warlords, while some have since regretted their heresy and live a life of peaceful seclusion. Others have even gone on to loyally serve the Imperium. The seeds of the Fallen have were planted during the Great Crusade. During the campaign against the Sarosh, enemy forces managed to sneak a nuclear warhead aboard the Invincible Reason, flagship of Lion El'Jonson, Primarch of the Dark Angels. Luther, 2nd in command of the Legion, discovered the plot but for a time his jealousy of the Lion prevented him from stopping it. In the end, however, he saved the Lion's life, but somehow his primarch discovered his hesitation. Luther and his forces were forced to return to Caliban in the aftermath, ostensibly for recruitment and administrative purposes but many felt it was akin to banishment. Luther and The Lion had another falling out after the Zaramund Campaign when Luther left Caliban to fight alongside Horus in the Zaramund Campaign. As the Lion's absence from Caliban increased due to the Horus Heresy, Luther and his forces increasingly felt bitter and abandoned, left to deal with a rebellion by Caliban's disgruntled former nobility and Chaos affiliated Sorcerers. The Warp-taint plaguing Caliban became apparent, and Luther and his followers became convinced that Caliban would be destroyed by the Emperor when this became known. They believed that The Lion had knowingly exiled them as a death sentence. Thus the seeds of Heresy were planted. The Fallen degraded into even further treachery when an expedition to Caliban led by the loyal Dark Angels Chapter Master Belath arrived before Luther. Eventually, Astelan and Zahariel led a purge against those among Belath's forces who would be loyal to the Lion, including the Chapter Master himself.
Virulent Band	The Virulent Band are a Chaos Warband. They seek to purge their enemies entirely by contaminating supplies, sabotaging life-support machinery and infecting vital systems. As all crumbles to ruin, the Virulent Band emerges victorious.
Chaos Space Marine Armoury	The Chaos Space Marine Armoury is divided into four lists - For individual armouries, see also:
Viscerati	The Viscerati are a World Eaters warband. Consisting of large amounts of Possessed and Eightbound, they are led by Slaughterbound Jarrok Skreel. They were active during the Season of Blood on Armageddon.
Bleeding Eye	The Bleeding Eyes are a Night Lords-affiliated Chaos Raptor cult. A populous brotherhood, the Bleeding Eye operates in cells across several Sectors of the Galaxy and ally themselves with other Chaos Space Marine warbands, often acting as mercenaries. The warband is known to partake in acts of cannibalism, eating falling enemies.
Tower of Blood (Short Story)	Tower of Blood is a short story by Tony Ballantyne. It was originally published in Hammer and Bolter 6, and re-published in the anthology Space Marine. It was later republished online in August 2015. One thousand floors has the tower, one thousand floors of blood, death and daemons. A squad of Iron Knights must fight their way to the top of the building to fight the mighty daemon that lurks there. Unless they can prevent its foul ritual, all the filth of Chaos will drown the world in corruption. Can even the courage and determination of a Space Marine commander triumph against such odds?
Bloody Daggers	The Bloody Daggers are a Chaos Space Marine Warband. In M42, the Warband was attacked by the Dark Angels Ravenwing, for the actions of one of its members. Known as the Sower of Deceitful Truths, he had cast three Imperial Systems into traitorous anarchy and had deactivated the watch-savants deployed to watch over the Ork empire of Gorak Thugga. This allowed Waaagh! Thugga to overwhelm its neighboring Sub-Sector, which left no survivors. It was for these actions that the Ravenwing launched an overwhelming attack to destroy the Warband, but the Bloody Daggers' use of Missile Launchers nearly allowed them to escape. This ended, though, after a squadron of the Deathwing teleported behind the Warband and, now caught between the two Dark Angels forces, the Bloody Daggers were destroyed.
Bloody Dawn	The Bloody Dawn are a World Eaters Warband. They were once led by the Chaos Lord Macer Krassek, but this began to end, when he was fused with the core of his flagship. In this new existence, Krassek was able to feel his ship's kills, as if they were his own axe-slayings. Few can appreciate this and the Bloody Dawn was among those who did not, as they were unable to feel these kills. Because of this, the Warband once demanded to be deployed from Krassek's flagship, so they could feel ground beneath their feet and blood upon their skin. The Chaos Lord viewed them as ignorant for this request and his contempt for the Bloody Dawn led him to begin conducting a plan. For the next seven campaigns, Krassek forbade his Warband from attacking and instead conducted orbital bombardments on the worlds they targeted. On the eighth such world, though, the Chaos Lord relented and allowed the Bloody Dawn to invade it. However once they were all on the world, Krassek immediately opened fire upon it. Its not clear what the Bloody Dawn's current status is.
Gorehands	The Gorehands are a large Khorne Warband that took part in the Thirteenth Black Crusade's invasion of Cadia.
Cursed Company	The Cursed Company are a Chaos Space Marine warband that is taking part in the Thirteenth Black Crusade.
Skulltaker	Skulltaker or U'Zuhl is a Bloodletter Champion of Khorne. It is said that when Khorne created U'Zuhl, his first act was to chop the head from the first creature he met, another Bloodletter, thus beginning his existence of decapitation across the mortal and immortal universes. When U'Zuhl took his 888th skull, Khorne anointed him as his Sacred Executioner and he earned his title Skulltaker. Skulltaker often fights in battles at the head of his own army - the Cohort of Blood, which includes the best Bloodletters, personally chosen by him from among the numerous legions of daemons. In the middle of the greatest slaughter, Skulltaker always seeks out the mightiest of the enemy's warriors, hacking through the fray with his wickedly serrated blade so that he may confront his chosen opponent. Those that flee are cut down immediately, while those that stand and fight suffer a slower and much more painful death. Skulltaker is a duellist beyond compare, always dismembering and despoiling, but never slaying. Only when his foe is limbless upon the ground does Skulltaker allow him final release. He grasps their head in his hand, and offering the eight Words of Sacrifice, wreathes his victim's head in magical fire, burning away at their flesh until only bare skull remained. He then tears the skull free, holds it aloft for all to see, and places his prize in the great sack he carries on his back, along with all the trophies taken in that battle.
War Dogs	The War Dogs are a Chaos Space Marine warband.
Black Skull	The Black Skull are a warband of Chaos Space Marines. They battled the Crimson Sabres at the Battle of Nebulon.
Magnus the Red	"If I am guilty of anything, it is the simple pursuit of knowledge"[6b] Magnus the Red (also known as the Crimson King, the Sorcerer-King, Cyclopean Magnus or the Red Cyclops) is the Primarch of the Thousand Sons Chaos Space Marine legion. A giant in both physical and mental terms whilst a mortal inhabitant of the materium, Magnus long tried to understand and control the warp, becoming a sorcerer of formidable power. Magnus would eventually fall from favour with his father, the Emperor, and with the majority of his brother-primarchs due to his zealous advocacy and use of such power. Indeed it would prove to be his mortal undoing, as, forewarned of Horus' fall to Chaos, his attempt to use his own warp-touched abilities to alert the Emperor to the situation brought about his own damnation and servitude to the Chaos God Tzeentch. Magnus led his own troops to the banner of Horus and fought on his side during the Great Betrayal, surviving the events and being elevated to the position of Daemon Prince. He has spent the majority of the millennia since ensconced atop his tower upon the Planet of the Sorcerers, planning the destruction of the Imperium. Magnus, as an infant, was dropped onto the remote colony world of Prospero. Magnus was unique among his brothers as he was entirely aware of his own birth and development, and remembers his infancy completely. He also regularly communed with the Emperor via telepathy before their official reunion. Magnus was incredibly fortunate to land on Prospero, as anywhere else his psychic nature would have made him an outcast, shunned and hunted. Prospero was a world of outcast human psykers, making him nothing special in the eyes of the colonists. They had chosen Prospero for its remoteness from Terra. When Magnus fell from the skies, it was like a portentous comet. His pod landed in the central plaza of all the places on the planet[Needs Citation].
Sons of Vengeance	The Sons of Vengeance are a Chaos Space Marine Warband.[1a] The Sons of Vengeance fought for the Imperium of Man during the first part of the Obscuran Uprisings in late M34. But after the destruction of the Free Council of Hannedra II they became drunk with power. They crushed the rebellion in the name of the Emperor but proceeded to loot and slaughter indiscriminately. They further took their campaign to the neighbouring system of Laskaria. By the time the Lords of Terra responded, the Sons and Silver Guards had fractured into dozens of warbands and turned fourteen star systems into their savage battleground as the spilt each other's blood in a savage war for dominance.[1a] Their last known location was Cadia, during the 13th Black Crusade.[1b]
The Chosen of Nemeroth	The Chosen of Nemeroth were a warband of Chaos Space Marines under the command of the Chaos Lord Nemeroth. Invading the Forge World of Graia through a Warp gate, Nemeroth's warband of traitor Space Marines, Cultists, and Daemons ravaged the planet in a plot to have Nemeroth himself ascend to Daemonhood. In the end however they were defeated by Captain Titus of the Ultramarines, and the Chosen of Nemeroth were destroyed with their master.
Eightscarred	guards[1c] The Eightscarred are a Khorne Warband.[1a] The Eightscarred are unhinged fanatics who see themselves as Khorne's only true disciples and their horrific zealotry has driven them from one war zone to the next, in a never-ending tidal wave of gore. The sheer zealotry of the Eightscarred draws many Khorne Berzerkers to their banner, and such is Warband's devotion to Khorne, that during battles they easily draw from the Warp the Daemonic followers of their patron the Bloodthirster Gha’Kharax; who they have fought alongside on many occasions. Gha’Kharax sits in constant judgement of the members of the Eightscarred however and those who join the Warband have eight battles in which to prove their worth to the Bloodthirster of the Third Rank. If he approves of a warrior’s efforts then, at battle's end, he reaches through the veil to carve a livid scar in that warrior's flesh. One by one, these bloody wounds form the rune of Khorne, marking the warrior as worthy to fight alongside Gha'Kharax's and his Daemonic followers in his cohort. Should an aspirant ever fail to earn his scar, he will gladly fall upon his own roaring chainblade, as an act of penance to Khorne.[1a]
Brotherhood of Lethe	The Brotherhood of Lethe are a Chaos Space Marine warband. Originally known as the Crusaders of Dorn, they were among the thirty Chapters corrupted during the Abyssal Crusade.
Crimson Claws (Warband)	The Crimson Claws are a Black Legion Warband. They were among the Chaos forces that attacked Cadia, during the 13th Black Crusade. However after the Despoiler dealt the Fortress World a death blow, the Warband joined the hunt to destroy the Imperium's forces, as they fled the Cadian System. During the Nachmund Rift War, the Crimson Claws took part in the invasion of Sangua Terra as part of Haarken Worldclaimer's host. During the war, its ambitious commander Vyhex disobeyed Haarken's orders and sought personal glory against the Imperials instead of pursuing nearby Ork forces. As a price for this, he was killed and mutilated into a hideous form due to the mark of the Daemon Prince Tchorr'Kan.
Blades of Sinister	The Blades Sinister is a Thousand Sons warband of the Cult of Time under the command of T'sathis Vhorr. Its members have the ability to leap throughout the timestream, ambushing foes when and where they least expect it.
Chosen of Khorne (Audio Book)	Chosen of Khorne is a Black Library audio drama by Anthony Reynolds. It was published in September 2012. Deep within the Eye of Terror, the followers of the blood god Khorne war amongst themselves to win their patron’s favour, and for the right to lead a new crusade against the Imperium in his name. Argus Brond, berserker champion of the old World Eaters Legion, has called upon his old comrade Khârn for assistance – surely, this legendary warrior will break the deadlock and secure victory for him? But Khârn, known with good reason as 'the Betrayer', is far more than just a crazed killer, and his own agenda will always come first...
Choir of Aberrance	The Choir of Aberrance are a Noise Marine Warband that is active in the Screaming Vortex. The members demand tribute in the form of slaves, which are fitted with an array of sonic amplifiers and vox speakers that cause the recipient great pain and amplify every tortured cry and terrified gasp to skull-shattering heights. They are then marched into battle, staggering behind their captors in vast processions bound together with golden chains each adorned with savage and delicate hooks.
Coven of Nine	The Coven of Nine are a large Tzeentch Warband and was among the Chaos God's forces that invaded the Stygius Sector during the Thirteenth Black Crusade. The Coven is commanded by six powerful Sorcerers who each lead vast warhosts of Chaos Space Marines, Daemons and Cultists.
Bloodblessed	The Bloodblessed are a Khorne Warband. The Bloodblessed make great use of Chaos Spawn in their Warband and fanatically round up great hordes of the mutated beasts to use in battle. Unlike other Khonre Warbands, the Bloodblessed believe Chaos Spawns to be the true form that Khorne desires for mortals. Stranger still, the Warband's Champions aspire not to ascend to Daemonhood, but to become Chaos Spawn themselves. To the Bloodblessed, spawndom is not seen as a dire punishment, but is instead viewed as the ultimate reward. They are known to have taken part in the Season of Blood.
Spears of Olympus	The Bloodlords are a Chaos Space Marine warband. Originally known as the Spears of Olympus, they were among the thirty Chapters corrupted during the Abyssal Crusade. The symbol worn by all Bloodlords is a crushed heart.[2b] On planet Anachron Bloodlords under orders of Sabaktes fought World Eaters taking Lord of Skulls as a prize. The machine spirit of Bloodhammer refused to cooperate with captain Navarch Ladon.[2c]
Bloody Path	The Bloody Path were a World Eaters warband.[1a] They waged a century-long war against the Orks of Waaagh! Killstomp and adorned their power armour with tassels of Ork flesh, signifying their victories against the Waaagh!. They were later part of the Butcherhorde that was led by Khârn and took part in the Black Legion's Diamor Campaign[1a]. However, like all of the Butcherhorde, they were abandoned on Amethal after the Black Legion had completed their objective and were destroyed by the Imperium's forces defending the world.[1b]
Children of Blain	The Children of Blain, more commonly known as the Chil'Blains, are a Death Guard Warband. The Warband was originally the Steel Cobras Space Marine Chapter, until they turned to heresy and hid from Imperial forces on the Ice World Tukaroe VII. However they soon became trapped by a Chaos tainted storm and then became sick, as infections quickly spread amongst them. With his warriors dying, the Steel Cobras' Chapter Master, Akhasis Blain, made a pact with a mysterious wanderer known as Barkahran, who promised he could save the Chapter if they dedicated themselves to Nurgle. The Steel Cobras agreed and became the Children of Blain, who have since become one of the Death Guard's many Warbands. While the Warband still wears the same bronze-green armour of the Steel Cobras, they now paint sections of it white to represent Tukaroe VII, where they were reborn as Nurgle's servants.
Blades of Rage	The Blades of Rage are a Khorne Warband that took part in the First War of Armageddon.
Born of Iron	The Born of Iron are an Iron Warriors Warband, that was led by the Chaos Lord Hargoron. Under his command, the Warband ventured into the Gorgon's Shroud region of the Eye of Terror for loot and plunder. This would increase the strength the Born of Iron commanded and allow Hargoron to make changes to the Warband, so that it better served him. At that time, the Chaos Lord thought the Born of Iron were vagabonds who were only loyal to power or opportunity. With the riches from the Gorgon's Shroud, however, Hargoron could commission the creation of new Chaos Space Marines, that would be strictly loyal to him. With the Warp Ghosts serving as their guides, the Warband successfully filled its holds with plunder. However even with their help, the journey within the Gorgon's Shroud took a heavy toll on the Born of Iron. Their bodies, power armor and three warships became decayed or rusted, due to the region being cursed with entropy. One of the Warband's warships had to later be abandoned, after it began rapidly decaying. However as the Born of Iron began leaving the region, the goods they had taken from the Gorgon's Shroud had more than paid for the losses they sufferd. One of the items they recovered, though, was a Xenos' skeleton that was sought after by the Thousand Sons Exiles Warband. This led them to ambush the Born of Iron and launch an attack on its flagship's bridge, where Hargoron had command. After leaving the bridge open to the void, the Exiles' Sorcerer Lord Ahriman materialized next to the Chaos Lord. Hargoron was then prevented from moving by the powerful Sorcerer, who tore apart his memories for the Xenos' location. After finding it, Ahriman left the bridge to recover the skeleton and Hargoron was now a dead crumpled heap on the floor.
Daemon	Daemons, also known as Neverborn, are entities of the Warp, and servants of the Gods of Chaos. They are created at the whim of a Chaos god from a fraction of the god's own power and act as an extension of their will. A daemon's appearance and character reflect the god's own nature. These daemons may be reabsorbed into the god at whim. Daemons are the creation of the Gods of Chaos, formed from their own essences. Of a somewhat different nature than their masters, they are the most numerous of the Warp's inhabitants and are thought to be near-infinite in number. A Daemon is "born" when a Chaos God expends a portion of its power to create a separate being, binding a collection of senses, thoughts, and purposes together. This essentially creates a consciousness and personality that can move within the Warp. The Chaos God can reclaim this form at any time, and this ensures the loyalty of the Daemon. Not all Daemons act entirely in accord with their masters, but even the greatest of them would not dare outright defiance. Though it may appear to be made of matter in the Materium, within the Warp a Daemon is no more physical than the rest of the Realm of Chaos.[16a] Though Daemons eternally wage the Great Game against their counterparts of the other Chaos Gods within the Warp, they are known to unite when the interests of the Chaos gods align. Faced with the prospect of claiming mortal souls and spreading Chaos within the Materium, Daemonic armies will put aside their differences for a time to fight a greater foe.[16a]
Unsung	The Unsung is an Alpha Legion Warband. The Unsung is a Harrow (cell) of the Alpha Legion since the time of the Great Scouring. The one-hundred legionnaires force got stranded on Bloodforge, a Daemon World where other Chaos warriors are battling for supremacy. Despite the losses, the Alpha Legionnaires manage to destroy all enemies and to maintain their own largely untainted. 10,000 years have passed in the material universe, but in the Warp, the legionnaires experience only a few years and are mostly unaware of what happened to the Imperium after the ending of the Horus Heresy. After the opening of the Great Rift, Lord Excrucias, a champion of the Emperor’s Children offered the remaining members of the Unsung to help them leave the planet if they vowed to accomplish a mission for him on the ocean planet of Tsadrekha. By the end of the mission, most members of the Unsung are killed in action, but the remaining ones are able to escape with a spaceship and the aim to replenish their ranks.
The Sanctified	The Sanctified are a group of Chaos Space Marines, formerly of the Word Bearers, who splintered from the Legion shortly after the end of the Horus Heresy. They are now associated with the World Eaters legion and the Chaos God Khorne.[3c] When the Word Bearers Legion fled to the Eye of Terror at the end of the Horus Heresy, there were several commanders who refused to retreat. One such warrior was Helman Brisch, a Lieutenant-Commander. With troops loyal to him, Brisch formed The Sanctified and vowed to continue the Word Bearers' dark crusade to bring the worship of Chaos to all of the worlds of the Imperium. Though Brisch was slain in the 32nd millennium, his acolytes have continued his cause, recruiting the most fervent Chaos Space Marines from those warbands they encounter. The Sanctified have an uncanny ability to locate newly-founded colonies and Explorator fleets in wilderness space and have preyed on these targets for 10,000 years.
Exquisite Host	The Exquisite Host are a Slaanesh-affiliated Chaos Space Marine warband. They are known to have taken place in the 13th Black Crusade.
Bringers of Decay	The Bringers of Decay are a warband of the Black Legion which worships Nurgle. Under the control of Skyrak Slaughterborn, this faction is popular within the Black Legion and have converted many to their cause. In battle, they serve as Abaddon's plague carriers and biological warfare specialists, often appearing as heralds to invasion to spread disease. Because of their repugnant, diseased state, few other factions within the Warband have anything to do with the Bringers of Decay. They took part in the Diamor Campaign as a part of the Hand of Xorphas — the army of the Chaos Sorcerer Xorphas.
Forgemaws	The Forgemaws are an Iron Warriors Warband. They are among the Traitor Legion's forces, that have pledged ritualized oaths to the Effacers of Medrengard Warsmith Czagra. This has placed the Forgemaws under his command and they are currently among Czagra's hordes taking part in Abaddon the Despoiler's Ark of Omen Campaign.

The Word Bearers, originally known as the Imperial Heralds and the Iconoclasts, is the XVII Legion of the original twenty Space Marine Legions. They were the first of the nine Legions which betrayed the Emperor, becoming the first known Chaos Space Marines, pledging their allegiance to their Primarch Lorgar and to Chaos Undivided. Known for their extreme religious fervor even before their conversion to Chaos, the Word Bearers are some of the most fanatical Chaos Marines, notable for using Dark Apostles, a corrupted version of Space Marine Chaplains, to inspire their Marines and their cultist allies in battle.
Magma Hounds	The Magma Hounds are a Chaos Space Marine warband. Originally known as the Knights Excelsior, they were lost and corrupted during the Abyssal Crusade. During the Crusade, in the Void Galathamar, the Knights Excelsior fought desperately against Daemon Engines on the distorted and disorientating world of Temporia. When they eventually managed to escape back to their ships, the Warpsmith Valadrak created an electricity-Daemon and set it loose upon the Knights' fleet. The Machine Spirits of the Space Marines' ships rebelled, and with their fleet in disarray the Knights were overrun by pursuing Daemon Engines. Less then a year later, the renegade Magma Hounds emerged. The Magma Hounds have since been seen in the War of Beasts on Vigilus, attempting to capture the Omnissian Hoist space elevator from both Mechanicum and Genestealer Cult forces.
Dolorous Gnaw	The Dolorous Gnaw are a Death Guard Vectorium of the 3rd Plague Company and are among those that contain a high number of Noxious Blightbringers. They were among the Death Guard's forces that took part in the Chromyd Front, under the command of the Chaos Lord Thraxoplasmox. During that battle, the Dolorous Gnaw invaded the Industrial World Okharium and laid siege to the vital Ferrumore Prefabricum XIX. With the aid of the Pus Brothers and the Putrid Choir Vectoriums, the Ferrumore was under the Death Guard's firm stranglehold despite its Imperial forces preventing them from fully claiming it. However their hold was later decisively broken by an assault led by the Blood Vipers Captain Xanthin Atris, which allowed fresh Imperial forces to reach the Ferrumore.
Bonescar	The Bonescar are a World Eaters Warband. They clashed with the Flesh Tearers on Vetix IV, but the Chapter defeated the Bonescar and broke the Warband's back in a final battle that became known as the Bloodiron Charge.

Effacers of Medrengard	The Effacers of Medrengard are an Iron Warriors Warband, who are led by the Warsmith Czagra. They are all brutally efficient siege masters, and most of the Warband are cold-hearted veterans of the Long War, who have helped Czagra destroy and conquer for millennia. The Effacers are also marked by their arcane cybernetic augmentations and for being at the head, in both favor and power, of the various Chaos forces, that serve the Warsmith. However, while Czagra willingly embraced the power the Chaos Gods offered, he was adamant that they were merely tools to be used in his war against the Imperium. As such, few of the Effacers openly worship the Chaos Gods, but individual devotees of each were not unknown, with the largest being devotees of Khorne. The Warsmith also allows Possessed Chaos Marines in the Warband, but he will kill any who fall to the beguilement of Daemons. In doing so, Czagra uses their deaths as an example to what happens to those who dare exchange his authority to the beings of the Warp. Aiding the Warsmith in enforcing his will upon the Warband, is the Effacers' insane Master of Executions and Chaos Champion, Kahrbol Mandrax. The Warband also contain the elite vanguard shock troops known as the Bronzewrought, who serve as Czagra's bodyguards as well. Only those who show the most single-minded devotion to destruction are permitted to join these Chosen and Chaos Terminators, who are led by the Warsmith's favored lieutenant Vurnok. Because of their relentless hatred, discipline and martial skill, the Bronzewrought almost operate as a separate Warband and Czagra sends them on specialist missions that are unknown to the rest of the Effacers. They all also bear a representation of the bronze claw the Warmsmith wields, as either an augmetic gauntlet, an inscribed sigil or a metallic icon.
Invocators	The Invocators are a Chaos Space Marine warband. Originally known as the Clerics of Steel, they were among the thirty Chapters corrupted during the Abyssal Crusade. Known for the daemonic hosts they summon before each battle, the Invocators are a rag-tag assortment of minor warbands that now seek power through bringing as many daemonic rituals to fruition as they can. They have fallen so far from the light of truth that their only recourse is to court the favour of all four of the Ruinous Powers – and some rumour other gods besides.
Drowned Lords	The Drowned Lords are a Death Guard Warband, who are obsessed with waterborne pathogens. They are part of Typhus the Traveler's Plague Fleet and he will occasionally fight alongside the Warband.

Brothers of Anarchy	The Brothers of Anarchy are a Khorne Warband, whose forces are the size of an army. They fought in the Dominion of Fire, where they took part in the Siege of Fortress Secundex. The Imperium Fortress had withstood numerous attacks from the Daemon Prince Angron's forces, until he finally ordered the Brothers of Anarchy to destroy the Fortress no matter the cost or they would be destroyed at his hands. In order to complete their task, the Warband and their Cult allies, threw themselves at the Fortress countless times, as the Imperium's forces within it fired upon them, in order to allow their Vindicators a chance to breach a section of its walls. This went on for three days, until the Vindicators finally created a breach, that allowed the Warband and their Cults to flood into the Fortress and destroy both it and the Imperium's forces inside. Though the Fortress' sacking cost the Warband hundreds of lives and their Cults in the thousands, Angron was sated and the Dominon of Fire went on to rage onwards against the Imperium for several more decades.
Carrion Hounds	The Carrion Hounds are a Death Guard Warband. The Warband holds a great affection for the shambling Poxwalkers and often assembles morbid collections of the infected souls, usually from defeated Imperial Guard Regiments or entire noble families. During a battle, the Carrion Hounds will unleash hordes of their Poxwalkers to screen the Warband's advance.
Putrid Choir	The Putrid Choir are a Death Guard Vectorium of the 3rd Plague Company. Their specialisation the defensive warfare, once they've captured a key strategic point—ideally one that supplies water, air, sustenance or spiritual strength—they fortify the area, deploying Miasmic Malignifiers to saturate the surroundings with their pervasive corruption. True to their name, they broadcast unending death-dirges through blaring vox-systems and hammer plague bells relentlessly. This auditory torment erodes the enemy's sanity, triggering fevered agony and impulsive assaults that inevitably break upon the Choir’s impregnable lines. The warriors of the Putrid Choir's march to battle, is always signalled by the baleful toll of their tocsins of misery. Accompanying this maddening percussion is the sound of scores of the Warband's diseased throats bellowing discordant battle dirges in honour of Grandfather Nurgle.
Darkstrike	The Darkstrike are a Night Lords Chaos Raptor Cult. They serve in the Dreadmaster's Warband and the Darkstrike have the honour of being the vanguard of his attacks.
Bloodborn	The Bloodborn was a Chaos army gathered for the Invasion of Ultramar in late 999.M41. The name was granted by M'kar the Reborn, to the resentment of Warsmith Honsou.[1b] Following the destruction of most of his Grand Company on Medrengard by Captain Uriel Ventris and Sergeant Pasanius Lysane, Warsmith Honsou of the Iron Warriors set about building a force needed to destroy all Ventris held dear. After destroying Tarsis Ultra, Honsou took his lieutenant Cadaras Grendel, renegade Raven Guard Ardaric Vaanes, and the Newborn, a clone of Ventris, to New Badab to participate in the Skull Harvest, a competition between rival warbands and pirate groups where the victor would gain dominion over the losers. Honsou and his lieutenants were able to secure victory, giving Honsou a force of 17,000. Following this, Honsou was able to reach Morianna, the damned seer of Abaddon the Despoiler, who told him of M'kar and his imprisonment on the Indomitable by Marneus Calgar, the Chapter Master of the Ultramarines. After an invasion the star fort and a brief but bloody siege on it main bastion, M'kar was freed and assumed a joint command with Honsou over his army, and named them the Bloodborn. Following this, Honsou was ready to launch his attack.[1a] Although the Invasion was defeated, it would be another six months before the Bloodborn's taint would be expunged from Ultramar, and they cost the Chapter 347 battle-brothers across the ten companies.[1c]
Infested Brethren	The Infested Brethren are a Death Guard Warband of the 6th Plague Company. The Warband has dedicated themselves to capturing Imperial vessels and turning them into disease vectors to spread pestilence throughout the galaxy. Once they learned about the Seventh Blackstone Fortress, the Infested Brethren realized its power could make their virulent gifts even more potent and set out in their Cruiser, the Cyst of Sorrow, to find it. The Warband later succeeded and went about their task with glee, with their horde of Poxwalkers, creating three daemonic diseases, which soon spread to the nearby Precipice. The first of these, known as the Bleeding Maw, left sufferers unable to heal any wounds suffered. The Mouldering imbues hostiles within the Blackstone Fortress with the blessings of Nurgle, making them hardier. The final plague is the most unusual, known as the Chronopox, it gathers together afflictions that the host has or could possibly have suffered in any of their possible pasts or futures.
Fifteen Fangs	The Fifteen Fangs were a small warband of World Eaters that existed after the Battle of Skalathrax. Based from the warship Jaws of the White Hound under the control of Lheorvine Ukris and his Sergeant Ugrivian, it allied with Falkus Kibre and later Ezekyle Abaddon to exact revenge against the Emperor's Children in the Battle of Harmony.[1a] By this point, the warband numbered 6 warriors who were all killed by a clone of Horus during the closing stages of the battle.[1b]

The Brothers of Retaliation is a Chaos Warband that was created on the Planet of Sorcerers a thousand years after the death of Horus, for the sole purpose of avenging the fate the Imperium inflicted upon the Thousand Sons with its betrayal of the Legion during the Horus Heresy. Led by the Chaos Lord Laudren Thalarn, a member of the Thousand Sons and survivor of the Horus Heresy, the Brothers of Retaliation were originally composed of his loyal followers amongst the Legion, but Thalarn has since drawn many different forces to his banner throughout the millennia. Now swollen with hundreds of Chaos Space Marines, thousands of Cultists and the aid of two Daemon Princes, the Brothers of Retaliation strike at the Imperium from the Black Cathedral, a vast Fortress located on a Crone World that serves as the Warband's Homeworld.

Blood Wolves	The Blood Wolves are a warband of Chaos Space Marines that were once a Great Company of the mighty Space Wolves. Following their corrupted leader, Svane Vulfbad, these once-proud warriors are sworn to the service of Khorne. The Blood Wolves were once the Great Company of Svane Vulfbad, Wolf Lord of the Space Wolves Space Marine Chapter. He became so disillusioned with the grinding workings and soul-killing bureaucracy of the Imperium that he and his Company turned to the worship of Chaos, and more particularly to the faith of the Blood God Khorne. In 913.M41 the Wolf Lord Harald Deathwolf and his Great Company were charged by the Great Wolf Logan Grimnar to track down and execute the notorious Traitor warband and their leader. Deathwolf and his company eventually located Vulfbad in the Cliedes System, tracking their elusive quarry to the storm-wracked moon of Gallimius. Deathwolf rode his ferocious Thunderwolf through the planet's ferrite dust storms at the head of a small strike force of Wolf Scouts. The visibility was so bad that Deathwolf had to track his quarry purely by scent, but he later claimed the stink of rank sweat and treachery was so strong it was child's play to follow.
Fear Rakers	The Fear Rakers are a powerful Night Lords warband. Active in the Nachmund Gauntlet region, the warband under their leader Nethar the Chainflayer allied itself to the forces of Abaddon the Despoiler during the Nachmund Rift War.

Ever since, they have been led by the Sorcerer Nezchad Aratos and have grown into a sizable force.[1a] In late M41, Aratos and his Warband were recruited by Ahriman to aid Magnus in his invasion of the Space Wolves Chapter's homeworld, Fenris.[1b] The invasion was ultimately defeated by the Space Wolves and their allies, but Aratos and the Warp Gheists would escape the Imperium's wrath.[1c] Sometime later though, Aratos began a revivification ritual to return the Rubric Marines in his Warband to their true forms — but only succeeded in restoring their skeletons and killing himself in the process. After the Sorcerer's death, the Warp Gheists began to wander the galaxy aimlessly.[1a]
Scarlet Ritual	The Scarlet Ritual is a Word Bearers Warhost, that is led by a Dark Apostle and is aided by Traitor Guard forces.

However Defence Station 57Θ 'Star Breaker' was one of the Orbital Defense Batteries built into the Hive, that was able to resist the Death Guard's efforts to capture it. This ended, though, after the Heralds of the Fly's Lord of Contagion and Terminators were teleported into the heart of Defence Station 57Θ. The Imperial forces defending it, under the PDF General Barphemius Dyroch's command, were caught by surprise and were no match for the Heralds' might. Soon the General was slain by the Lord of Contagion and without his leadership, Defence Station 57Θ finally fell to the Heralds.

Eight Stolen Truths	The Eight Stolen Truths are a Alpha Legion Warband.
Encrusted Blade	I saw constant battle. Man fought Daemon. Lightning fought volcano. Geysers of molten brass fought lakes of steaming blood. There was no respite, no peace. That which emerged victorious was immediately set upon by another foe even more terrible. It was blood, spraying and jetting, and skulls adding to a throne that pierced the red skies. It was endless screams of rage and fury made incarnate. It was... glorious. — Desark Slet, vision-geist of the Encrusted Blade[1a] The Encrusted Blade are a Khorne Warband that practice blood-rites.

The Shadowkin currently operate out of the asteroids that orbit[1a] the Nomad World Dhorakagan. Through means they do not understand, the world periodically vanishes and then reappears in another location, taking its asteroids and the Warband with it. The Shadowkin's warships strike at every System Dhorakagan passes near and they are safe from any easy retribution, as the world is never in the same place twice. Dhorakagan is following a path, however, which will eventually take the Warband into the Imperium Nihilus.[1b]
The Consortium	The Consortium was a Traitor Legion Warband based on Crone World Urum. A second facility was planned on Belial IV.[2b] The Consortium is a warband of affiliated Chaos Space Marine Apothecaries from various Legions under the command of Fabius Bile. Formed in the aftermath of the shattering of the Emperor's Children on Harmony, the only thing that unites members of the Consortium is an interest in fleshcrafting and scientific pursuit; members enjoy a great deal of autonomy, and Bile encourages individual ambition so long as it poses no risk to his goals. Internecine conflict is common and even encouraged to a degree, and members of the Consortium will raid and even murder each other when Bile is absent. The Consortium's base was on the Crone World Urum in the Eye of Terror. At its zenith the Consortium numbered over 200, but departures and internal unrest reduced its numbers.[5e] Following its participation in the 12th Millennial's attack of the Craftworld Lugganath, the remains of the 12th Millennial, become subservent to Bile and operated as a semi-subservient sister warband during the journey to Solemnace and afterwards.[4a] During Bile's sojourn in Commorragh, a civil war broke out that forced the facilities on Urum to be abandoned.[5a] Later, following the defeat on Peleus-Tertius, the majority of the remaining Consortium members ransacked the facilities on Belial IV and went their separate ways, with only a loyal few remaining at Bile's side. While Bile had originally allowed internal conflict as per his 'survival of the fittest' ethos, he later came to regret allowing so much of what he had built to fall apart due through neglect.[5e]
The Bloodspawned	The Bloodspawned are a Khorne Warband that has an intense rivalry with the Nurgle Warband the Tallymen.
Coven of the One Change	The Coven of the One Change are a Tzeentch affiliated Chaos Space Marine warband active in the Choraplex. Based out of the Asteroid 0031A859F, they have turned it into a den of sorcery.
Brethren of the Fly	The Brethren of the Fly are a Death Guard Warband.
First Claw	The phrase "First Claw" (or 1st Claw) is itself a simple squad designation used by the Night Lords Chaos Space Marine Legion of unknown derivation; exactly why the word ‘claw’ is used instead of ‘squad’ is unknown, though given the high use of Nostraman terms within the legion and the difficulty in translating that dead language into Low Gothic, it may just be a simple translation result, rather than anything more deliberately metaphorical. Regardless, this squad designation, while in possible use in all Night Lords units that still operate using Legion organisational schemes, in most recorded instances worth noting refers to one particular First Claw: 1st Claw, 10th Company, once of The Exalted's warband, later of the warband of Talos Valcoran. The early history of the First Claw of Tenth Company is not clearly known at this point in time, much of their deeds during the Great Crusade and the Horus Heresy currently unrecorded, although at least a few members were present for some of the former and all of the latter.[2a]
Mortarion	"I am not like you. I do not wallow in this corruption. I use it. I control it. I set bounds on it"[13a] Mortarion (also known as the Death Lord, The Pale King, or the Reaper of Men[17a]) was one of the original twenty Primarchs. He was given command of the Death Guard Legion on the arrival of the Emperor to his world of Barbarus but turned to the forces of Chaos during the Horus Heresy. The only consistent information regarding Mortarion and his homeworld come from a single source: the Stygian Scrolls of Lackland Thorn, a historian and polymath attached to the explorator fleet that discovered Barbarus.[6b]
Jade Talons	The Jade Talons are a Chaos Space Marine Chapter, which is descended from the White Scars. They were once a humble pragmatic loyal Space Marine Chapter, who embodied the hunter in all its aspects and were avid trophy-takers of skulls. However the Jade Talons also harbored a secret desire to be reunited with their Primarch Jaghatai Khan, which they shared with their Founding Chapter, the White Scars. So when a figure claiming to be a Primarch appeared in M33, the Jade Talons believed he was Jaghatai Khan and willing joined the other Imperial forces who flocked to his side. This led to the War of the False Primarch and though the Jade Talons had thought they had finally found Jaghatai Khan, they were sadly mistaken. Their false hope led them to be among the Space Marine Chapters who were declared Traitoris Perdita by the Imperium. When the False Primarch was finally defeated, the Jade Talons had been nearly destroyed during the conflict and began to splinter. While some of the shamed survivors left the Chapter to become Pirates, other Jade Talons fell to Chaos. This included their Chapter Master Sah'Al-Zhar, who reformed those Jade Talons that followed him into servants of the Chaos Gods. Though it was done out of desperation, the Jade Talons sacrificed their principles in order to survive their downfall and also gained a new purpose to replace what they lost. Despite their heresy, however, the Jade Talons still share the same attributes they had as a Loyalist Chapter. This includes their pragmatism, hunter instincts and avid trophy-taking of skulls. The Jade Talons also continue to hope they will find their missing Primarch Jaghatai Khan, and the Chapter's Huntsworn Kyndred Company has been charged with doing so. Also in the millennia since their downfall, Sah'Al-Zhar's road to damnation has recently led him to become a Daemon Prince
Great Scouring	The Great Scouring was the Imperium's counter-offensive against the rebel armies of Horus, following the defeat of the Horus Heresy in c.M31. Horus's campaign to strike towards Terra to achieve a quick and decisive victory had ultimately been defeated. The rebels were broken and in retreat, and Imperial forces now had the job of reacquiring all the territory they had captured. The Great Scouring saw the first mass galaxy-wide purge carried out by the Imperium as it sought to erase the taint of Horus's treachery from its realm. Before actually being confined within the Golden Throne, the Emperor had pronounced judgment on the rebels: they were to be driven into the hellish region of the Eye of Terror, which would hold them for all eternity. All records and memory of the Traitor Legions were to be expunged from the Imperial archives. Worlds such as Isstvan V and Davin would be scoured and the Traitors' associated troops were to be destroyed or driven into the Eye. It would be as if the Traitor Legions never existed. Meanwhile since the death of Horus, the Traitor Legions had become splintered and dispersed. Fighting continued for another seven years before the rebels were wholly destroyed or exiled. The Imperium fought not only the traitors but also Xenos that had taken advantage of the turmoil caused by the Heresy to plunder human worlds. Systems once thought unassailable to the Xenos threat were put under siege. During the campaign, loyalist forces realized the sheer scale of Chaos influence in the Imperium as world after world was discovered to have traitor presence. Many corrupted systems were cleansed and placed under the watch of the Inquisition. Horus's death had not ended the fighting, it had renewed the loyalists against the rebels. Many worlds during the Heresy had refused to commit their forces to either side, or seceded entirely. Such indecision was punished by loyalist and rebel alike. These forces were bled white attacking rebel strongholds. Meanwhile, the Legions destroyed at the Drop Site Massacre were slowly reestablished using what little gene-seed the survivors had managed to escape with.
Fleshreavers	The Fleshreavers were a Khorne Warband.
Black Crusade Core Rulebook	The Black Crusade Core Rulebook was first published in 2011 by Fantasy Flight Games and it contains the core rules for the Warhammer 40,000 Black Crusade Role-Playing Game System. The book also contains a large amount of new background material, with an over-riding focus on the Screaming Vortex.
Brazen Butchers	The Brazen Butchers are a World Eaters Warband. Considering themselves Khorne's most devoted followers, they go to battle with massed infantry charges in classic World Eaters fashion. They seek to shatter the veil of reality and summon Khorne's realm through mass indiscriminate killing and are known to enthusiastically collude with Daemons. To that end, they are particularly eager to gather the skulls of their foes to use them in rituals to the Blood God. After battle, they ritually cleanse their armour of accumulated gore and dried blood in preparation for the next battle. The Brazen Butchers are known to have taken part in the Season of Blood.
Coven of Many Eyes	The Coven of Many Eyes are a Tzeentch Warband, composed entirely of Sorcerers. They took part in the Invasion of the Stygius Sector and were among Tzeentch's forces that invaded the Imperial world Mordian.
Sons of the Hydra	The Sons of the Hydra was a major Alpha Legion coalition and warband led by the Arch-Lord and Harrowmaster Quetzel Carthach.[1c] This warband had a dark reputation and its warriors are known as vicious butchers.[1b] Sons of the Hydra were a prominent force that brought together several Alpha Legion warbands to wage war upon the successor sons of Guilliman in the Maelstrom Zone. As such, they assailed the forces of the Nova Legion, Crimson Consuls, Vindicators and Marines Mordant in their campaigns. However, the warband broke apart shortly after defeating the Marines Mordant, as Quetzel Carthach and sub-commander Occam turned on each other. A large part of the warband was killed in this clash, with Carthach presumed dead; the survivors of the coalition subsequently divided and returned to waging their own wars.[1a] Quetzel Carthach later resurfaced, and attempted to take revenge on Occam. However, he and his last loyalists were slain when an assassin belonging to The Redacted sabotaged the Q-Ship Iota-Æternus's Gellar Field, whereupon Carthach's forces were torn apart by Daemons.[1b][1e] The Sons of the Hydra didn't just employ Chaos Space Marine and typical Heretic Astartes followers such as Cultists and Operatives. They also employed large numbers of alien fighters and mercenaries such as Tarellians, Morralians, Galg, Fra'al, Sslyths, and Eldar outcasts.[1c]
The Scourged	The Scourged are a Chaos Space Marine warband that follow the Chaos God Tzeentch. Blessed by Tzeentch, the Scourged are said to hear every lie spoken by man. Though this gives them unparalleled knowledge, it eventually drives them all mad with the constant voices in their heads. Originally a Space Marine Chapter working for the Inquisition known as the Seekers of Truth, the Seekers and their Chapter Master, Gallus Herodicus, were being drained of their morale through excessive orders by the Inquisition to murder innocents. Herodicus would pray each night to gain the power to know when a man was lying so that he may only kill the guilty. However, Tzeentch was listening and granted his prayer. From that moment on, Herodicus and his men could hear every lie spoken by mankind. The Chapter went rogue within days from the insanity when they realized how many falsehoods existed in the Imperium they were serving. Since going rogue, the Chapter's battlecry has become "The lies, the lies, the lies..."
Phoenix Conclave	The Phoenix Conclave are a group of the leaders of several Emperor's Children Warbands. The Phoenix Conclave is a group of affiliated Chaos Space Marine warband leaders, aimed at restoring the Legion to its former glory and awaiting the return of Fulgrim to the Legion. Eidolon secretly allied the group to Ezekyle Abaddon's Black Legion, joining their expeditions out of the Eye of Terror.[2b] The Conclave is based in the Legion's old base on Harmony in the Eye of Terror.[2a] Members wore pristine white robes with hoods over their armour, threaded with gold. Some wore golden daemon masks.[2a]
Epidemius	Epidemius is Nurgle's chosen Tallyman and one of the seven Proctors of Pestilence who preside over the Plaguebearers. He is charged with cataloguing the potency of Nurgle's many diseases, and is constantly moving through both Daemon and mortal worlds, seeking out new strands of virus, fresh species of bacteria, and innovative symptoms of contagion. Epidemius rides on a rotten palanquin borne aloft by Nurglings. The Nurglings also serve as his guards, and act as his assistants by secreting ink for his quill, growing parchment-like strips of skin from their backs that could then be torn free, and counting on a death's head abacus on the back of the palanquin. Unlike the constant babbling and giggles of usual Nurglings, however, these are silent, as they understand the importance of Epidemius's task, and suffer his ire whenever they break his concentration. Even as Epidemius surveys and takes notes of the spread of filth and decay, Nurgle becomes aware of his learnings, and distills the information for future experiments and brews. For this reason, Epidemius focuses on his task even in the midst of battle, for if he were to make an error or untimely observation, Nurgle's anger would be dire indeed.
Iconoclastic Brotherhood	The Iconoclastic Brotherhood are a Chaos Space Marine warband of the Word Bearers. Their most notable act is the War of Statues, but they also are known to have taken part in the Nachmund Rift War.

The novella also includes the illustrated short story Helion Rain. Only three thousand copies of this collectors’ edition novella were printed, and was released in May 2012. Captain Daed and his Brazen Minotaurs fight a hopeless battle on a vital world, assaulting an impenetrable fortress held by their treacherous foes. When help arrives in the form of the Raven Guard, commanded by Daed's old ally, Captain Koryn, the Imperial forces finally have a chance of victory. But can the subtle stealth forces of the Raven Guard and the bold, brash Brazen Minotaurs work together, or will they all be doomed?
Hollow Ghouls	The Hollow Ghouls are a Chaos Warband, that took part in the Charadon Campaign. During that conflict, the Warband and the Night Lords invaded the planet Laboritum and started to corrupt it. However they were unable to completely seize the world, as it was defended by Astra Militarum Regiments and Skitarii forces. When the Indomitus Crusade's Battle Group Tarsus arrived, though, it dispatched an Order of the Bloody Rose strike force to cleanse the world and everyone on it. The Adepta Sororitas were aided in their task by Lieutenant Aglepus' Ultramarines forces
Pallid Raptors	The Pallid Raptors are an Emperor's Children Warband, that controls a cluster of worlds.
Harbingers of Destruction	The Harbingers of Destruction are a Khorne Warband, formed by an alliance of Chaos Space Marines from the Black Legion and World Eaters.

Grand Guard	The Grand Guard are a Chaos Space Marine Warband. Some time after the Great Rift's creation, the Grand Guard were defeated in battle with the Ork Freebooterz of Kaptin Badrukk.
The Brotherhood	The Brotherhood is an internal sect within the Word Bearers Legion. It has been formed three times, the first two at the explicit order of the Primarch Lorgar, and the third at the order of Kor Phaeron. Each time its purpose was to purge the legion's ranks. Lorgar is noted to have been mournful and acted with great reluctance every time he was forced to form the Brotherhood.[1x] The first purge occurred prior to Colchis being united with the Imperium, to purge the ranks of the Covenant of those who were swaying from the will of Lorgar. Fully a third of the population of Colchis was slaughtered.[1a] The second purge occurred around a century after the first, following Lorgar's secret betrayal of the Emperor. The Brotherhood was reformed in order to purge the legion's ranks of all Terran Astartes, who unfortunately had become corrupted from their initial isolation from their Primarch and were too deeply infected with the lies of the False Emperor.[1a]
Grey Death	The Grey Death are a Chaos Space Marine warband. Originally known as the Iron Drakes, they were among the thirty Chapters corrupted during the Abyssal Crusade. During the Crusade, the Iron Drakes' fleet was crippled by the Death Guard near the world of Anathrax, marooning the Space Marines on the Nurgle-devoted world. For an entire century, the Iron Drakes waged a guerrilla war against the Death Guard on Anathrax, with the latter deliberately choosing not to quickly kill them in battles to let them suffer from wounds and the loss of their equipment. Harried by the diseased-ridden living vegetation and Plague Marines of the world, half of the Iron Drakes mutated into screaming fungus-trees. The remainder surrendered, devoted themselves to Nurgle and became the Grey Death. Eventually, the Grey Death remerged from the Eye of Terror and started to raid the Imperium, intending to spread plagues far and wide.
Hound's Jaws	The Hound's Jaws are a World Eaters Warband.

Emissaries of the Wasting Death	The Emissaries of the Wasting Death are a Nurgle Warband that is active in the Screaming Vortex. The Warband is composed of Plague Marines and is feared amongst the many denizens of the Screaming Vortex, for their very presence brings with it untold suffering and privation. Wherever the Emissaries of the Wasting Death tread, the ground shrivels and cracks beneath their feet and even the heartiest and most resilient creatures shrivel and perish as they draw near. Contact with the malefic air of deprivation that surrounds these desiccated warriors irreparably scars those who survive, often manifesting in incessant pangs of unquenchable thirst and indescribable hunger that lasts for years after their dreadful encounter with the Warband is a distant memory.
Ironhydras	The Ironhydras are an Alpha Legion warband which took part in the Nachmund Rift War.
Raptorous Flayhost	The Raptorous Flayhost are a Night Lords Warband led by the Daemon Prince Jago. Its members were born on Nostramo and they are true veterans of the Long War. As Jago's most hated enemies are the Howling Griffons, this is shared by the Flayhost and the Chapter's helmets are particularly collected by the Warband's Chaos Terminators as trophies. Also, since the Daemon Prince's soul is being fought over by Slaanesh and Tzeentch, the Chaos God the Flayhost serves changes frequently. In battle they make good use of the Warband's Warp Talons and the Night Lords' Vox Scream strategy. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Fulgrim's Song	Fulgrim's Song are an Emperor's Children warband of pirates and Daemon-worshippers.

Explosive carnage broke out as the two war-hungry hordes collided head on, but the Warband was massively outnumbered and wiped out by the Waaagh! within days. Despite their deaths, the oceans of blood the Fists of Brass spilled during the battle drew eight legions of Khorne's Daemons into reality, which soon fell upon the Orks and started the battle anew.
Scaled Fang	The Scaled Fang is an Alpha Legion warband which took part in the Nachmund Rift War.
Davok's Destroyers	Davok's Destroyers are a small Iron Warriors Warband of elite killers. They are led by a Havoc Champion, who dominates his Warband with his rank and by force. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
The Chosen of Heiros	The Chosen of Heiros are a Chaos Space Marine Warband that is active in the Screaming Vortex. The warband is composed of sadistic killers, who were each once numbered amongst Abaddon's mightiest warriors in the Black Legion and are responsible for committing countless atrocities during his infamous Black Crusades. Though each has their own reason for abandoning the Despoiler and finding refuge in the Screaming Vortex, they all burn with an unquenchable desire to march to war beneath banners of hate and destruction. Their centuries of experience, ferocious tempers, and predilection towards Daemonic possession and mental instability make them a truly menacing foe to those who encounter them.
Hollow Ones	The Hollow Ones are a relentlessly brutal Death Guard Warband, who took part in the Charadon Campaign.
Blood Gorgons	The Blood Gorgons are a traitor chapter whose actions are localised in the Bastion Sector. They were founded during the Cursed Founding. From the planets they have conquered in the Bastion sector, the Gorgons strike against the Imperium, also protecting those same planets to use as recruiting worlds. Their heraldry is the Gorgon head of old Greek mythology.[Needs Citation] The Blood Gorgons were a product of the 21st "cursed" Founding. Ultimately, under the leadership of their Chapter Master, the Blood Gorgons were declared traitor just 60 years after their creation. What followed next was a period of instability and anarchy for the Chapter as they were driven from their homeworld by the Space Wolves and pursued into the Eye of Terror. Shortly afterwards the Chapter took shelter on the Space Hulk Cauldron Born before descending into bands of warring sub-factions. It was only under the Chaos Lord Gammadin that the Blood Gorgons were reunified. Gammadin introduced a blood-bonding ritual and service to the Ruinous Powers as a means of maintaining unity. However unlike many other Chaos Space Marine factions, the Blood Gorgons are not slaves of Chaos and owe true allegiance to none but themselves. Shortly afterwards, the Blood Gorgons became active in the Bastion Sector. One of the most notable elements of the Blood Gorgons is their blood-rituals process by which two members of the warband become "bond-brothers". The process, derived from Chaotic lore, involves exchanging organs, blood, and tissue between two members. The process can be extremely dangerous due to Daemonic corruption, but in the end both brothers emerge stronger and draw their power from one another.
Vengeance Chapter	The Flylords are a Chaos Space Marine warband. Originally known as the Vengeance Chapter, they were among the thirty Chapters corrupted during the Abyssal Crusade.
Steel Brethren	The Steel Brethren (also Steel Brotherhood) are an Iron Warriors warband.[3b] They were exiled from Medrengard after a bitter conflict with their Legion.

With a promise to gift them victories and sensations like no other, Lucius has led them on a self-indulgent crusade of violence across the Galaxy.
Immortal Legion	The Immortal Legion are a Chaos Space Marine Warband that once possessed fortresses on the twin worlds Corfex and Xefroc. The Warband's fortresses later came under attack by the Imperial Guard and the Angels Vermillion Chapter, but both easily withstood anything that was thrown at them. It was only when the Angels Vermillion's Death Company broke through both fortress's defenses, that the Immortal Legion were finally defeated by the Space Marine Chapter.
Oathed	The Oathed are a Black Legion Warband dedicated to the Chaos God Nurgle.
Magisters of the Burning Amethyst	The Magisters of the Burning Amethyst are a large Chaos Warband.
Garazak's Skullreapers	Garazak's Skullreapers are a World Eaters Warband, that is led by the Chaos Lord Garazak.

A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Grand Order of Hermetic Blades	The Grand Order of Hermetic Blades are a Tzeentch Warband that was originally formed by members of the Thousand Sons Legion that were exiled by their Primarch, Magnus, for aiding in the disastrous Rubric of Ahriman.

The Forge of Hate were part of the Butcherhorde that was led by Khârn and took part in the Black Legion's Diamor Campaign.[1a] However, like all of the Butcherhorde, they were abandoned on Amethal after the Black Legion had completed their objective, and were destroyed, along with their Cult army, by the Imperium's forces defending the world.[1b]
Xenash Capensis' Rubric Phalanx	Xenash Capensis' Rubric Phalanx are a Thousand Sons Warband.
Sevens (Warband)	The Sevens are an elite Death Guard Warband. They have survived thousand of years of warfare and spread disease and decay wherever they go. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Skull-blessed	The Skull-blessed was a World Eaters Warband, that once had great throngs of wretched followers. Their downfall began, when the Warband began pursuing a Kindred of the Leagues of Votann, who began fleeing into the Galactic Core. The Skull-blessed continued to chase their foes, not realizing that the Kindred were nearing their Hold. Once the Kindred reached it though, the Hold's forces began furiously attacking the Warband. The Skull-blessed attacked in return, but more of the Hold's forces arrived and eventually each of the Warband's members were slain. However they had managed to kill nine in ten of the Hold's population and it was left tainted by bloodshed forever after. Now the screams of the dead's souls echo in its corspe-strewn reaches.

It is part of the Imperial Armour serie of books. This volume is the first of 3 to cover the events of the Siege of Vraks campaign. The book introduces the Death Korps of Krieg miniatures and features the Dark Angels against the forces of Chaos
Shriven (Warband)	The Shriven are a Black Legion Warband, that was once the Brazen Drakes Chapter, before they fell to Heresy. Their downfall began, in the wake of the Great Rift's creation, when the Chapter was stricken with the sudden emergence of psychic powers within its ranks. Their Chapter Master, Argento Corian, knew that the High Lords would label the Brazen Drakes as Heretics should they learn of this, and so began personally killing each stricken Battle Brother. This took a toll on Corian, though, and when the stricken Battle Brother Kier was brought before him, the Chapter Master finally refused to carry out anymore executions. He told his inner circle they had bled enough for the Imperium and if they were to be condemned for the emergence of psychic powers, which he had no doubt would afflicted all of them in time, then Corian was determined that the Chapter would fight only for itself from now on. And those of their Chapter who refused to turn their back on the Imperium, would have to be enlightened. This led to a civil war within the Chapter, and their Homeworld, Khassedur, became a warzone between Corian's loyalists and those who refused to follow his commands. A Torchbearers strike force, led by the Adeptus Custodes Shield-Captain Tyvar aboard the Lux-Imperatus, later arrived at Khassedur in order to supply the Brazen Drakes with the gift of Primaris Space Marines. When they discovered the Chapter's traitorous actions, Tyvar declared the Brazen Drakes to be Hereticus Diabolus Extremis and ordered that the two Greyshield Companies that had been sent to reinforce the Chapter were detained. The Greyshields were led by Captain Gerion, who attempted to convince Tyvar that some of the Brazen Drakes could still be loyal and could still fighting to save Khassedur from their Traitorous Brothers. Tyvar was not convinced and after one of Gerion's Greyshields continued to argue that it was not fair they were being judged by the Chapter's actions, the Shield-Captain killed him. This led the Greyshields aboard the Lux-Imperatus to open fire in return and the battle soon spread to rest of the fleet, after Gerion told his Companies that they had been betrayed by the Imperium. The Torchbearers' Adeptus Custodes and Silent Sisters, under the command of Knight-Centura Dessima, were able to quickly kill the Greyshields within the Lux-Imperatus, though the battle still raged aboard the rest of the fleet. Tyvar vowed, however, that his strike force would not rest until they killed every single member of the Brazen Drakes.
Ebon Sentinels	The Ebon Sentinels are a Chaos Space Marine Chapter that was originally loyal to the Imperium. Once lauded as the defenders of the Sunnan Strait, an unrecorded incident saw the Chapter shamed and forced to embark on a 101 year penitent Crusade to restore their honour. This act brought so many worlds back to the Imperial fold that their past sins were forgotten and a plaque was consecrated upon the planet Ophelia VII in their honour. By the time of the Indomitus Crusade the Chapter was assigned as part of the Torchbearer Fleet Conqueror's Forge to help deliver new technologies to the Astral Spears and Condemnors. However at the Manask System the Chapter encountered a millions-year-old Daemon at the core of the Dead World of Vengla which due to the Great Rift had finally begun to break its bindings. The Daemon exploited the Chapter's deepest regrets and insecurities regarding their past shame and dishonour, promising a swift and glorious renewal if they pledged themselves to it. The Ebon Sentinels fell under the influence of the creature, with many becoming Possessed in the process. The Grey Knights were forced to purge the traitors at the Battle of Manask.
Poisoned Chalice	The Poisoned Chalice are a Death Guard Warband. Led by deranged groups of Chaos Space Marines, the Poisoned Chalice zealously rampages across the galaxy in their quest to brew the perfect plague. This has led them to obsessively seek vile ingredients and hapless test subjects in order to complete their goal. The Poisoned Chalice took part in the Charadon Campaign and were among the Chaos forces that invaded the Metalica System. There, they attacked Ohmex Magnifica and secretly infiltrated a Corpse-Starch processing centre. The Warband was eager to corrupt it with Nurgle's gifts, but they were attacked by a Corpse Grinder Cult that worked there. These blood crazed Cultists worshiped the Lord of Bone and Tendon and viciously fought to destroy the Poisoned Chalice. Their battle, however, drew the attention of the Imperium's forces defending Ohmex Magnifica, which attacked them. As they were already weakened from fighting each other, the Poisoned Chalice and the Corpse Grinder Cult were soon destroyed by the Imperium.
Brotherhood of Dust	The Brotherhood of Dust was a Chaos Space Marine warband led by Amon of the Thousand Sons. The Brotherhood of Dust was created by Amon after his exile from the Thousand Sons. This warband mainly consisted of exiled Thousand Sons but not entirely.[1a] Amon's aim was to destroy his own Legion, releasing them from the eternal damnation caused by the Rubric of Ahriman. In order to reverse the Rubric, he needed Ahriman's knowledge of it.[1b] Amon dispersed The Brotherhood of Dust throughout the galaxy to search for Ahriman. One of these emissaries, Tolbek, crossed paths with a Space Wolf band also hunting the Thousand Sons, and from its last survivor, extracted the name of a warband with which Ahriman was traveling, The Harrowing, under an assumed name. Amon's searches inevitably turned up other sorcerers, who were given a choice: join the Brotherhood or die fighting.[1c] [1d]
Fulgrim	"Perfection is not a state of being, It is a state of striving. The journey is all that has meaning, not the goal" Fulgrim (also known as the Phoenician, the Illuminator, the Prefector of Chemos)[6a] is the Primarch of the Emperor's Children, one of the twenty Primarchs created by the Emperor in the earliest days of the Imperium, just after the end of the Age of Strife. Fulgrim, like the other Primarchs, was sucked from Terra by the Gods of Chaos and placed on a faraway world in an attempt to prevent the coming of the Age of the Imperium. Constantly seeking to emulate the Emperor by perfecting himself, Fulgrim's obsession bred a hubris that drove him to eventually become consumed by the Chaos God Slaanesh. Tullea, Corrin, and Sullax were labourers of the resource-poor world of Chemos sent to investigate a meteorite impact. Sent without transport, the three had to take shelter from a wire-storm in an abandoned factory. When they reached the impact site, they didn't find a fallen satellite or spacecraft, they found an ever-shifting mass of light. Sullax was wary, but Corrin felt that it was harmless. Corrin watched the light take shape and it touched his mind, learning everything he knew, before it took the shape of a perfectly-formed baby boy. Sullax wanted to kill the child, seeing it as a burden on their resources, but the child had entranced Corrin and he refused. Tullea shot Sullax and neither of them felt any guilt over killing him to save the perfect baby. Noticing that a stream of pure water had formed where the baby had landed, Corrin decided to name the child after the water-bringer of Chemos's creation myth, Fulgrim.[5a]
Shrouded Hand	The Shrouded Hand are an Alpha Legion Warband made up of Chosen. At an unknown date, the Shrouded Hand infiltrated the way station world of Zharastia Jensen, a principal link in the supply chain of the Golgotha System. In their interactions amongst the lower strata of society to recruit more Operatives, the Shrouded Hand uncovered a Genestealer Cult. In doing so they triggered an uprising that saw the populace rise up to seize the planet. The sleeper cells placed by the Alpha Legion were awakened by the coded messages of the Shrouded Hand, and a bloody war erupted between the Alpha Legion operatives and Genestealer cultists. Content that Zharastia Jensen was now broken, the Shrouded Hand disappeared without trace. In M42, they were one of the warbands that joined Solomon Akurra's Ghost Legion coalition of Alpha Legion warbands.
Crowfeast of Xenorak	The Crowfeast of Xenorak are a Night Lords warband known to be active during the Nachmund Rift War.
Sons of Sorrow	The Sons of Sorrow are a Death Guard Warband. The Warband serves as part of the Death Guard's 7th Plague Company.
Endless Murder	The Endless Murder were a World Eaters warband.[1a] They had the ability to appear out of nowhere to strike their enemies, reducing them to bloody carrion and heaped skulls before vanishing like mist to parts unknown. They were later part of the Butcherhorde that was led by Khârn, and took part in the Black Legion's Diamor Campaign.[1a] However, like all of the Butcherhorde, they were abandoned on Amethal after the Black Legion had completed their objective, and are believed to have been destroyed by the Imperium's forces defending the world.[1b]
Pallid Hand	The Pallid Hand are a Death Guard Warband of the 2nd Plague Company. They are masters of the armoured assault and employ a greater number of Chaos Predators and Land Raiders than any other Death Guard Warband. The Pallid Hand are also carriers of the Ferric Blight disease.[2a] Their preferred strategy is to blast a brutal breach through enemy lines using concentrated fire from Predators and Land Raiders. Once the defenses rupture, transport vehicles surge forward, striking deep into enemy ranks like a venomous spike. Plague Marines then disembark and flood the battlefield, infecting and dismantling the enemy from within like a spreading contagion.
Witchcleavers	The Witchcleavers are a World Eaters warband. Led by the Skalathrax veteran Goran Zaal and renowned for their hatred of psykers, they operate out of the many Warp Storms and spatial anomalies in Segmentum Obscurus. They are known for their tendency to ambush Imperial Black Ships, pillage Astropathic Relay Stations, fought against Eldar Craftworld Iybraesil, raided Crone Worlds across the Eye of Terror, and have even taken the heads of Black Legion Sorcerers. Members of the warband can smell the taint of psykers and trace it to its point of origin with unerring accuracy. The champions of the warband believe the skulls of potent psykers and other psychic creatures to be a grand prize, and their armour and vehicles are adorned with such gory trophies. The opening of the Great Rift and subsequent increase in psykers across the galaxy has kept the Witchcleavers busier than ever before.
Slaughterkin	The Slaughterkin are a Khorne Warband.[1b] Originally the Third Company of the Shadow Hawks Chapter, their Captain, Mahaur, led them into rebellion against the Imperium in in 304.M39, after they faced censure for their actions in The Cruach Mhorn Massacres. He then lead the remains of his Company in a series of raids on Imperial fleets and outposts in the Cruach System, before they vanished into the Halo Stars.[1a] There their downfall would be complete, after the Company fell under the influence of Khorne and was reborn as the Slaughterkin.[1b] While being led by Mahaur the Harvester, the Slaughterkin laid waste to the three worlds of the Hreidmal Cluster; as well as an Administratum tithe-fleet that had arrived afterwards, seeking to claim a tally of lives and produce from the Cluster.[1b] The Harvester also led them to strike out against the Imperium on the Agri World Kerrack, when he created the Charnel Cult from the world's population and soon instigated a wide scale rebellion. The Warband later took part in the fighting when the Imperium's forces arrived to put down the rebellion, but disaster struck as the Star Phantoms Chapter arrived in Kerrack's orbit. The Space Marines soon launched a devastating assault on the Slaughterkin's stronghold on Kerrack; which resulted in the death of Mahaur and the now leaderless Warband being driven off of the Agri World. Without their continued presence, the Imperium was able to end the rebellion and reclaim Kerrack.[1c]
Savage Spectres	The Savage Spectres are a Black Legion Warband. Though only seven in number, the Savage Spectres serve as effective shock troops for the Black Legion and are often recruited for missions where stealth and violence are both required. One such mission was during the Black Legion's attack on the Imperium world Carvinia, where the Warband infiltrated an Astra Militarum command bunker and slaughtered everyone within it without firing a shot. When the Black Legion's main assault began, the Guardsmen outside the bunker found themselves completely leaderless.

The forces of Chaos are moving against the Imperium once more, and only YOU can stop them! The first in a new series of Warhammer 40,000 adventure game books, Hive of the Dead casts you in the role of an Imperial Guardsman, fighting for survival upon the plague-ridden world of Subiaco Diablo at the beginning of the Thirteenth Black Crusade. Face all the horrors of Abaddon’s legions, including Death Guard Chaos Space Marines, the walking dead, and foul warp-spawned daemons. Will you make the ultimate sacrifice for the good of mankind, or will your name be forgotten with the rest?
Scalpers of Skalathrax	The Scalpers of Skalathrax are a World Eaters Warband.
Maulers	The Maulers are a large Khorne Warband that took part in the Chaos God's Blood Crusade during the Thirteenth Black Crusade.
The Thricewarped	The Thricewarped are a Chaos Space Marine Warband.
Sect of the Red Echo	The Sect of the Red Echo are a warband of the Thousand Sons. Though their leaders were once known for their forbearance, the Sect of the Red Echo has carved a gruesome warpath since falling to Tzeentch, with haunting screams following wherever they go. Some amongst the Cult of Time interpret these as the dying cries of their victims, others as the mad harmonies of the warp itself.
Skull Knights	The Skull Knights are a Chaos Space Marine Warband. Some time after the Great Rift's creation, the Skull Knights invaded the Imperium world Jakhtor. However, just as the Warband had nearly conquered the world, a large Ork Blood Axe horde invaded Jakhtor and destroyed the Skull Knights.
Hammers Relentless	The Hammers Relentless are an Iron Warriors Warband.
Screaming Mind	The Screaming Mind are a Word Bearers Warband. They are known to have taken part in the Nachmund Rift War
Sons of Slaughter (Warband)	The Sons of Slaughter were a warband of Khorne Chaos Space Marines.[1a] The Sons of Slaughter were a Khorne warband who were part of the Butcherhorde that was led by Khârn, and took part in the Black Legion's Diamor Campaign.[1a] However, like all of the Butcherhorde, they were abandoned on Amethal after the Black Legion had completed their objective, and were destroyed by the Imperium's forces defending the world.[1b] Despite their seemingly destruction they were also a part of the Chaos forces during the Battle of Faith's Anchorage.
Yorgol's Vomitmaws	Yorgol's Vomitmaws are a Nurgle Warband. The warband launched an attack on the Imperium world of Grenetus Major by infecting an erupting volcano with a pox-blessing from Nurgle's own cauldrons. The pox corrupted the volcano and caused it to gush out great rivers of infectious pus.
Soulfangs	The Soulfangs are a small Alpha Legion Warband. They are corrupted by the Warp, which has caused the Warband's power armor to become twisted and caused their heavy weaponry to almost seem to be a part of them. The Soulfangs are among the Alpha Legion's Warbands, that are active in the Ultima Segmentum.
Sons of Helios	The Sons of Helios were a Space Marine Chapter[1a] which unknowingly caused themselves to fall to Chaos.[1b] The credo of this Chapter is in preserving purity of mind and avoiding the psychic arts. They are a stoic and martial Chapter, and this fact saved most of them during the appearance of the Great Rift in late M41, when their home planet — Tocharion — was possessed and devoured by the Rift.[1b] The last of their strongholds — Saarik Station, renamed The Horns of the Abyss — once orbited Tocharion and now hangs near the Great Rift itself. It was conquered by Chaos forces. However, a small garrison of the Sons of Helios remained on the station, prompting Dragomir to ask Lucius Antros, a Librarian of the Blood Angels, to help reclaim The Horns of the Abyss and save his brothers.[1b]
Ten Thousand Eyes	The Ten Thousand Eyes are a large Chaos Warhost, that was led by the Fallen Angel Sorcerer Lord, Seraphax.[1a] Due to Seraphax's leadership and the Warhost's might, the Ten Thousand Eyes control several worlds within the Imperium Nihilus.[1c] Among their forces is the fallen Space Marine Chapter the Dolorous Guard (formerly the Ashen Blades), which serve as Seraphax's bodyguards[1a], and the Broken Horn beastmen warband.[1f] When it was discovered that Lion El'Jonson had returned on Camarth to defeat a host of Ten Thousand Eyes Space Marines, Seraphax sought to capture the Primarch and use him for his own plans to turn the Emperor into a warp deity. In the subsequent battle on Sable, Seraphax captured the Lion but was foiled by The Risen as well as a betrayal by his lieutenant Baelor.[1e]
Shaven Mane	The Shaven Mane are a Chaos Space Marine Warband, that almost fetishes its warriors' perceived humiliation by the Imperium. They believe themselves to have once been betrayed, abandoned or subservient to the weak and have harden their hearts as a result. The zealously stoic Warband now push on through horrendous wounds they receive, as the Shaven Mane refuse to allow any the satisfaction of laying them low.
Blood Brotherhood	The Blood Brotherhood are a World Eaters Warband. In battle the Warband will seek out the strongest foes, in order to anoint their weapons in their blood.
Tatterskulls	The Tatterskulls are a Chaos Space Marine Warband. They were among the many Warbands that were defeated in battle by the Crimson Sabres, when the cursed Chapter sought to martyr itself within the Eye of Terror.
Warband of Sektoth	The Warband of Sektoth is a Thousand Sons warband active in the Screaming Vortex and Calixis Sector. The Warband is under the command of Sektoth, who leads hundreds of Rubric Marines, Sorcerers, and other renegades to plunder any planet that has the resources to fuel his research into the Rubric of Ahriman. The Warband prefers to deploy Psykers onto planets before any attack in order to cause disruption and mayhem, frequently using tactics that turn the enemy on themselves. The Warband's flagship is a frigate called The Unyielding.
Talons of Anathrax	The Talons of Anathrax are a Chaos Space Marine warband. Originally known as the Argent Hammers, they were among the thirty Chapters whose homeworld lay in the path of the Warp Storm Dionys that appeared in M37. In Dionys's wake the levels of mutation and cultist activity rose dramatically and the Chapters caught in it had their gene-seed corrupted. When the powerful and influential Saint Basillius heard of this, he declared all those Chapters whose homeworlds had become corrupted to be rendered into his judgement. Such was his influence that the High Lords of Terra agreed to the decision, and 30 chapters were found to be corrupted. Basillius ordered that the 30 Chapters take part in the Abyssal Crusade into the Eye of Terror, and one by one the Chapters solemnly undertook their quest of certain doom in 321.M37. By unknown means parts of the Argent Hammers were corrupted into the Talons of Anathrax Chaos Space Marine warband.
Shards of Enmity	The Shards of Enmity are a Chaos Space Marine Warband that is active in the Screaming Vortex. The Warband are the remnants of a Space Marine Chapter that was declared heretical after they subjugated the planet Cataegis IV. While they were still on Cataegis IV, the Imperium sent a taskforce that attacked the unsuspecting Chapter and nearly destroyed them. A scattered few renegades managed to escape the Imperium's wrath within the Screaming Vortex and now plot their vengeance on the accursed Imperium that betrayed them.
Tenebrae	The Tenebrae are a warband of Chaos Space Marines.[1c] They are believed to have fallen to Chaos since the Horus Heresy,[1d] although almost nothing is known about their origins aside of them being active since before M33. Though relatively little-known in the Imperium, the Inquisition considers the Tenebrae one of the most-long-lived and dangerous Chaos warbands in existence. The warband is infamous for always appearing in areas already affected by crisis to sow further discord and madness. The Tenebrae are a shadowy group, and avoided even by other followers of Chaos, as their mere presence seems to cause insanity and consume light.[1c] Their exact loyalties are unclear, but the Tenebrae are very well-equipped with the full arsenal available to loyalist Space Marines, and many ancient war machines such as Fellblades as well as dark artefacts.[1c]
Blacksouls	The Blacksouls are a Chaos Space Marine warband active in the Choraplex. Its members are made up of a wide variety of Chaos Legions and Warbands.
Reflected Ones	The Reflected Ones are a Thousand Sons Warband. They view realspace as an imperfect mirroring of the Warp, and seek to scour the galaxy of its impurities by weaving world-spanning mutagenic spells. The ranks of their enemies devolve into Chaos Spawn and braying Tzaangor herds before the Thousand Sons even set foot on the battlefield. They are also referred to as the Reflective Ones.
Lorehost of Apoketh	The Lorehost of Apoketh are Trallbands of the Thousand Sons.
Rotigus	Rotigus, the Generous One, is a powerful Great Unclean One of Nurgle, who is also known as Rotigus Rainfather and the Rainfather.[7a] He was second in Nurgle's favor until after the Plague Wars, when Rotigus was elevated over Ku'gath.[7d] Rotigus causes repugnant plant life to spread about him in waves wherever he goes. Such is the strength of this power, that Rotigus feels no need to carry weapons and instead bears a Gnarlrod, covered in trophies and icons, which constantly rots and regenerates from a seed to bring forth ever-more foul diseases. He also manifests Nurgle's Deluge – a rotten, diseased storm that eternally hovers over his mountainous form and unleashes a vile downpour that spreads the blessing of Nurgle to every far corner of the battlefield. Rotigus is also worshiped by mortals in the far corners of the universe as a generous, life-giving deity of prosperity and fecundity. However the gifts he gives are foul in nature, and any who pray for his patronage soon see the error of their ways. During the Horus Heresy, Rotigus was among the Greater Daemons summoned into Realspace by the Thousand Sons, during the Battle for Terra[6a]. After the Lion's Gate Spaceport fell to the Traitors, the Daemons were unleashed to destroy the Imperial Palace's Colossi Gate[6b]. While they succeeded in tearing down the Gate's outer defenses, the Daemons were destroyed by the White Scars' Stormseers and the Adeptus Custodes, before they could complete their task.[6c]
Skarbrand	Skarbrand the Exiled One is a Bloodthirster of Khorne. Skarbrand was one of the greatest champions of the Blood God. He has slain untold millions, left entire worlds ravaged in his wake, and even ravaged the realms of the other Chaos Gods. It is he who destroyed the First Palace of Slaanesh and killed Nurgle's great poxviathan. In the great battle with the mightiest of Bloodthirsters, he received his axes - Slaughter and Carnage - which are imbued with the spirits of defeated enemies.[5b] However, it is also this unswayable dedication to destruction that proved to be Skarbrand's undoing. Tzeentch, having taken note of the prowess of Khorne's favoured slaughterer, fuelled Skarbrand's rage even more with his whispers. With constant taunting, Tzeentch goaded Skarbrand into ever greater acts of destruction, until his rage grew so great that Skarbrand took up his axe against Khorne himself when his attention was elsewhere. Although powerful enough to fell an army, Skarbrand had only succeeded in opening up a chink in the armour of the Blood God. Enraged, Khorne snatched up Skarbrand in his clawed grip, and choked him until all vestiges of personality and thought had left the Bloodthirster, leaving only his rage behind. Khorne dragged Skarbrand to the pinnacle of the Brass Citadel and held him aloft for all to see. Then Khorne hurled Skarbrand across the Warp, where he flew for eight days and nights, leaving a blazing trail of destruction across the realms of the Gods. Skarbrand's landing carved out a massive canyon, and tore his wings to shreds.

White Dwarf is Games Workshop's premium Warhammer magazine, packed with amazing content each month such as new rules and background, short stories, regular columns, special guests and more. Here’s what you can look forward to in November’s issue:
Verdigrised Guard	Verdigrised Guard were a Chaos Space Marine chapter. They were destroyed during the failed attempt to claim one of the Arks of Omen.
Greater Daemon	Greater Daemons are a classification of Daemons.[1a] Greater Daemons are the most powerful of the Chaos Gods' servants and are reflections of their patron Gods. They act as wardens of their patron's realm and have authority over the Lesser Daemons of their respective God. It is often they who lead Daemonic Incursion.[1a] Chaos Undivided also has Greater Daemons as well, though their forms are not similar in appearance like those that are reflections of the Chaos Gods. Such is their might that Greater Daemons cannot simply be summoned like Lesser Daemons. Instead they need to possess a living body in order to manifest into Realspace.[1a] Thus far only a single type of Greater Daemon is known for each Chaos God. These include:[1a]
Shalaxi Helbane	Shalaxi Helbane, known as the Monarch of the Hunt[3a], is a Slaaneshi Keeper of Secrets and is the undisputed martial champion amongst the Chaos God's Daemons. Shalaxi was created by Slaanesh to fight and defeat rival Greater Daemons, especially Khorne's Bloodthirsters, and Shalaxi has bested some of the most formidable adversaries in the galaxy. If rumours are to be believed, this includes the dreaded Bloodthirster Skarbrand himself. Myths also tell of Helbane's quest into the Garden of Nurgle to bring the Prince of Corpseblooms to the Palace of Slaanesh. Besides immaterial foes, past targets of Shalaxi have included regents, warlords, Tyranid monstrosities, Knights, and C'tan Shards. Shalaxi tracks and pursues the greatest prey no matter where in existence they attempt to hide. Able to track their quarry across any environment, space, or dimension, sooner of later they will invariably run their foe to ground and engage them in battle. The more powerful the prey, the greater the torment Shalaxi will inflict upon them.
Fire Riders	The Fire Riders are a World Eaters Warband. It is led by the Chaos Lord Invocatus, who leads them into battle from the embarkation decks of their flagship Redblade Rider. Due to the blessing of Khorne, he can ride the Juggernaut Khal'guruth across the sly as if the Chaos Lord is on the ground. When Invocatus does so, a bridge of fire is created behind the daemon steed, which the Fire Riders and their vehicles can then travel upon. These are also accompanied by the Warband's aerial forces. The mobility the bridges give the Fire Riders is important to their raiding tactics, as it allows them to launch raids on unsuspecting worlds with supernatural speed. Upon doing so, the Warband strikes with devastating hit-and-run attacks that devastate their foes. Though other World Eaters look down upon them for such tactics, none can deny the increasing victories that Invocatus and the Fire Riders have achieved. Key to this is his Bloodstorm Helm, which lets him see even the most elaborate or well-crafted ambushes before they are sprung. This, combined with Invocatus's innate gifts, allowed the Fire Riders to achieve their most infamous victory, when they destroyed the Deathwatch Watch Fortress Ebon Vale with the Brazen Beasts' aid. However, despite all this, the Chaos Lord has little regard for his warband. This could not be made clearer than the Fire Riders' victory over a Hrud migration fleet in the Rengar System. While the xenos were torn apart by the warband, those Fire Riders that survived soon succumbed to the Hruds' time-distorting abilities. This left Invocatus as the only survivor, but he was able to rebuild his warband and continue his string of victories.
Scions of Medrengard	The Scions of Medrengard are an Iron Warriors warband which took part in the Nachmund Rift War.
Traitor Guard	Traitor Guard (or guardsmen), officially known as the Hereticus Militarium, is a term given to the vast majority of disloyal mortals who have left the Imperial Guard and Planetary Defence Forces in order to fight for Chaos. They are not a single coherent force, but rather a faction of the infinite collection of warbands and hosts under the leadership of Chaos Champions and part of the The Lost and the Damned. In order to fulfil their own agendas, Champions of Chaos draw lesser Chaos followers to them to form their own personal armies, which can vary tremendously in size and strength. The Traitor Guard are among the better armed and minded troops that Chaos Champions and/or Arch-Heretics have at their disposal. Like other Imperial military deserters who have turned from their Emperor and fled from Imperial justice. Occasionally entire companies, or even regiments of the Imperial Guard turn to Chaos, and take with them their vehicles and armoury.[1b] These traitors, unlike other mutants and other vile Beastmen, have not completely lost their military skills or sanity, forming a reasonably reliable core force amongst the slavering hordes of the Lost and Damned armies. Often these mortal guardsmen will fight alongside mutants or Daemons of the warp by summoning them by way of blasphemous rituals. Their allies are complemented further with monstrosities of all kinds, such as Chaos Spawns, hordes of mutants and Beastmen, and packs of Chaos Hounds.[Needs Citation]
Dark Mechanicum	The Dark Mechanicum, or Dark Mechanicus, referred to by themselves as the New Mechanicum[6b] or True Mechanicum,[20a] is a Chaos-affiliated counterpart to the Adeptus Mechanicus. Its origins trace back to those who pledged loyalty to Warmaster Horus at the end of the Great Crusade. The Dark Mechanicum serves as a dark "mirror" to their counterparts within the Imperium. The tech-adepts of the Dark Mechanicum readily adopting black robes and wore a perversion of the Machina Opus. The symbol of the Machine God were the 8 arrows making the star of Chaos with and the skull wore an daemonic grimace. These adepts quickly be bestowed with mutation and other Gifts of Chaos. Horus gained the loyalty of a sect within the Mechanicum after promising them STC technology gained from the worlds of the Auretian Technocracy and the opening of the vaults of forbidden technology on Mars. In addition, Horus's emissaries and spies told the Tech-Priests that the Emperor planned to steal the secrets and technology of the Martian Mechanicum and even eventually enslave the Tech-Priests. Lastly, Horus used the ideological schism within the Mechanicum, between those who believed the Emperor was the earthly representation of the Omnissiah and those who still thought such a figure was entombed on Mars, suggesting it was the Emperor himself who had presented himself as their god in a scheme to make him their servants.[4b]
Excorias Elite	The Excorias Elite are a Scourged Warband.
Daemonic Herald	Daemonic Heralds are exalted Lesser Daemons who have gained the favor of their Gods, often leading Daemonic armies into battle. Each of the four main Chaos Gods has their own variant: Bloodletter • Bloodcrusher • Skull Cannon • Bloodthirster • Herald of Khorne • Bloodmaster • Blood Throne • Sacred Executioner • Skullmaster • Daemon Engines of Khorne • Blood Reaper • Blood Slaughterer • Brass Scorpion • Cauldron of Blood • Death Dealer • Doom Blaster • Kytan • Lord of Battles • Lord of Skulls • Tower of Skulls • Flesh Hound • Juggernaut • Skull Altar • Skarbrand • An'ggrath • Angron • Doombreed • Skulltaker • Karanak
Khorne	Khorne, the Blood God, is the Chaos God of anger, violence, and hate. Khorne was the first to awake of the four Gods of Chaos, fully coming into existence during Terra's Middle Ages - an era of wars blooming in the wake of his birth. Every act of violence gives Khorne power, whether committed by his followers or by their enemies. His titles include the Lord of Rage, the Taker of Skulls, the Lord of Battle,[16b][17c][20f] the Lord Gore, the Master of the Brazen Throne and the Great Butcher. The name "Khorne" derives from his Dark Tongue name, "Kharneth", meaning "Lord of Rage" or "Lord of Blood".[17a][30a] Although Khorne despises the use of magic and accordingly hates Tzeentch, Slaanesh is the one he loathes most of all. Khorne and Slaanesh personify two entirely opposing aspects of Chaos, and Khorne considers Slaanesh's self-indulgent sensualities insulting.[16a] Khorne is said to have inherited the instinctive values of martial honour, pride and bravery, some of Khorne's followers using these to justify their killings. But Khorne's most fanatical worshippers know that Khorne cares not from where the blood flows, only that it does - all else is meaningless artifice.[16a][17b][19a][20f] His associated number is eight, reflected in the organisation of his armies, and in smaller matters such as the number of syllables in a daemonic follower's name.[18a][20a]
Weeping Legion	The Weeping Legion are a Death Guard Warband belonging to the 5th Plague Company The Warband's appearance shows how they earned their name, as the Weeping Legion enter a battle covered in the foul ichor of their own continuously dripping wounds. However, this benefits the Warband, as with each layer of rancid filth that encrusts their armour, the Weeping Legion become even more resistant to damage. Wherever these warriors set foot, the battleground swiftly transforms into a blood-soaked quagmire of vile corruption, so abhorrent that the enemy can no longer withstand its horrors. The Weeping Legion is known to favor the use of Daemon Engines which they employ alongside large numbers of alongside their Plague Marines and Terminators. Such is their desire to acquire more Daemon Engines that they have struck bargains with the Dark Mechanicum of the Tri-Forge Cluster. In exchange they regularly raid loyalist Mechanicum holdings in order to seize adepts and technology to trade with the Dark Magi for more Daemon Engines.
Chaos Knight	Chaos Knights, also known as Daemon Knights, Renegade Knights or Questor Traitoris, are Knights and their Households that have been corrupted by the powers of Chaos. Since the Horus Heresy, thousands of individual Knights and even entire Knight Houses have been corrupted by Chaos and betrayed the Imperium. The first Renegade Knights appeared during the Horus Heresy, when many of the Knightly households sided with Warmaster Horus.[3a] However since the Heresy, many more Knights have betrayed the Imperium. Some were corrupted after their worlds were swallowed by Warp Storms while others were slowly driven mad by the endless carnage they witnessed and inflicted on countless campaigns.[3b] Each Chaos Knight is twisted reflections of the Imperial Knights. The Knight suits were first created using Standard Template Constructs during the Dark Age of Technology, and many have survived through the innumerable wars that have characterized the long millennia since. Over years or even centuries, Chaos energies seep into the war engine, torturing its Machine Spirit and mutating its mechanical form. Where once the suit and its pilot were a gleaming beacon, the Chaos Knight and its Fallen Noble comprise a symbiotic beast of wrath and hate. A Noble is enabled to pilot their war machine by being wired into an arcane contraption that is implanted into their Knight’s cockpit the Throne Mechanicum in the larger Knights, or a Helm Mechanicum in the smaller classes. Within each Throne Mechanicum are the spectral echoes of its previous pilots. Thus only the strongest of the Fallen Pilots are able to commune with a Throne Mechanicum and not go mad in the process. Even those who survived become tortured beings, their suffering reflected in their Throne Mechanicum for centuries to come. Nobles who are wired into a Helm Mechanicum are similarly twisted by Chaos energies that have been absorbed by their war engine. The Helms also yoke these pilots mind and soul to the will of their Knightly overlords.[3a] Other less fortunate pilots have fused entirely to their Throne Mechanicum while others have simply died and their suits are now controlled wholly by Daemons.[3b]
Blue Scribes	The Blue Scribes, individually known as P'tarix and Xirat'p, are two Blue Horrors of Tzeentch. There was a time when Tzeentch reigned supreme over all of the Chaos Gods, and held more power than any of them individually. The other Gods became envious, and joined forces to overthrow Tzeentch, thus beginning a conflict that would leave much of the universe devastated. During the final battle, Tzeentch feared that the combined army of the other Gods would defeat him and take his crystal staff, the symbol of his power, and opted for an alternate and more cautious approach. Tzeentch yielded, and broke his own staff as a token of surrender. In a sorcerous explosion, the staff shattered into countless pieces. Each of these fragments took the form of a different spell, and was flung to every corner of space and time, irredeemably lost. This event coincides with the birth of magic, and helped ensure that nobody would ever wield as much power as Tzeentch once did. After his defeat, Tzeentch created the Blue Scribes, the Blue Horrors P'tarix and Xirat'p, and tasked them with a mission to travel through the many dimensions of reality to find and record every known spell, which would eventually regain every shard of the staff. To aid them, Tzeentch gave the Scribes a Disc of Tzeentch to travel on, and to carry the huge amounts of parchment and ink that they needed. The reason why Tzeentch chose such lowly daemons for this important task was because their limited intelligence and constant bickering posed little threat to him, and thus they could be trusted with handling such a terrible power. If P'tarix and Xirat'p were to ever complete their mission, Tzeentch would regain his supremacy over all of creation. The Blue Scribes carry the Scrolls of Sorcery, which contain every magical spell ever conceived.
Beastmen	Beastmen (Homo sapiens variatus) are bestial abhumans combining the forms of animal and human. They are considered to be fairly genetically stable compared to those afflicted by more random, unpredictable mutations. Beastmen are known to have first appeared during the Age of Strife. At some point in their ancestry they merged with animal strains. In general they have cloven hooves, digitigrade legs (legs that appear to be backwards jointed, like the hind legs of a goat) and faces that resemble animals. Their arms and hands are usually similar to a standard humans, allowing them to use human weapons and tools. They were formerly freely recruited in number for the Imperial Guard, where they were valued mainly for their bloodlust; they fought for the Emperor in order to atone for their sin of being born mutants. They were led by Beastmen called Packmasters and included in the Militarum Auxilla. However, Beastmen are seen less in Imperial service than they were before. They are now subject to severe Imperial persecution and have been placed on the Register of Proscribed Citizens (Class A-G worlds) by the Adeptus Arbites. As such, they are effectively precluded from settlement on, or transportation to or from, more than three hundred thousand worlds of the Imperium and are forbidden from being conscripted as an Imperial Tithe obligation. These restrictions are a sure sign that Beastmen will soon lose their abhuman status completely and be reclassified as Xenos Horrificus and marked for eradication.
Seers of Alltome	The Seers of Alltome are a Scourged Warband.
Eye of Terror	The Eye of Terror (Ocularis Terribus, Anathema Nonplus Ultra (Ordo Malleus), Ocularis Malifica) is a massive Warp rift, where the Warp co-exists with real space, the largest and most well-known in the Galaxy. It is located at the edge of the Galaxy, to the north and west of Terra, in the Segmentum Obscurus. The Eye of Terror is an area of the Galaxy where the Warp and realspace overlap. A ship can enter the Warp without a Warp drive simply by crossing its border. The area used to be the domain of the old Eldar empire. When Slaanesh was born, the energy of their birth permanently breached the veil between realspace and the Warp; all the planets and stars that existed in that area are now within the Warp. These worlds have become daemon worlds. At the very centre of the Eye lies the "byssos", a hole in the fabric of reality through which raw Chaos energy pours out. The Eye of Terror is not a natural phenomenon, as it was created by the Old Ones during the War in Heaven, as they fought the Necrons. The Necrons would later seal the Eye of Terror closed but it was later reopened by the psychic shock wave that accompanied the birth of the fourth Chaos God, Slaanesh, during the Fall of the Eldar.
Rypax	The Rypax are a twisted Slaanesh-worshipping Chaos Raptor Cult. Members of the Rypax are drawn across many different Legions, Chapters, and Warbands. Its ranks consist of Emperor's Children, Night Lords, Word Bearers, Iron Warriors, Flawless Host, Violators, Angels of Ecstasy, White Scars, and Brazen Claws. The only unifying factor is their dedication to Slaanesh. In M41, the warband came into conflict with both the World Eaters and Lucius the Eternal's Cohors Nasicae.
Sensorians	The Sensorians are a newly created Emperor's Children Warband. While working with the Dark Mechanicum, in an attempt to pioneer Daemon Engines equipped with suites of sonic weaponry, the Warband learned of Forge World Agripinaa. The Imperial Forge World's inhabitants were the ancestral enemies of the Dark Mechanicum and, after hearing of the sombre Skitarii guarding Agripinaa, the Sensorians were appalled by the notion that the Skitarii voluntarily exchanged their flesh for cybernetic replacements. In response to this, the Warband launched a raid on Agripinaa and captured several maniples of their Skitarii by using Scrapcode, before the Sensorians escaped back into the Eye of Terror. Once there, the Sensorians began experimenting on the captured Skitarii, by cutting out their cybernetic parts and replacing them with fleshy equivalents taken from Mutants, from corpses, even from fallen Chaos Spawn, until barely an ounce of metal was left. The Fleshlings of Sensoria, as these corrupted Skitarii are now called, were driven mad by the process, but proved to be a potent asset in the Long War against the Imperium.
Chaos Space Fleet	The fleets of Chaos are primarily made of Human ships that have turned traitor over the millennia. As such, a Chaos fleet can appear like a damned parody of the Imperial Navy's history, full of ships that have long since left service and are now rarely seen outside of the service of the Dark Gods. Chaos fleets often operate older vessels from a more enlightened time, resulting in their ships being of superior designs to their contemporary Imperial counterparts which emphasize long-range Lance and Macrocannon firepower. There are exceptions to this, of course. From the lowly Idolator Raider to the fearsome Planet Killer, Chaos has been known to make ships of its own, much to the detriment of Emperor's forces. Many Chaos vessels have had extended exposure to Warp Rifts, most notably the Eye of Terror. As a result, they are often heavily corrupted, twisted, and sometimes even quasi-sentient due to the presence of warp entities, a situation most prevalent with the Daemonship phenomena. The crews/slaves of Chaos vessels are often completely mad and heavily mutated.[11b] Besides former Imperial vessels, twisted Space Hulks are also a common sight in the fleets of Chaos. Many Chaos space fleets typically use the same methods of FTL seen with the Imperium, such as the Warp Drives. Just as with their Imperial counterparts, they also frequently utilize captured/enslaved or corrupted Navigators in order to circumnavigate the Warp.[11a] Other warbands however will instead use Sorcerers or even Daemons for navigation.[11b] More religiously fanatical Chaos fleets such as those of the Word Bearers will even forego the use of Gellar Fields, seeing their deactivation as a method of direct communion with the Ruinous Powers.
Corpsemakers (Death Guard)	The Corpsemakers are a Death Guard Warband. The warriors of the Corpsemakers see the destruction of the Imperium's grandest strongholds as their profane duty and will burrow into the bedrock of enemy bastions to undermine and corrupt the foundations. Once the Corpsemakers are finished the entire structure soon collapses before them.
Steel Cobras	The Steel Cobras are a Chaos Space Marine chapter created during the Twenty Third Founding.
Lesser Daemon	Lesser Daemons are a classification of Chaos Daemon. Lesser Daemons are the foot soldiers of Chaos, building the core of the Daemonic Legions. They are usually anthropomorphic in appearance and possess a calculating, malevolent intellect. Among the Daemons of Chaos they are ones most likely to answer the call of mortal heretics. Lesser Daemons are little more than slaves to the will of their patron Chaos God and take orders on the battlefield most often from Daemonic Heralds and Greater Daemons but also sometimes a Daemon Prince.
Honsou	Honsou is the Warsmith of an Iron Warriors Grand Company. He is notable for leading an army 17,000 strong, comprised of Traitor Marines, Xenos and Renegades, in the Invasion of Ultramar in 999.M41.[Needs Citation] Honsou's gene-seed originated from "Honourable" Soulaka, an Iron Warriors Apothecary who was murdered during the Horus Heresy by Fabius Bile, who was then responsible for melding Soulaka's gene-seed with that of an Imperial Fist, likely Captain Felix Cassander. After an accident in Bile's laboratory, the container holding Soulaka's gene-seed was partially defaced, leaving only the words "Hon Sou". Created a Chaos Space Marine sometime in M41, Honsou was looked down upon by the other Iron Warriors, due to the taint of his gene-seed with that of the hated Imperial Fists. He was often referred to as "Half-Breed".[1x][Needs Citation] Unlike many of this fellow Chaos Marines, who were veterans of the Long War, Honsou was a younger Marine, but despite his youth and his "tainted" heritage, he rose through the ranks of his Grand Company through bravery, tactical skill, and audacity.[1x][Needs Citation]
Thralls of Magnus	The Thralls of Magnus are a Thousand Sons Warband - the largest and most powerful sect of the Cult of Scheming, and have been since shortly after the Thousand Sons Legion's fall during the Horus Heresy. Many rival sects have sought to dethrone them, only to succumb to impossibly intricate traps and complots. The same inescapable fate has befallen countless Imperial and Xenos worlds.

Rebuilt (Warband)	The Rebuilt are an Iron Warriors Warband. More fully mechanical than other Iron Warriors, the Rebuilt not only have extensive bionics, but are possessed by clockwork Daemons as well. The Warband's vehicles have also been upgraded with parts that are completely composed of some kind of machine interface. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Holy Sons of Lorgar	The Holy Sons of Lorgar are a Word Bearers Warband.
Prodigal Sons	The Prodigal Sons are a Chaos Space Marine warband led by Ahriman of the Thousand Sons.[1a] The Prodigal Sons' origins trace back to the warband called The Brotherhood of Dust, led by Amon. This warband was created from many sorcerers and Rubric Marines of the Thousand Sons, along with Chaos Space Marines from numerous other factions.[2a] The warband eventually came under Ahriman control after he killed Amon in a duel.[2b] The colour scheme used on the armour of The Brotherhood of Dust was the same as that of the Pre-Heresy Thousand Sons: red with silver trim. Ahriman changed the colour scheme to blue with gold trim.[2c] Despite this, some members of the warband did not adopt the new colour scheme, such as Augustonar, who wore white armour, and Ignis, who wore orange.[3b]
Bronze Gorgons	The Crystal Wyverns are a Chaos Space Marine warband. Originally known as the Bronze Gorgons, they were among the thirty Chapters whose homeworld lay in the path of the Warp Storm Dionys that appeared in M37. In Dionys wake did the levels of mutation and cultist activity rose dramatically and the Chapters caught in it had their gene-seed corrupted. When the powerful and influential Saint Basillius heard of this, he declared all those Chapters whose homeworlds had become corrupted to be rendered into his judgement. Such was his influence that the High Lords of Terra agreed to the decision, and 30 chapters were found to be corrupted. Basillius ordered that the 30 Chapters take part in the Abyssal Crusade into the Eye of Terror, and one by one the Chapters solemnly undertook their quest of certain doom in 321.M37. When the Bronze Gorgons returned into Imperial Space they had been corrupted into the Crystal Wyverns.
Keepers of As'trakh	The Keepers of As'trakh are a Thousand Sons warband under the control of the Cult of Manipulation Sorcerer Lord Thenazar Agas. The thrallband has survived against coalitions of other Thousand Sons on numerous occasions.
Kairos Fateweaver	Fateweaver, the Oracle of Tzeentch originally known as Kairos, is the personal Vizir of Tzeentch - a Lord of Change capable of seeing things hidden even from the gaze of its master. It is numbered among the Conclave Diabolus, the hundred and one daemons the Grey Knights consider most dangerous. Although Tzeentch could see all of the past and present, he was unable to grasp all of the uncountable threads of the future. The need to overcome this one weakness took Tzeentch to the mystic Well of Eternity at the very centre of reality, where space and time originate and end. However, even Tzeentch was afraid to enter the roiling currents of the well; so instead he sent his Lords of Change, but none of them ever returned. Finally, Tzeentch grabbed his vizir Kairos and cast him into the well. This time, Kairos survived, just. But when he resurfaced, Kairos was unnaturally aged, hunched and wizened. His mighty pinions were reduced to feeble vestigial remains, and he now had two heads. Henceforth, Kairos held both the knowledge of the future and the resulting insanity, and sits at Tzeentch's right side as his Oracle. He is constantly mumbling madly, and suddenly bursting into rambling tirades about events still to happen. Eighty-one Lords of Change are tasked with recording every word of the Oracle. A few mighty individuals, mortal and Daemon alike, are granted an audience with the Oracle for the completion of the most challenging of tasks for Tzeentch. The Oracle knows the answer to all questions; but only one head will always answer the truth, while the other simultaneously delivers a contradictory answer, which is false but equally believable. The resulting riddle invariably leaves the petitioner baffled. On the rare occasion that Tzeentch sends Kairos to the mortal battlefield, he is known as Fateweaver. He and his daemonic bodyguards are truly unstoppable, for he is able to use his great magical power and incredible prescience to influence the course of the battle. However, if any unexpected harm comes to him, Kairos often retreats back to the Warp, afraid that his treacherous master might have intentionally hid that future from him.
Seventh-day Morbidians	The Seventh-day Morbidians are a Death Guard Warband.
Dhorngar's Goredrinkers	Dhorngar's Goredrinkers are a World Eaters Warband.
Thralls of the Eightfold Cog	The Thralls of the Eightfold Cog are a Khorne Dark Mechanicum Cult, that has a symbiotic relationship with a World Eaters Warband known as the Axes of the Forge. It has been beneficial for both sides and the warband for their part protects the Eightfold Cog and provides the cult with technological spoils and slaves from the Axes' raids. The Eightfold in return provides the Warband with ammunition, equipment, repairs, modifications and sacrifices the slaves in their creation of Khorne Daemon Engines. These Engines are then given to the Axes of the Forge or kept by the Eightfold, who are always in need of more slaves to create additional Daemon Engines. This has resulted in the Warband launching countless slave raids in order to find worthy souls for the Cult to sacrifice to the Blood God. The Eightfold are also aided in the creation of the Daemon Engines by their enslaved Sorcerers, who are kept line with Collars of Khorne and other anti-psyker technologies the Cult has created to keep them prisoners. This technology has been given to the Axes as well and the Warband has since made extensive use of it.
Disciples of Rage	The Disciples of Rage are a Khornate Chaos Space Marine warband.[1a] Under the command of a Chaos Lord dubbed the First Disciple, the warband was able to take over the Flesh Tearers Fortress Monastery on Cretacia due to the worlds isolation from the wider Imperium after the formation of the Great Rift.[1a] The warband planned to use the arrival of Flesh Tearers reinforcements under Chaplain Dumah to power a new ritual that would open a Warp portal on Cretacia, turning it into a Daemon World for Khorne.[1b] However, they were foiled by the Flesh Tearers in the Battle of Cretacia and the First Disciple was killed.[1c]
Six-Cursed	The Six-Cursed are a Thousand Sons Warband.[1a] In M41, Six-Cursed attacked the planet of Etiamnun III - a barren, airless planet on the Eastern Fringe. They completely destroyed the peaceful and innocent hermits of the local mountain complex, and then went down to the lowest levels to find the ancient entrance to Webway.[1b]
Sons of Malice	The Sons of Malice Space Marine Chapter turned renegade some time prior to the 13th Black Crusade.[1b] As with many Chapters, it is unclear during which Founding the Sons of Malice were created or what their original Chapter name was before their corruption. It is suspected that they were one of the 20 Space Marine Chapters referred to as the Astartes Praeses, which, according to the Mythos Angelica Mortis, were Founded with the express purpose of guarding the regions surrounding the Eye of Terror. It is alarming that the Sons of Malice were not brought to the attention of the Inquisition sooner, especially due to their widely-reported custom of cannibalistically consuming their defeated foes. Events leading to the Chapter's excommunication began following the successful end of the Cilix 225 Campaign against Heretics who had threatened to depressurise three underwater hive cities on that world, and ultimately led the Chapter to declare itself to be both enemies of the Imperium of Man and the Forces of Chaos.[1b]
Maggot Lords	The Maggot Lords are a Death Guard Warband, that are led by the Lord of Virulence Sholgor. In battle, he is able to increase the efficacy of their coordinated fire.
Glittering Myriad	The Glittering Myriad are a warband of the Emperor's Children. Led by Aesclemos, the Silvered Regent, the warband is known for its gilded battle plates and opalescent war engines. They have launched swift armoured assaults across the eastern reaches of the Reductus Sector.
Rogue Psyker	Rogue Psykers are Human Psykers that now belong to the Forces of Chaos. Many have eluded either the Inquisition's Ordo Hereticus or the Adeptus Astra Telepathica's League of Blackships and have become tainted by the Gods of Chaos, a process which drives the psyker completely insane. Their powers are completely out of control, capable of causing mass destruction but also making the psyker himself prone to possession by Daemons. Rogue Psyker
Thousand Sons	The Thousand Sons were the XV Legion of the original twenty Space Marine Legions. Their Primarch is Magnus, oft called Magnus the Red. The Legion turned traitor during the Horus Heresy, after which it relocated to Sortiarius, the Planet of Sorcerers, in the Eye of Terror, and dedicated itself to the Chaos God of change, sorcery and magic, Tzeentch. For a time it appeared that Tzeentch protected the Thousand Sons from the corruption and fragmentation that most of the other Traitor Legions underwent, but eventually the Legion went through a crisis of mutation and de-evolution, seemingly at the wish of their patron-God. Aghast at this development, their chief sorcerer, Ahriman, cast a powerful spell designed to render the Thousand Sons immune to the warping effects of Chaos. While the spell succeeded in this goal, it had an unforseen consequence of transforming the mutated Thousand Sons into little more than mystically animated suits of armour barely capable of being termed as anything more sentient than automata. With the only surviving cognisant members being those incredibly strong in heretical psychic powers, the Thousand Sons are now a legion of ghosts led by the damned. The homeworld of the Thousand Sons was Prospero, a world populated by a small commune of outcast psykers. Once a world of great beauty, it was attacked by Imperial forces utilising planet-busting weapons during the Battle of Prospero,[2a] with the result that it became a blasted ruin, declared Purgatus by the Inquisition. Prospero would ultimately suffer the indignity of Imperial planetary bombardment a second time, ordered by the Inquisition in response to a large-scale gathering of Thousand Sons forces upon the planet as part of a sorcerous ritual. While the first bombardment (the one that took place during the first Battle of Prospero) ruined the planet's eco-system and tumbled all the works of both man and nature, it still left Prospero more-or-less recognisable. The second scoured the world with firestorms so intense that the surface of Prospero was turned into featureless black glass.[11a]
Dru'Kashyl	The Dru'Kashyl are an Iron Warriors warband[1a] led by Warsmith Bolaraphon from a network of fortified asteroids.[1b] The name Dru'Kashyl was derived from an Olympian term - depending on the specific dialect of Olympian, the word may translate as "garden", "mountain", "labyrinth" or a term for a anvil used for forming blades; Bolaraphon referred to it as the Iron Field.[1b] At the end of M41, the Dru'Kashyl was devastated by the formation of the Great Rift. Their asteroid belt was engulfed by the Warp Storm and their fleet was nearly entirely destroyed. Bolaraphon and the remains of the warband were able to escape aboard the Damnatio Memorae, the only surviving vessel.[1b]
Daemonic Beasts	Daemonic Beasts are a classification of Chaos Daemon. These more primal entities are lowest type and least intelligent of Daemons. They are often granted to other Daemons and occasionally, one of the Gods more powerful mortal followers. Daemonic Beasts are often used as Steeds for Lesser Daemons and their war engines. Some Chaos Champions also utilize Daemonic Steeds.
Heralds of the Inevitable End	The Heralds of the Inevitable End are a Black Legion Warband.
The Silent	The Silent are a renegade warband of Chaos Space Marines drawn from the Gene-Seed of the Raven Guard. Over a period of weeks, they captured the Imperial Navy Frigate Implacable Spear, assassinating key crew without being detected.
Skullhunt	The Skullhunt were a World Eaters warband. After hearing about the Tyranids and Orks that clash in an ever-escalating spiral of violence on Octarius, The World Eaters warband known as the Skullhunt of Vodha Bloodprice invaded the Octarius System. The World Eaters were not disappointed – within the space of a single year, over eight thousand skulls were offered to the Blood God, the smallest of which was the size of a boulder. Vodha ascended to daemonhood after slaying a Hierophant bio-titan with the greataxe of the fallen Ork Warboss.
Fractal Blades	The Fractal Blades are an elite Thousand Sons Warband. Long ago lost to the ages, scattered by the roiling tides of the warp, the Fractal Blades nonetheless serve the will of mighty Tzeentch. Led by the Sorcerer Basteq Shen, they continue to wage the Long War against the hated servants of the Imperium, annihilating anything foolish enough to stand in their way.
Rusted Claws (Warband)	The Rusted Claws are a Warband of the Death Guard's 2nd Plague Company. Along with the Tainted Lung Warband, the Rusted Claws took part in the successful invasion of the Imperium world Tsarvia II.
Traitor Titan Legion	The Traitor Titan Legions, or Titanicus Traitoris, are Titan Legions that have abandoned the Imperium and joined the Forces of Chaos. Nominally part of the Dark Mechanicum, they operate dreaded Titan warmachines that have been corrupted by the Gods of Chaos and the Powers of the Warp. Tracing their origins to the Horus Heresy, the Traitor Titan Legions maintain a fierce (and entirely mutual) hatred of the Adeptus Mechanicus. The origin of the Traitor Titan Legions can be traced back to the Horus Heresy when the Fabricator-General of the Adeptus Mechanicus, Kelbor-Hal, sided with the traitorous Warmaster Horus and took over half of the Titan Legions of the Collegia Titanica with him in rebellion against the Emperor. After Horus' defeat most of the Traitor Titan Legions followed the example of their Chaos Space Marine brethren and fled into the Eye of Terror. Since that time, they have looked for opportunities for revenge against the Imperium and especially the loyalist Adeptus Mechanicus. Many have taken part in the Black Crusades of Abaddon the Despoiler as well as campaigns waged by other powerful Chaos Lords. During their stay on the Daemon Worlds of the Eye of Terror, Chaos Titans have become mutated and warped. Many have grown tails, grown Daemonic faces and other features, and and will radiate with the powers of the Warp. Nearly all of them have been altered in some way.
Be'lakor	Be'lakor, the Dark Master, also known as the First Prince of Chaos and the One Who Heralds the Conquerors, is a Daemon Prince of Chaos Undivided; he is beholden to each of the Chaos Gods equally. Like a petulant first-born son, he is jealous of anyone that wins the favor of Chaos, and thus seeks to undermine them. Be'lakor was the first mortal elevated to Daemonhood by Chaos. However, much of his origins are hidden behind legend and rumour, tales torn from the tongues of captive Daemons or as forbidden lore recorded in ancient crypts. Legends tell of Be’lakor ruling over mortal empires since the dawn of time, the Daemon Prince conquering a world and subjugating its people, forcing them to worship him as a god. When the race would fall into decline, ruined by Be’lakor’s greed and malevolence, the Daemon would move on, finding a new burgeoning race to be his playthings. Several times, the Daemon Prince is said to have been the lord of sector spanning empires, a dark daemonic god ruling over a thousand worlds and billions of loyal followers. Even the Grey Knights know very little of his history, what little information remaining suggesting that he has been ruling over mortal empires since the dawn of time, only to abandon them when they would fall into decline. Even this is just supposition, however, as these exist as impossible lies and conflicting fabrications. Whilst it is unclear how Be'lakor managed to draw the gaze of the Chaos Gods, he became the first mortal to be blessed by all four Ruinous Powers and became the first Daemon Prince. This would soon prove to be a mistake, however, as the Chaos Gods do not share for long, and soon they began to squabble for control over this winged Daemon Prince. But Be'lakor could and would not be tamed. Soon, the Chaos Gods gave up on trying to control the uncontrollable Daemon Prince, opting instead to invest their will in other mortals in the known universe. Although Be'lakor remained the strongest of the Daemon Princes, his power was greatly diminished as the Ruinous Powers began to put forth their own energies into other Daemon Prince. Since then, Be'lakor has held a bitter jealousy towards anyone who wins the favour of the Dark Gods. As such, he is known to undermine the plans of the servants of Chaos, a master of shadows exerting his will in subverting the intentions of the Dark Gods. However, what he believes to be his free-will is just a part of the rivalry between the Chaos Gods themselves.
The Soul Drinkers Omnibus	The Soul Drinkers Omnibus is a Soul Drinkers Omnibus edition containing three novels written by Ben Counter. The Soul Drinkers have served the Imperium loyally for thousands of years, but when the opportunity arrives to retrieve an ancient relic of their Chapter, blind obsession throws them into conflict with those whom they are honour-bound to obey. Faced with an impossible choice between their duty to the Imperium and their duty to the Emperor, will this proud and noble Chapter compromise its beliefs, or forge a new destiny for themselves among the stars? Cover art for the 2022 edition.
Siege-masters Olympian	The Siege-masters Olympian are an Iron Warriors Warband.
Chaos Vehicles	The forces of Chaos use a variety of vehicles, ranging from those derived from the Imperium they turned against, to hellish hybrids of machinery and daemonic entities. At the time of the Horus Heresy, the Imperium was in a state of great change with regards to its military arms: ancient technology rediscovered from the Great Crusade was being assimilated by the Adeptus Mechanicus and new improvements to both weaponry and armour were being filtered into the ranks of the Adeptus Astartes. Because of this, the forces battling in the Heresy used a combination of familiar and reliable technology from the Crusade previously and strange, arcane weapons from forgotten constructs. As the Traitor Legions were fighting in the furthest reaches from Terra and Mars, the radical improvements were encountered by them late, if at all. When the defeated legions fled into the Eye of Terror, they took with them the armour, weapons and vehicles they possessed during the Crusade - the following millennia in the altered time of the Eye kept them from the technological advances of the Imperium. Without the new advances of the Imperial troops, the wargear and vehicles of Chaos have become characteristically archaic (and often physically corrupted), but nonetheless brutal and terrifyingly effective. Although the Chaos forces lack modern developments such as Land Speeders, the consorting with daemons by the traitors has led to several daemonically possessed vehicles in their ranks.
Fecund Ones	The Fecund Ones are a Death Guard Warband belonging to the 7th Plague Company. Mortarion himself assigned the Fecund Ones to their task, which is to travel in search of Imperial Agri-Worlds to corrupt. The warriors of the Fecund Ones are often responsible for infecting Imperial Agri Worlds with any of the innumerable poxes of Nurgle. Once a new planet has been singled out, the Fecund Ones relentlessly work to transform it from a vital Loyalist stronghold into a festering cradle of decay. Whether unleashing chemical filth and plague-borne spores into the skies, cultivating cults devoted to Nurgle, or leading virulent assaults on the world’s defenders — they press on until the planet boils with corruption that endures long after they’ve departed.
Darganti Revenants	The Darganti Revenants are an Alpha Legion Warband.
Silver Guards	The Silver Guards are a Chaos Space Marine warband. The Silver Guards fought for the Imperium of Man during the first part of the Obscuran Uprisings, in late M34. But after the fighting against the Free Council of Hannedra II, they became drunk with power. They crushed the rebellion in the name of the Emperor, but then proceeded to loot and slaughter indiscriminately. By the time the Lords of Terra responded, the Silver Guards and the Sons of Vengeance had split into dozens of warring bands and turned fourteen star systems into their savage battleground as they spilled each other's blood in a savage war for dominance.
The Faithless	The Faithless were an Alpha Legion warband led by Chaos Lord Arkos the Faithless. They were based on the battle barge Anarchy's Heart and operated in the sectors near the Eye of Terror.[1a][2a] They took part in the Siege of Vraks and were for many years the only Chaos Space Marine warband active on the planet.[1b] The Faithless were eliminated in the final battles of the siege by the Angels of Absolution. The loyalists destroyed the warband's ship and took the few survivors, which included Arkos the Faithless, with them.[2b] Chaos Dreadnought
Harvest Macabre	The Harvest Macabre were a World Eaters warband of the Chaos Space Marines.[1a] They boasted brass war helms and skull designs upon their power armour, which were carved from the bones of their victims. They were part of the Butcherhorde that was led by Khârn and took part in the Black Legion's Diamor Campaign.[1a] However, like all of the Butcherhorde, they were abandoned on Amethal after the Black Legion had completed their objective and were destroyed by the Imperium's forces defending the world.[1b]
Gellerpox Infected	The Gellerpox Infected are warbands of Chaos corrupted Humans. Once members of the Elucidian Starstriders serving aboard the New Dawn, they have since succumbed to the Gellerpox. The Gellerpox Infected are ruled over by the Twisted Lords and led by Vulgrar Thrice-Cursed.[2a] Vulgrar Thrice-Cursed Nightmare Hulk

Void Claws (Warband)	The Void Claws are a Chaos Space Marine warband which took part in the Battle of Malak during the Arks of Omen Campaign.
Daemon Weapon	Daemon Weapons are gifts of the Gods of Chaos, used by Chaos Champions and Daemons. Bound (sometimes willingly) in the form of the weapon, and imprisoned there for an eternity, is the spirit of a Daemon. Daemon Weapons are only granted to the most powerful of a Chaos God's servants: Greater Daemons, Daemon Princes and still-mortal Champions of Chaos. Each weapon is unique and grants considerable power to those who wield it, however the daemon bound to the weapon can sometimes overcome the will of its would-be master. Willingly you picked me up. Your first mistake. Willingly you drew me. Your second mistake. I do not allow my servants to make three mistakes, foolish mortal...A Daemon Weapon, [2a]
Prismatic Ninefold	The Prismatic Ninefold is a Thousand Sons warband overseen by the Exalted Sorcerer Rasketh Quolinoch. Part of the Cult of Duplicity, it goes by many other names such as the Disciples of Change, Shadow Cell of Fractus I-X, and Cyclic Feverwrights.
Glooming Lords	The Glooming Lords are a Death Guard Warband. The warriors of the Glooming Lords are a morose band of killers who march into battle surrounded by colossal clouds of droning black daemon-flies. They are known to harbour a particular hatred for the sorcerous Warbands of Tzeentch, whose vibrant and colourful vigour they regard as being insufferable.
Maelstrom	The Maelstrom is a majoris grade interference between the warp and real space.[1a] Second only to the Eye of Terror in size, scope, and intensity, The Maelstrom is a massive Warp Storm and spatial vortex that lies near the center of the Galaxy. A place where the material universe and the Warp overlap, the laws of physics do not apply and it is infested with all kinds of cosmic horrors, such as Daemons and hordes of Chaos Mutants. Off limits to the Imperium, it has served as a refuge for pirates, brigands, outcasts, and Chaos Space Marines. A volatile region to live in, the Imperium struggles to retain control over the regions of space surrounding the Maelstrom Zone. The whole region itself is plagued by unpredictable spatial phenomena such as ionic reefs, null zones, and nomadic singularities. Warp travel is also highly unpredictable and hazardous, and this perhaps more than any other factor is responsible for the fact that the Maelstrom Zone has remained untamed by the Adeptus Terra.
Steel Heart	The Steel Heart are a Chaos Space Marine Renegade Chapter who were destroyed entirely in 801.M41 when Eldar forces of the Lugganath Craftworld attacked their stronghold. Their stronghold is known to have been located in the western quadrant of the Segmentum Obscurus.
Sons of Midnight	The Sons of Midnight are a Chaos Space Marine warband. Originally known as the Star Gryphons, they were among the thirty Chapters corrupted during the Abyssal Crusade.
Kha'Sherhan	The Kha'Sherhan were a warband of the Thousand Sons under the control of the Sorcerer Iskandar Khayon which later became part of the Black Legion.[1a] Operating from the warship Tlaloc which maintained an advanced Machine Spirit known as Anamnesis controlled by the Sorcerer Ashur-Kai Qezremah, the Kha'Sherhan eventually allied itself with Falkus Kibre and later Abaddon the Despoiler. After the Battle of Harmony which saw the Tlaloc destroyed, the warband was absorbed into the new Black Legion.[1a] At that time, it consisted of 104 Rubricae.[1b]
Voidrippers	The Voidrippers are a Khornate Chaos Space Marine Warband[1c] that is active in the Warp and the Caligari Sector.[1i] The Voidrippers were originally Space Marines of the Caligari Sector's Stormwatcher Chapter, who began to worship the Chaos God Khorne. Soon nearly the entire Chapter was in the Blood God's grasp and those Stormwatchers who refused to worship Khorne[1e], were viewed as traitors[1f] and were killed by their Heretic Battle Brothers. The Voidrippers were then born, when all of the Stormwatchers had been hunted down and killed or corrupted and joined the Warband's ranks. Afterwards, the majority of the Voidrippers began Crusades within the Warp[1e]; save for a few left slumbering on their Starfort[1c], Fort Blood[1g], with their Goreforged Cult servants[1c]. The Starfort was located in the Gwaelod System and was once known as the Fort of Echoes[1b]. It had originally served the Stormwatchers, before the Voidrippers corrupted the Starfort[1c] and Fort Blood now served as their only base in Realspace. The Voidrippers did not know, however, that a few of their loyalist Stormwatcher Battle Brothers had survived the Warband's purge. Over the next millennia, the survivors were able to rebuild the Chapter with the aid of the Inquisitors of the Caligari Conclave[1e] and in time, it was made a tradition that only the Chapter's Grand Master would learn its true history[1a]. Those who had survived the purge, would later be replaced with new Battle Brothers and eventually all save the Grand Masters, became unaware of how the Stormwatcher Chapter was nearly destroyed by their Heretic Battle Brothers[1i]. The Caligari Conclave would also work to ensure the Stormwatcherss' very existence became hidden from the wider Imperium as well. While the Chapter still carried out its duty to protect the Caligari Sector, these measures ensured the Voidrippers were unaware that they had failed to destroy the Stormwatchers[1e]. The Conclave and Stormwatchers would also mark the location of the Gwaelod System as being forbidden[1a], in order to prevent Fort Blood from being discovered[1e]. However, the Caligari Conclave made the mistake of keeping any knowledge of the Voidrippers and their connection to the Stormwatchers, only available to its high ranking members.[1e] This proved disastrous in M42, when a low-ranking Caligari Conclave Inquisitor was sent to aid the invaded Starfort of the Navigator House Ranieli. It had been attacked by the Word Bearers Warband of the Sorcerer Lord Rutial Glinthar, who ransacked the Ranieli's stored knowledge of the Caligari Sector. His sought to find the hidden Gwaelod System in order to destroy[1a] the Voidrippers[1c], after they had insulted the Word Bearers and defied the will of Abaddon the Despoiler. Due to the Caligari Conclave's efforts to keep the Stormwatcher Chapter's existence a secret, however, the location of the System was hard to find. Glinthar knew, though, that House Ranieli would have its location stored in the Starfort, as the House was known to serve the Conclave. The Sorcerer Lord was proven correct, when he found the Gwaelod System's location within a Warp Folio, but it was then that the Conclave's Inquisitor intervened. While he was heavily outnumbered, the Inquisitor managed to destroy Glinthar's Warband and claim the Warp Folio, before the Word Bearers could escape with it. The Inquisitor then became curious as to what Glinthar had sought in the Gwaelod System, despite being warned not to travel there, by the Conclave's head Inquisitor Lord Grigori Maldor. Even the Inquisitor's Stormwatcher retinue member, Sergeant Caius Thorn, warned against doing so, though, he did not know the true reason why it was forbidden. The Inquisitor, however, refused to heed their warnings, as he desired to uncover the mystery[1a], and immediately traveled to the Gwaelod System, with Sergeant Thorn in tow. They soon discovered the seemingly abandoned, Fort Blood and entered the Starfort. During the course of exploring it, the two discovered evidence that it was once used by the Stormwatcher Chapter and then began to reactivate the Starfort.[1b]
Gorefists	The Gorefists are a large Khornate Chaos Space Marine Warband, that took part in the Chaos God's Blood Crusade during the Thirteenth Black Crusade.
Malice (Chaos God)	Malice is an outcast Chaos God, representing anarchy incarnate. Other known names include The Renegade God, The Outcast, Hierarch of Anarchy and Terror, and The Lost. His symbol is a black and white skull. Malice represents the Warp's Chaotic and self-destructive tendencies, and is notable for his hatred of the major Gods of Chaos: Khorne, Tzeentch, Nurgle, and Slaanesh. Followers of Malice are prone to acts of anarchy, waging war upon not only the servants of the Imperium but also those of the other Gods of Chaos. In the Ætheric Dominions of Chaos, Malice represents "Ravenous Dissolution", the hatred that encompasses everything, even itself. Unlike the primary Chaos Gods, Malice can be summoned directly to the Materium provided enough mortal sacrifices are given and he is given a body to Daemonically possess.
Red Corsairs	The Red Corsairs are a Chaos Space Marine warband formed primarily from members of the Astral Claws chapter. The Red Corsairs are a Renegade Chapter and warband of Chaos Space Marines who lead a vast fleet of pirates composed of mortals and other Traitor Marines that threaten Imperial shipping and Imperial worlds near the Maelstrom Warp rift in the Ultima Segmentum, a region known as the Maelstrom Zone to Imperial astrocartographers. The Red Corsairs were once a Loyalist Space Marine Chapter called the Astral Claws who were based on the world of Badab Primaris in the Badab Sector of the Ultima Segmentum. The Astral Claws were, ironically, raised during the 10th Founding in the 35th Millennium to guard against the numerous daemonic and alien threats emerging from the Maelstrom. Under the leadership of their Chapter Master, Lugft Huron, the "Tyrant of Badab," in the late 41st Millennium, the Astral Claws sought to have the Badab Sector secede from the Imperium of Man in protest against the Imperium's continued attempts to use the resources of the Badab Sector outside the region rather than dedicating them fully to the defeat of the Chaotic and Xenos threats that emerged constantly from the Maelstrom Zone. The Astral Claws and the Tyrant of Badab were able to convince several other Astartes Chapters also dedicated to the protection of the Maelstrom Zone, including the Executioners, Lamenters, and the Mantis Warriors to stand with them against the Imperium in what they believed to be a just cause and an attempt to maintain the traditional autonomy of the Adeptus Astartes in the face of unwarranted interference from the Imperial nobility, economic interests and the often hated Inquisition.[Needs Citation] Unfortunately, Lugft Huron had slowly been corrupted by his desire for power into the service of Chaos, and eventually the Imperium was forced to respond to the Secessionists in the Maelstrom Zone by unleashing the full might of the Imperium in the terrible civil conflict that became known in the Imperial record, before the Inquisition laid down an Order of Obliteration that sought to remove all records of the Astral Claws' existence from Imperial history, as the Badab War. This conflict was fought between 901.M41 and 912.M41 and ended in the complete destruction of the Astral Claws' defences and the devastation of their Chapter homeworld of Badab Primaris. Only 200 Astral Claws survived the final Imperial assault, and these Astartes, all corrupted by Chaos, fled with the maimed body of their leader into the Maelstrom, where they founded a new Chaotic empire.
Sons of the Cyclops	The Sons of the Cyclops are a warband of the Black Legion named after the Primarch Magnus the Red. Perhaps the smallest warband within the Legion devoted to a single God of Chaos, they consist of Sorcerers and Rubric Marines. They nonetheless hold a disproportionate power within the Black Legion as some of Abaddon's most trusted advisers make up its leadership, most notably Ygethmor and Zaraphiston. They took part in the Diamor Campaign as a part of the Hand of Xorphas — the army of Chaos Sorcerer Xorphas. They later took part in the Nachmund Rift War.

He is the avatar of Khorne, embodying that god's indiscriminate rage and bloodlust.[1a] Khârn was born on Terra and inducted into the War Hounds Legion. Trained on Bodt by the War Hounds Master of Neophytes Gruner, Khârn eventually rose to become Captain of the 8th Assault Company.
Great Rift	The Great Rift, known to the Imperium as the Cicatrix Maledictum, is a new chain of catastrophic Warp Rifts that has divided much of the Galaxy. This new tear in reality was created at the end of the 41st Millennium during the Thirteenth Black Crusade following the destruction of Cadia. The origins of the Great Rift remain a mystery, with theories ranging from it forming due to the destruction of the Cadian Pylons at the end of the 13th Black Crusade, to sorcery used by Magnus the Red during the Siege of the Fenris System, to the awakening of Ynnead, mass bloodshed in the Damocles Gulf, and the reaction of the Ruinous Powers to the resurrection of Roboute Guilliman. Guilliman speculates that the Rift formed after Abaddon strategically destroyed worlds rich in Blackstone over ten thousand years, with the destruction of Cadia as its trigger. All that is truly known is that its emergence was a figuratively galaxy-shattering event that divided the Imperium in half and ushered in new wars across nearly every world in the Emperor's Empire. In a catastrophic event known as The Blackness, many worlds of the Imperium were cut off and overwhelmed by the Forces of Chaos as Warp Travel and Astropathic communication were rendered nigh-impossible.[4a] So powerful and far reaching was this Warp Storm, that the very laws of physics have begun to fray and the inconsistencies of time fluctuations, once largely localised to larger storms such as the Eye of Terror, have spread across the entire known galaxy. Since the Great Rift's creation, some worlds have felt centuries go by in an instant, while others have been all but frozen in time and still others have suffered constant temporal shifts.

Lorgar	"All I ever wanted was the truth"[8a] Lorgar Aurelian or the Urizen (meaning wisest of the wise in Colchisian[13b]) is the Primarch of the Word Bearers, one of the original twenty Space Marine Legions. Fiercely religious and prone to fanaticism, Lorgar yearned for a greater meaning to his existence besides conquest. This quest and the tragic events that befell his perfect city of Monarchia led him to become the first primarch to become seduced by the powers of Chaos. Hiding his new allegiance for many years, he helped to orchestrate the events that led to the Horus Heresy. He has since ascended to daemonhood and bares the self-appointed titles of Archpriest of the Primordial Truth and Minister of Chaos Absolute.[10b] The Primarch Lorgar vanished from the gene-labs on Luna while still an infant, along with the other twenty Primarchs. After his spiriting away by the forces of Chaos he was found on a desert feudal planet of Colchis. A nomadic tribe of outcasts known as The Declined under the chieftain Fan Morgal found the infant's shattered capsule and took him in. They named the child Lorgar, or the Rain-caller. Seventeen days later, Lorgar, already grown to the size of a young child, was discovered by Kor Phaeron an exiled priest of the Covenant. Immediately sensing greatness in the boy and believing him blessed by The Powers, Kor Phaeron convinced Lorgar to become his disciple and promptly killed Fan Morgal and his tribe to cover up the boy's identity. Despite enduring Kor Phaeron's vicious abuses, Lorgar fervently believed in the Covenant and researched every aspect of it that he could find, coming to the conclusion that there was a The One that binded the polytheistic Covenant together. Kor Phaeron dismissed such notions initially and often abused Lorgar physically and emotionally. At the same time, Kor Phaeron saw something special in Lorgar and attempted to manipulate him in order to rule over Colchis. Nonetheless, Lorgar remained intensely loyal to Kor Phaeron and even saved his life in a crew mutiny. Lorgar also grew close to those in Kor Phaeron's caravan, which included the captain Axata and slave Nairo.

Instead, Typhus sent the Faithful and the Sorcerer Yharron Thayl's Subtle Blades Warband to prevent House Raven's Knights from aiding Metalica.[1b] However, when the two arrived in House Raven's Sub-sector, Lirac, they ignored the Traveller's orders and instead began their own agenda.

Perturabo	"'You don't know the things I dream. No one does, no one ever cared enough to find out."[7c] Perturabo is the Primarch of the Iron Warriors, one of the original twenty Space Marine Legions. Bitter and feeling marginalized by the Imperium, he sided with Horus during the Horus Heresy and has since ascended to Daemonhood. He, like his Iron Warriors, had a natural affinity towards technology and a cold logic, but lacked the strength of faith. According to Perturabo himself, he is estimated to have been born around 792.M30. When the primarchs were scattered to the ends of the galaxy, Perturabo landed on a planet named Olympia. For at least a year, he was alone in the rural regions of Olympia and became a famed wanderer that would slay legendary beasts. However, he was first discovered climbing the mountains below the city state of Lochos with no memory of anything prior.[12a] The guards, having realised this was no normal child, brought him before the Dammekos, the Tyrant of Lochos. Dammekos was intrigued by the child and brought him into his house and treated him as family. Dammekos noticed the boy's overwhelming intellect and skill with everything from architecture to the arts to political debate to combat, and he became a wonder with which Lochos secured alliances with other city-states. The young Perturabo, though he knew he was not of this world and was made by design as opposed to nature, was disgusted by the religious Olympians and believed in the cold logic of science and reason.[12a]

However, due to The Blackness, the Weeping Veil were unable to locate Sabatine's exact location, no matter what sorcery or instruments they used. Their salvation came when the Lords of Silence Warband approached the Ayamandar aboard the Solace. The Lords of Silence also sought to attack Sabatine and its Chaos Lord, Vorx, offered to lead the Weeping Veil to the world, if the Chapter agreed to combine their forces for the invasion.[1a] After some consideration Mor agreed[1c], though the Dark Apostle planned on betraying the Lords of Silence once Sabatine was conquered.[1a]

In Dionys wake did the levels of mutation and cultist activity rose dramatically and the Chapters caught in it had their gene-seed corrupted.

Vashtorr	Vashtorr the Arkifane is a powerful Daemon and the ruler of the Forge of Souls. He claims to forgo allegiance to any Chaos God and commands his own army known as the Cult of the Arkifane. Having long kept himself shrouded from most races, Vashtorr is a demi-god of inventors, engineers, scientists, and artisans. He is empowered by acts of curiosity (like Slaanesh) and innovation (like Tzeentch) in the Materium, shorn of morality and driven to its darkest extremes. He has only manifested a handful of times in galactic history, and some crypto-scholars maintain he was created amidst the reckless arms race of some ancient galaxy-spanning war. Others propose he was brought about by the horrors of the Dark Age of Technology, where he proved a patron to many of its technological horrors. He is also said to have been empowered by events such as the rise of the Necrons, the Cursed Founding, and the creation of Primaris Space Marines. Vashtorr is not a slave of any of the four great Chaos Gods, instead maintaining his own sphere of influence and unique role within the Warp. He is the lord of the Forge of Souls, having grown powerful bartering souls with any Daemon or damned individual that seeks his services in the acquisition of Daemonic weaponry. Other are simply enslaved to his will and forced to join the ranks of his own armies.

His actions after the Heresy - particularly creating and enacting the great spell that bears his name — would result in his eventual banishment from the Legion he had spent most of his existence trying to safeguard.

Festerlung Brotherhood	The Festerlung Brotherhood are a Death Guard Warband. Under the command of the Chaos Lord Ghloxas, the Warband attacked the Imperial Jhorvian System, and began the Ghloxas Heresy. However when they invaded the Agri World Jhorvia V, the Radical Inquisitor Vincenze Farradocias Kazymar intervened. He soon unleashed the Prr'xakkatos Tzeentch Daemonhost upon the Festerlung, which had fought the Warband before in the Bokha's Sound Massacres. What followed was a three way battle between the Festerlung, the Imperial forces defending Jhorvia V and the Daemons of the Prr'xakkatos. The Daemonhost proved to be too powerful, though, and inflicted horrible losses on the Festerlung Brotherhood and killed Lord Ghloxas. Though Kazymar attempted to destroy the Brotherhood and Daemons with an orbital bombardment, he was attacked by Inquisitor Danicha Hest which sent the Radical fleeing. Now the Brotherhood and Prr'xakkatos Daemonhost have been left to fight each other amidst the ruins of Jhorvia V.

Chaos Cult	Chaos Cults are the most dangerous of all those who plot to overthrow the rule of the Imperium from within. All planets and civilisations belonging to the Imperium can harbour Chaos organisations, which themselves are as diverse in practice and membership as is imaginable. From the blood-soaked sacrificial cults of feral worlds to the philosophical secret societies of more advanced worlds, the temptations of Chaos can capture all. Indeed, according to the Ordo Hereticus, Chaos Cults can arise from any class of Imperial society, be it impoverished, noble, hive-gang, abhuman, soldiers, or mutant. The objective of the Chaos Cult is to survive and eventually dominate the society. Mere survival is particularly important on Imperial worlds, where Chaos worship is the greatest of heresies and Inquisitors are always vigilant and ready to wipe out any taint of Chaos. One technique, the Bone-brand, enables cultists to know one another with outsiders being none the wiser.
Red Wolves (Warband)	The Red Wolves are a Red Corsairs Warband, that is composed of the Space Wolves who surrendered to Huron Blackheart after he successfully boarded the Strike Cruiser Wolf of Fenris. They have now fully turned upon the Imperium and use the Wolf of Fenris as their base of operations. However, while they serve the Red Corsairs, the Red Wolves will disobey any order that keeps them from fighting or the chance to take plunder.
Nightwing (Warband)	The Nightwing are a warband of Night Lords Chaos Space Marines. Its leader, Hemek, expressed strong desire to join with Abaddon the Despoiler in the 13th Black Crusade. They later took part in the Nachmund Rift War.
Swords of Khargoth	The Swords of Khargoth are a warband of Renegade Space Marines, formerly of the Swords of Praesium Chapter. When Chaos forces attacked the world of Acropolis Vega, two Companies from the Swords of Praesium Chapter launched a counter-attack. Not long after they made planetfall, a warp storm engulfed the system, cutting off Acropolis Vega from the outside for nearly 70 years. No records survived attesting to how long the Space Marines fought against the warriors of the dark gods, but eventually they succumbed. Isolated and almost certainly overwhelmed by their opposition, several squads evidently swore their loyalty to Chaos in return for their survival. When the Warp Storm abated, it was the Swords of Khargoth who led the attack upon the Imperial reclamation fleet. Ever since, the Swords of Khargoth have been known as bloody reavers who delight in the slaughter of boarding actions. Though the Imperial Guard eventually retook Acropolis Vega, the Swords of Khargoth escaped destruction and their strike cruisers now menace Imperial shipping and small outposts in the area.
Vehement Chorus	The Vehement Chorus is a Black Legion warband of particularly devout Chaos Space Marines led by Abaddon's trusted lieutenant Emerys Varran.

Sons of the Eye	The Sons of the Eye were a warband of the Sons of Horus and part of the Thrice-Cursed Traitors.[1b] They wore a twisted version of the Eye of Horus on their armor, cut through as to demonstrate that the blindness of Horus had led his legion to destruction.[1b] Originally part of the Sons of Horus, the Sons of the Eye were a splinter group of escapees from Maeleum commanded by Drecarth the Sightless.[1a] They rejected both their old Primarch Horus as well as Abaddon as a usurper. As a result, they refused to join the Black Legion.[1b] Drecarth proved to be a capable leader, and the Sons of the Eye prospered under his command.[1a] Abaddon was eventually warned by his cabal of sorcerers that Drecarth was a potential threat and would try to take control of the Black Legion. The Black Legion leader consequently lured the Sons of the Eye into a false sense of security by offering peace and an alliance. The two forces proceeded to launch the 6th Black Crusade, together winning a great victory. At their moment of triumph, however, Drecarth was killed by Abaddon, and the surviving Sons of the Eye agreed to join the Black Legion.[1a]
Warriors of Aggannor	The Warriors of Aggannor are a Chaos Space Marine Warband. It is an amalgamation of Chaos Space Marines from many Chapters and Traitor Legions, such as the Night Lords and Word Bearers, who have sworn allegiance to the Chaos Lord Aggannor. They were formed by Aggrannor during the Reign of Blood, in order to attack Calibos III.
Shatter Corps	The Shatter Corps are a Iron Warriors Warband that is active in the Screaming Vortex. The Shatter Corps contains numerous warriors, as well as a great many powerful war machines that were recently liberated from the nearby Spinward Front, and have since been corrupted into Daemon Engines due to the efforts of the Warband's Warpsmith, Gracix. Under the command of the Warsmith Madrydon Drados, the Shatter Corps seeks to destroy the Imperium's many fortifications and fortresses throughout the Sectors that lay near the Screaming Vortex. By doing so, Drados believes the Imperium would soon topple beneath its own weight and leave itself open to be attacked by the forces of Chaos.
Horde of Misery	The Horde of Misery are a Chaos Space Marine warband.
The Pyre	The Pyre are a Chaos Space Marine warband. Chaos Space Marines wearing the insignias of the Pyre warband were first observed near the Eye of Terror in 131.M41. There are no confirmed records of encounters with the warband prior to this time. Munitorum analysts have not been able to determine if the Pyre splintered from another known warband, or if they were assembled from fragments of several different groups. Since that time, units wearing modified version of Pyre wargear have been observed on several occasions. There are no indications that this warband has sworn fealty to any specific god of Chaos. Rather, they have been seen to coordinate their battles with servants of all the dark gods, which have included daemonic and cultist elements.
Daemon Engine	A Daemon Engine is a part-technological, part-daemonic vehicle employed by the various forces of Chaos. Daemon Engines can vary greatly in form and function, but they are unified by one factor - the physical shells of the vehicles contain bound Daemons which control their actions. Daemon Engines have an insatiable bloodlust and revel in violence and destruction. Often they will destroy anything that lies in their path, regardless of allegiance, and so must be chained up until they can be unleashed upon the enemy. Like all entities of the Warp, Daemon Engines exude an aura of death and hatred that can overwhelm a lesser man. Untainted humans near one of these beasts often fall to their knees in horror and the demons presence fills their minds.[Needs Citation] Creating a Daemon Engine requires that the entity be summoned by one who has knowledge of such things, such as a Chaos Warpsmith, sorcerer or priest. The Daemon is summoned into the hull of the machine so that the corruption spreads throughout its circuits, gaining complete control of all functions.[Needs Citation] The complex process also involves the creation of Weapon-slaves.
Konrad Curze	"Death is nothing compared to vindication" Konrad Curze, also known as Night Haunter, was one of the twenty Primarchs created by the Emperor. Raised on the hellish world of Nostramo and plagued by prophetic visions of death, Curze became known as one of the most brutal and unstable Primarchs, a creature of terror and darkness that set him apart from many of his brothers. Ultimately he betrayed the Emperor and joined with Warmaster Horus in the Horus Heresy. The Chaos emissary to Lorgar called him the Killer. The child that would come to be known as Konrad Curze was first recorded as crashing through the surface and into the core of the night-shrouded world of Nostramo. The crust of Nostramo bore high quantities of the mineral adamantium, which provided the basis of the planet's immense mining and purifying industries. The vast majority of the planet's population lived in abject poverty, toiling in the mines while the rich grew in affluence, exploiting the already downtrodden workers. Crime ran mostly unchecked, depression was inescapable, and overpopulation was kept in check more by suicide than by any other measure.
Prophets of the Blighted Path	The Prophets of the Blighted Path are a Word Bearers warband led by Dark Apostle Naberus and have long been active in the Screaming Vortex. They maintain an orbital fortress trailing the world known as the Flaming Tomb in the Inner Vortex.
Tempest Legion	The Revelation of Gore are a Chaos Space Marine warband. Originally known as the Tempest Legion, they were among the thirty Chapters corrupted during the Abyssal Crusade.
Legion Host	The Legion Host was a massive Chaos Space Marine Warband that was commanded by the Death Guard Sorcerer Lord Thagus Daravek during the Legion Wars.[1a] Though initially composed of Daravek's own Death Guard forces, as the Warband grew in size and influence it began to accept members and Warbands from the other Traitor Legions within the Eye of Terror. Soon the Legion Host was the most massive Warband taking part in the Legion Wars and were only rivaled in size by the Black Legion. This eventually caused Daravek and Abaddon to become rivals as the two Lords sought to become the new Warmaster of Chaos and succeed the Primarch Horus Lupercal[1a]. This conflict came to a head, when Abaddon and the Black Legion escaped from the Eye of Terror[1b], to obtain the Daemon sword Drach'nyen[1c], and Daravek led the Legion Host in pursuit of them[1d], as he also coveted the sword[1c]. When the Legion Host caught up with the Black Legion, Abaddon's Warband was fighting the Black Templars Chapter within the Cadian Gate and Daravek ordered his Warband to attack his rival's fleet[1d]. This began the First Battle of Cadia, but the Legion Host's attack did not go as planned though, as many of the Black Legion's ships escaped from the battle and Daravek himself was killed by the Sorcerer Khayon[1e]. After the Sorcerer Lord's death, the Legion Host separated into groups of ships and fled into the Warp. These groups then preyed upon the unsuspecting Imperium worlds of Segmentum Obscurus during the First Black Crusade, though some would eventually join their former enemies and become a part of the Black Legion.[1f]
Typhus	"I shall reap a terrible bounty from the death that I sow in your name. Father Nurgle..."[9b] Typhus the Traveller, Herald of Nurgle, is a Chaos Space Marine of the Death Guard Traitor Legion. Typhus was born Calas Typhon on the Death Guard's eventual homeworld of Barbarus. Typhon was a half-breed, the result of one of the Overlords of Barbarus taking a liking to his human mother. For this, his mother's fellow villagers drowned her.[19b] As a child upon the toxic planet of Barbarus, Calas Typhon was troubled by nightly phenomena over which he believed he had no control. Objects would shudder and smash around him whenever he was frightened or angered, and plants would wither and die under his gaze. These phantom powers troubled him greatly, but he resolved to turn them to his advantage. By the time Typhon reached maturity, he had learned to master the psychic energies that resonated within him each night; a feat of will that impressed his elders mightily. With this act, Typhon became stronger in his resolve to succeed than any of his peers. When Mortarion defected from the Overlords after witnessing their atrocities, Typhon was the first person the Primarch encountered and the young child helped lead him to safety.[19a] During his early adulthood, Typhus was a champion of Mortarion's early Death Guard in his war against the Warlord of Barbarus. When the Emperor reclaimed his lost son Mortarion from the poisonous mists of Barbarus, and reunited him with the superhuman warriors born from his gene-seed, Typhon was amongst those chosen to join their ranks. As he joined the legion, his psychic potential was suppressed through training due to the anti-psyker sentiment of his Primarch. Nonetheless through his rugged talent, Typhon was eventually able to rise to the prestigious position of First Captain.[12a] He shared a strong bond with Mortarion, the two being close comrades due in part to their shared origin as outsiders even among Barbarus.[17b]
Rotworm Brotherhood	The Rotworm Brotherhood are a Chaos Space Marine warband of the Death Guard. This warband is led by a conclave of Sorcerers who rebelled against Mortarion. They raise cults of mortal worshippers across the Imperium, their task to multiply like bacilli and spread the worship of Nurgle. The warband formed a pact with House Mandrakor to defend Dharrovar from Imperial assault.
The Masque	The Masque of Slaanesh is a Daemonette and was once Slaanesh's favoured dancer and chief handmaiden until she was cast out by her master. Now she is forced to dance through the mortal and immortal worlds for eternity. During the eternal conflict that is the Great Game, Tzeentch tricked Slaanesh into battling with Khorne, a war that it could not possibly hope to win, and Slaanesh was defeated and humiliated. Seeing the dark mood of her master, the Masque took it upon herself to please it with her most energetic and scintillating dance ever. However, instead of his usual laughter and joy at such a sight, Slaanesh saw mockery and attacks on his wounded pride in each perfect combination of moves that the Masque executed. It condemned her as a traitor, and cursed her, proclaiming that if she wanted to dance, she must dance forever more. And so the Masque was forced to dance for all eternity, across space and time, for both mortal and immortal audiences. As she re-enacts Slaanesh's greatest conquest and victories, her mask changes to match the roles of the characters she plays. So powerful is the lure of the Masque's display that those who see it are inevitably compelled to join in the performance. Even Daemons are not exempt from the Masque's enchantments. As the dance goes on, the tempo rises, while the Masque's unwitting chorus struggles desperately to keep up, and eventually dance themselves to death, using up their last ounce of strength and dying breath to keep pace with her twirls and somersaults.
Subtle Blades	The Subtle Blades[1e] are an Alpha Legion[1a] Warband led by the Sorcerer Yharron Thayl.[1a] During the Charadon Campaign, Typhus the Traveller sought numerous Chaos forces to aid his conquest of Metalica. Thayl led[1a] 2 Companies of the Warband[1e] to aid him[1a], but they would not take part in invading the Forge World. Instead, Typhus sent the Subtle Blades and the Dark Apostle Tsorr'Kanath's Faithful Warband to prevent House Raven's Knights from aiding Metalica.[1b] However, when the two arrived in House Raven's Sub-sector, Lirac, they ignored the Traveller's orders and instead began their own agenda. Thayl and Tsorr'Kanath then combined their Warbands together into the Disciples[1c] and on Dhaku, they achieved their first goal by capturing a Patriarch of the Innerwyrm Cult.[1d]
Void Stalker	The Void Stalker is one of the largest Eldar space vessels after the Craftworld. The Void Stalker represents the pinnacle of Eldar technology and many are known to have taken part in the Gothic War. When the Eldar pirate fleets allied with Lord Admiral Ravensburg after the Battle of Gethsemane, the Void Stalkers were brought into service, previously not having been seen during the entire war. They are strong and powerful with various weapons including Pulsar Lances, Eldar Weapons Batteries and Eldar Launch Bays with Darkstar Fighters and Eagle Bombers. Other Void Stalkers during the Gothic War pursued personal vendettas while the whole region was in turmoil.
Harvest	The Harvest are a Khorne Warband.[1a] Unlike other Khorne Warbands, who think nothing of throwing themselsves at their foes, the Harvest cast themselves as defenders rather than attackers. By doing so they guarantee that enough blood will be spilled, so that the Daemons of Khorne will be able to materialize from the Warp and join the Warband in slaughtering their foes. This tactic makes the Harvest eager for battle, yet they have little patience for building fortifications themselves. Instead, the Warband targets a world that lies in the path of a vast, onrushing threat such as an Ork Waaagh! or Tyranid splinter fleet. Using massed packs of Warp Talons to tear a breach in reality itself, the Harvest appear at the very heart of the positions held by the world's defenders. With their eyes fixed upon the impending invasion, the defenders are caught utterly by surprise and, more often then not, are quickly massacred by the Harvest. The Warband then reconsecrates their newly stolen strongholds to Khorne with the blood of the slain, and wait for the full fury of the impending foe to break upon them like a glorious, terrible storm.[1a] Harvest Chaos Space Marine[1b]
The Tormented	The Tormented are a warband of the Black Legion. Made up of Possessed Chaos Space Marines, they have their origins during the Legion's time on Maeleum. The Daemons that possess the warriors of The Tormented have their own agendas and will act upon them when opportunities arise, making this warband unpredictable in battle.
Maws of the Arena	The Maws of the Arena are a World Eaters Warband.
The Riven	The Riven are a warband of the Black Legion composed of Secondborn who act as the guardians of the Vengeful Spirit.[1b] The Riven are a warband of Secondborn within the Black Legion with a brutal reputation. Originally the Triarii of the World Eaters,[1a] they gradually became a host of Secondborn as mortally wounded warriors were bound with daemons by Iskandar Khayon and their ranks were joined by possessed volunteers, largely from the Sons of Horus, and prisoners from other Legions.[1c] Charged with protecting the Vengeful Spirit, they fought off boarding actions by both the Black Templars[1c] and the Legion Host during the First Battle of Cadia.[1d]
Savagers	The Savagers are an Iron Warriors Warband, that specializes in void-warfare. They are among the Traitor Legion's forces, that have pledged ritualized oaths to the Effacers of Medrengard Warsmith Czagra. This has placed the Savagers under his command and they are currently among Czagra's hordes taking part in Abaddon the Despoiler's Ark of Omen Campaign.
Prism of Fate	The Prism of Fate are a warband of the Thousand Sons. The Prism of Fate has always prided itself on the diversity of psychic disciplines amongst its ranks. They once ensured that adherents from each of the cults of Prospero could be counted amongst their number, the better to steer their brotherhoods through whatever challenges their Primarch — and their Emperor — should ask of them. Since the devastation of the Heresy, the Prism’s Sorcerers have focused ever more obsessively on the diversity of deaths they can inflict upon their foes. Its Sorcerers take pride in never slaying one victim in the same way as another – their longevity is such that imagination is counted the most kingly of virtues.
Grey Glaives	The Grey Glaives are a Chaos Space Marine Warband, whose forces are the size of an army.
Zkolar's Graven Lords	Zkolar's Graven Lords are a Black Legion warband that was part of Haarken Worldclaimer's host during the Sangua Terran War.
Ripping Nails	The Ripping Nails are an Emperor's Children Warband.
Ushmengar	The Ushmengar are a Chaos Space Marine warband pledged to the Daemon Vashtorr. The Ushmengar were originally a group of Astral Claws which had fled the Maelstrom Zone after Huron's defeat in the Badab War. However they became lost in the Warp and in desperation pledged themselves to Vashtorr. Their service with Vashtorr has seen them mutated into a hideous fusion of man and machine. The warband is being tracked down by a group of Executioners after their Penitent Crusade is over, with a force mostly comprising of Primaris Marines.
Hounds of Abaddon	The Hounds of Abaddon are a Khorne-affiliated warband of the Black Legion. Reveling in close combat like true devotees of Khorne, the Hounds of Abaddon are not a single unified warband but rather are a mob of vicious warriors led by Urkanthos, commander of the Black Legion's Fleet. Since the 13th Black Crusade, they have been led by Threxos Hellbreed. They adorn their armour and weapons in both black and red to showcase their dual loyalty to Abaddon as well as Khorne.
Festering Scar	The Festering Scar are a Death Guard Warband. Unlike the majority of the Death Guard's Warbands, the Festering Scar are among the few who have rebelled against their Daemon Primarch Mortarion's muster to war. Instead, they have abandoned his crusade against the Imperium in favour of spreading the gifts of Nurgle to the many Xenos races that inhabit the galaxy.
Tainted Souls	The Tainted Souls are a Chaos Space Marine Warband. They were among the many Warbands that were defeated in battle by the Crimson Sabres, when the cursed Chapter sought to martyr itself within the Eye of Terror.
Syll'Esske	Syll'Esske is the name given to an unholy union of a Slaanesh Daemon Prince and one of the Dark Prince's Daemon Heralds. The Daemonic Herald Syll Lewdtongue was once shunned by those in Slaanesh's court for growing too attached to those meant to be tempted into their own destruction. Syll's affection for these mortals would eventually lead to glory when a mortal gladiator-slave in Slaanesh's garden known as Esske caught the Herald's eye. Esske's newfound patronage allowed him to ascend all the way to Daemonhood, only to be dismissed by Slaanesh Daemon courtiers due to his status as a former mortal. In response, Syll and Esske joined forces to take revenge on those that had shunned them, working closely in battle to complement each other's strengths. Fighting to the throne of Slaanesh itself, the two bound their fates in a dark pact. They became a symbiotic entity known as Syll'Esske, fighting with deadly synchronicity. The alliance which had made them outsiders before, now paved the way for their mutual ascension.
Extinction (Short Story)	Extinction is a short story by Aaron Dembski-Bowden. The Horus Heresy is over. The traitorous Warmaster is dead, his allies defeated, and the Sons of Horus are a dying Legion, fled now to the furthest reaches of the galaxy... and beyond. First Captain Ezekyle Abaddon, always among the most devoted and bellicose of his brethren, is now set adrift – who will rise to claim the title of Warmaster?

Tainted Cohort	Felthius is a Death Guard Lord of Contagion and commands the Tainted Sons Warband.[1a] His origins are clouded in mystery, but the Death Guard in his Warband claim Felthius was once a slave that was dropped in the noxious pits of the Plague Planet. Most who suffer such a fate experience horrid deaths, but Felthius thrived and eventually earned the right to join the ranks of the Death Guard. No one but he knows if this is true, but since his rise hundreds of years ago, Felthius has become a powerful and effective commander. He has led the Tainted Sons to victory over the armies of dozens of Imperial worlds and has captured an Emperor's Spears' Strike Cruiser, which became his flagship, Rotbringer. In battles, Felthius can be found where the fighting is the thickest, and each of his victories bring him one step closer to becoming a Daemon Prince.[1a] Since the Great Rift's creation, Felthius has taken part in the Plague Wars and now resides in the Scourge Stars, where he and the Tainted Sons continue to strike at the Realm of Ultramar[1a]
Red Cadavers	The Red Cadavers are a Khorne Warband know for their fury-pandemics.
Wolves of Horus	The Wolves of Horus are a warband of the Sons of Horus and one of the Thrice-Cursed Traitors, those who turned their back on Abaddon the Despoiler after he took command of the remnants of the Sons of Horus, refusing to become part of the Black Legion. The death of Horus left many veteran Legionaries craving for the days of the Luna Wolves, and the Wolves of Horus chose to relive those early times, venerating their dead Primarch Horus by bearing his name.

Perfecti	"Perfecti! Show me your skill!"- Knight-Commander Marduk Tamaris[1a] The Perfecti are a Warband in the Emperor's Children's 3rd Company and are led by the Knight-Commander Marduk Tamaris.[1a] In M42, the Sorcerer Lord Mauvais appeared before them, just as the Perfecti were about to achieve a victory over a World Eaters Warband. Mauvais then delivered a message from their Daemon Primarch Fulgrim, that the Emperor's Children's forces were to join his side aboard the warship Vexation. With the World Eaters now defeated, Tamaris gave the order for the Perfecti to ready themselves to answer their Primarch's summons.[1a]
Screaming Skulls	The Screaming Skulls were once a loyal Space Marine Chapter, until they were converted to the worship of Nurgle by the Plague Marine Korpharact the Contaminated.
Warp Ghosts	The Warp Ghosts are a Chaos Space Marine warband which serve as the ferrymen of the Eye of Terror.[3a] The Warp Ghosts are a mysterious entity similar to the loyalist Legion of the Damned. A warband of spectral Chaos Space Marines existing between both life and death, they give off an eerie green glow. In M31, Iskandar Khayon did not recognize pattern of their armour and ships, commenting that it looked futuristic compared to what even the Imperium at the time fielded. The origin of the Warp Ghosts and what they are remain unclear, any attempt to have them explain their origin or intent is met with them proclaiming it irrelevant. Even the Ordo Malleus has few picts of their existence. The Warp Ghosts serve as the ferrymen of the Eye of Terror. If a price is paid, they will escort those within the Eye to safe exit routes such as the Cadian Gate. They also operate as regular mercenaries and marauders.[3a] Being only a warband, they have far less marines and equipment compared to the Traitor Legions, but are renowned for their ferocity,[3c] having earned a reputation as "world-breakers".[3a] In addition, they field an extremely powerful fleet which includes ships of Imperial and Xenos design.[3a] The Warp Ghosts also operate a heavily armored contingent known as the Stygian Vanguard which is known to operate Typhon Heavy Siege Tanks.[3c]
Skull-eaters	The Skull-eaters are a Black Legion Warband.
Pus Brothers	The Pus Brothers are a Death Guard Vectorium, of the 3rd Plague Company. They were among the Death Guard's forces that took part in the Chromyd Front, under the command of the Chaos Lord Thraxoplasmox. During that battle, the Pus Brothers invaded the Industrial World Okharium and laid siege to the vital Ferrumore Prefabricum XIX. With the aid of the Putrid Choir and the Dolorous Gnaw Vectoriums, the Ferrumore was under the Death Guard's firm stranglehold despite its Imperial forces preventing them from fully claiming it. However, their hold was later decisively broken by an assault led by the Blood Vipers Captain Xanthin Atris, which allowed fresh Imperial forces to reach the Ferrumore.

They launched the Invasion of Taladorn but were defeated by a coalition of Imperial Fists, Ultramarines, and Blood Angels forces. Later, they (along with their Ork allies) were defeated by the Imperial Fists in the Fall of Malodrax. The Warband then took part in invading the Imperial Fists' Phalanx Fortress-Monastery, alongside the Daemonic hordes of the Daemon Prince Be'lakor, but met with catastrophic disaster in the conflict. Though the invasion had started well for the Warband and Daemon hordes, they were eventually defeated by the Imperial Fists' forces, led by Third Captain Tor Garadon, and the Legion of the Damned. The Warband is believed to have been destroyed in the failed invasion and even Shon'tu himself was killed in the conflict.

Originally loyalist, in 721.M39 it fell to Chaos after the Chapter Master was led down a path of retribution when he mistakenly believed the Imperial Governor of Hyboras has stolen the Chapter's ancient relic blade. His Chapter committed a series of atrocities on the feral world, but only when the Chapter Master sat on the Governor's gore-stained throne did he realise the extent of his folly, though by then it was too late. When the Black Legion arrived, the Savage Swords had already fallen to the worship of Khorne and joined Abaddon eagerly.

Primarch	The Primarchs were the twenty genetically-engineered "sons" of the Emperor of Mankind, and the genetic "fathers" of the Space Marine Legions. The Emperor used his own DNA in their creation, and they were designed to be far superior to the average human: immensely larger, stronger, hardier, faster, and more intelligent. They were also incredibly charismatic, as their main role was to be generals and leaders of the Imperial military. Each had their own purpose and specialty, allowing them to serve in specific functions that the Emperor's forces would need in reconquering the galaxy. Originally, Primarch was simply a martial rank of the Thunder Warriors. Each of the twenty legions of Thunder Warriors was led by a "Primarch". However, these warriors were no different than those they led. Instead, they were officers of superlative skill promoted to the position by the Emperor. One of the known Thunder Warrior Primarchs was Ushotan. The Primarchs were created in a secret underground laboratory on Terra under the tightest security. According to Ingethel the Ascended, the Primarchs were created by the Emperor with the aid of forbidden sciences and arcane lore derived from the Warp. Eldrad Ulthran also states that the Emperor utilized dark powers to construct the Primarchs. It is speculated the Primarchs were imbued with energies and knowledge that the Emperor gained in a Warp Portal on Molech. The genetic material of the powerful Perpetual Erda were used in the creation of the Primarchs and she viewed them as her "sons".[38a] Perturabo would later estimate his own birth to be 792.M30, perhaps giving a date for the Primarch's creation.

Though they suffer the effects of the Rubric of Ahriman like all of their kind, Seth's Chosen still possess a will to know the secrets of the galaxy. They have thus willingly allowed themselves to become conduits for the Gatekeeper's psychic power, which has increased their durability beyond the already legendary resilience Rubric Marines are known for.
Servants of the Abyss	The Servants of the Abyss are a Chaos Space Marine Warband that command a large number of Traitor Guard. Some time after the Great Rift's creation, the Servants of the Abyss's Dread Cruiser Impaler, was struck by a empyric cataclysm, that fused it to a new Blackstone Fortress that has appeared in the Galaxy. Since then, they have become trapped within the vast Xenos structure and the Warband's Chaos Lord Obsidius Mallex now seeks to seize control of the new Blackstone Fortress. Obsidius Mallex
Shadowed Ones	The Shadowed Ones was an Alpha Legion warband led by Dynat Crowbane Mal. Taking refuge in the Mandragoran Stars after the Scouring, Mal gathered together a force of traitors and renegades and brought destruction to much of what would become the Orpheus Sector, including scouring the world of Amarah in M31.

The Violators' armour is blue and is often stained with juices of their mutated bodies that runs from the joints.[3d] Their chapter symbol is a lightning bolt crossed with a dagger. They are known to use electrical pulses to stimulate certain parts of the brain to increase pleasure. A Violator's mutated body is a temple to Slaanesh, who looks favourably on the Chapter and often alters their bodies so their sensations and pleasures are more immediate. Many Violators have never removed a single part of their armour, for showing their true body would be sacrilege. Though some may reveal themselves in the presence of those who truly represent the ideals of Slaanesh or to a great enemy before the kill.[3c]
Helhawks	The Helhawks are a Chaos Space Marine Warband.

Sectai Prosperine	The Sectai Prosperine are a warband of the Thousand Sons. The Sectai Prosperine was originally a gathering of minor sects hailing from the fringes of the Thousand Sons hierarchy. In an effort to increase their knowledge and influence alike, the Sorcerers leading these cults banded together as a single organisation, relegating their personal heraldry to symbolic runes and donning the azure, gold and purple of Prospero’s ruling caste. In combining their efforts, they surpassed all but the greatest of their rivals in terms of power. They now consider themselves the inheritors of Prospero’s true legacy, embracing that planet’s dark fate instead of running from it as have so many of their kin The sub-colours of Sectai Prosperine tabards originate from when they were comprised of the three autonomous factions - pale green for the Bringers of Spiritual Dawn, white for the Learned Mysticae and purple for the Brethren of the Amethyst Sun.

Bereft of clear leadership, the Skull-scythes allowed the Dark Angels' Third Company to regroup and come back to destroy what remained of Furion's forces.
Daemon Prince	Daemon Princes are former mortal Champions of Chaos who have been elevated to daemonhood by the Gods of Chaos. They have bartered their humanity for unearthly power and immortality.[4a][5b] In order to attract the attention of their patrons, Chaos Champions have to perform great and terrible deeds. They sacrifice enemies and allies alike for their ambitions and risk their demise at the hands of both their foes and gods. The few that manage to avoid death and spawndom are changed beyond recognition.[4a][5b] While Daemon Princes come in various shapes, most are of hulking stature, displaying numerous mutations such as horns and wings. Even more notable are the supernatural powers they wield, some of which are associated with their patron god.[5b] What they maintain of former selves are the driving ambition and ruthless cunning which helped them earn their ultimate reward.
Lucius (Emperor's Children)	Brothers! Welcome to the feast! Tell me, which among you will be the first course?" Lucius the Eternal is a space marine of the Emperor's Children. He is a Champion of Slaanesh, and is also known as The Soulthief, Fulgrim's Champion, and the Scion of Chemos. He fought amongst members of Squad Nasicae during the reconquest of Istvaan III,[11a] who went on to become his bodyguard, and eventually his warband. Ultimately, Lucius organized a coalition of Chaos Space Marines dubbed the "Faultless".[17d] During his youth on Chemos, Lucius became noted for his talent and ability to master nearly any skill. He quickly gained sponsors among the elites of the planet and he gravitated towards the art of war, most notably swordsmanship. He displayed perhaps sadistic tendencies early on, killing individuals he claimed were beggars and brigands that had attacked him first. He proved to be a poor teacher, often scarring his pupils or cutting off an eye or finger in an "accident". When he took part in an annual swordsmanship contest on Chemos, Lucius garnered the attention of a hulking stranger in the shadows. He dueled against a famed champion twice his age, and after suffering a blow to his stomach, took apart his opponent piece by piece. As he was about to be attacked by the champion's supporters and disciples, Lucius was saved by a Sergeant of the Emperor's Children, who inducted him into the Legion.
Chaos Artefacts	Artifacts of the powers of Chaos A sentient stone capable of using its power to mutate a populace and further controlling any mutants within its influence. The Axe of Blind Fury has the furious essence of a Greater Daemon of Khorne bound within it. It rages against its eternity of servitude, resulting in both grievous damage against its victims as well as occasionally its wielder.
Swords of Epiphany	The Swords of Epiphany were a Warband, that was descended from the Exorcists Chapter. They were created, when the Cardinal Rodrigo Nessun betrayed the Plutonians and escaped from Banish with a contingent of failed Exorcists Aspirants. They had been slated to be destroyed, but after witnessing the changes Daemonic Possession wrought upon them, Nessun believed these Aspirants could move Humanity forward its next phase. Soon the Swords of Epiphany were created and Nessun baptized them as servants of Chaos. Their existence could not be tolerated by the Exorcists, however, and Captain Veyon Armadel was charged with launching the Armadel's Purge to destroy the Warband. The Captain would proceed to hound the Swords of Epiphany wherever they were sighted until at last the twisted Warband was declared destroyed.

Lufgt Huron	"The Imperium is a weak old man, ready and waiting to be broken apart by his vengeful sons."- Huron Blackheart Lugft Huron, now known as Huron Blackheart or The Blood Reaver, was the Chapter Master of the Astral Claws, a renegade Space Marine chapter which gained notoriety as the piratical Red Corsairs. He was also the ruler of the planet Badab Primaris, which he ruled with an iron fist, earning him the title Tyrant of Badab. While not a fervent follower of Chaos himself, Huron nonetheless pays homage to the Ruinous Powers as a way to further his own power.[11a]
Red Slayers	The Red Slayers were a Chaos Space Marine chapter. They were destroyed during the failed attempt to claim one of the Arks of Omen.
Wrathful Dead	The Wrathful Dead were a World Eaters warband.[1a] They wore bone helms to signify the fact that in death, their skulls were pledged only to Khorne; in order to rob their enemies of their victory, should any of the warband fall in battle. They were later part of the Butcherhorde that was led by Khârn and took part in the Black Legion's Diamor Campaign[1a]. However, like all of the Butcherhorde, they were abandoned on Amethal after the Black Legion had completed their objective and were destroyed by the Imperium's forces defending the world.[1b]
Horticulous Slimux	Horticulous Slimux is a pragmatic and humourless Daemon of Nurgle Horticulous Slimux serves as the chief gardener for the Chaos God's Garden and is known as the Grand Cultivator. While tending to the Garden, Horticulous casts an experienced eye over the festering flora all around him, while sitting astride his lumbering Molluscoid steed Mulch, which ploughs the Garden's foetid soil with the Gruntleplough pulled behind it. In battle, Horticulous' fights atop Mulch with his gardening lopping shears, while also using the host of plants, fertilisers and potions he carries, to conjure the power of the Garden of Nurgle and usher it into reality. This tactic is effective against sites of sorcerous power, as they can be overrun by the Garden's boundless Daemonic fecundity.

Vectors of Pox	The Vectors of Pox are a Chaos Space Marine warband. In M37, thirty Space Marine Chapters were sentenced to the Abyssal Crusade. The Doom Legion was among them. However, the Chapter traditionally guarded the Elusian Maze asteroid fields, and was thus allowed to retain four companies at its bases, while six were sent to take part in the crusade. The Doom Legion contingent was led by Viktarion, Captain of the Doom Legion's First Company. Like most Space Marines taking part in the Abyssal Crusade, the Doom Legion contingent was corrupted. Of its six companies, five began worshipping Nurgle, renaming themselves to Vectors of Pox. They plegded loyalty to the Death Guard and joined the Long War. The traitors subsequently returned from the Eye of Terror to reunite with their loyalist brothers. Viktarion was sent as an emissary to convince the remaining Doom Legion to join the forces of Chaos. The negotiations failed, and Viktarion was killed by the loyalists.
Ku'Gath	Ku'Gath the Plaguefather is a Great Unclean One of Nurgle. Before the Plague Wars he was 1st in the favor of Nurgle.[10c] Ku'Gath was once a Nurgling sitting upon the shoulder of Nurgle. Whilst Nurgle was mixing his most virulent toxin ever, Ku'Gath tumbled from his nesting place into the cauldron, where he took a great draught of the filthy contents and swelled with its power. Invigorated, Ku'Gath drank and drank until the cauldron was nearly empty and he had grown into a Great Unclean One. Nurgle laughed at the antics of his Nurgling, who had become the embodiment of the perfect disease that had been bubbling within the cauldron. Ku'Gath, however, realised that he had robbed his father of the greatest disease ever concocted; and has since been wandering the universe, searching for the perfect ingredients to recreate the toxin for Nurgle. He also captures those whom his diseases corrupt and take them back to his lair, where he can observe their degeneration more closely.[3a] As the Horus Heresy raged, Ku'Gath was among the Greater Daemons summoned into Realspace by the Thousand Sons, during the Battle for Terra[8a]. After the Lion's Gate Spaceport fell to the Traitors, the Daemons were unleashed to destroy the Imperial Palace's Colossi Gate[8b]. While they succeeded in tearing down the Gate's outer defenses, the Daemons were destroyed by the White Scars' Stormseers and the Adeptus Custodes, before they could complete their task.[8c]

In M42, the Warband took part in the Charadon Campaign's Invasion of Alumax and were among the Chaos forces that invaded Borthreas. There, the Shadow Flayers sent their Cults to kill the world's population within the Kunrit Blackforest, while they destroyed the towns and villages near it. However the tenacious loggers and beast trackers of the Blackforest fought the Cultists using the tools of their trade in ambushes, raids and even pitched battles. It finally took the intervention of the Shadow Flayers to end the conflict, which became known as the Flaying of the Kunrit Blackforest.
Skyrar's Dark Wolves	Skyrar's Dark Wolves, or simply the Dark Wolves, are a fearsome Chaos Space Marine warband. They are a mixed force of former Sons of Horus and Space Wolves that banded together during the Horus Heresy. The Dark Wolves emerged during the Horus Heresy as an unusual, Traitor-aligned Shattered Legions/Blackshields warband. At the time, Cadre-captain Skyrar united his Sons of Horus chapter with a contingent of Space Wolves of the 6th Great Company which had declared for Warmaster Horus. Under Skyrar's leadership, the warband was tasked with ensuring the Dark Compliance of the westernmost fringes of the Imperium just after the civil war's start. However, after the warband had massacred the entire population of Neo Cadiz as well as various other systems, Skyrar's forces effectively went rogue and became a murderous pirate force. By the late stage of the Horus Heresy, the Traitors ordered Skyrar's unit to return to join the Warmaster's main operations, but the warband ignored all messages to continue its campaign of wanton slaughter. The existence of Skyrar's mixed warband was subsequently suppressed by Imperial authorities, though rumours of traitorious Space Wolves persisted. It was even rumoured that the group represented an entire Great Company of the Space Wolves. Eventually, the Dark Wolves returned from the Galaxy's fringes and were sighted in the Fenrisian Sector. Their origins were largely a mystery by this point, resulting in the Imperium officially recording this as the "first sighting" of the warband.
Disciples of Pustulence	The Disciples of Pustulence are a Death Guard Vectorium, of the 4th Plague Company. They were among the Death Guard's forces that took part in the War for the Tri-forge Cluster. During the War, the Disciples discovered hundreds of completed Predators, that the Death Guard took possession of.
Ezekyle Abaddon	I am the Arch-fiend, the Despoiler of Worlds, and by my hands shall the false Emperor fall. Ezekyle Abaddon, more commonly known as Abaddon the Despoiler, is the Warmaster of Chaos, the former First Captain of the Sons of Horus Legion and now absolute Master of the Black Legion, and rumoured to be the clone-progeny of Warmaster Horus.[23a] He is the most powerful Warmaster of all, successor to his Primarch, and blessed by all four of the Gods of Chaos. Despite being the Warmaster of Chaos, Abaddon has refused giving himself fully over to the Ruinous Powers as the Daemon Primarchs have, as this would limit his existence beyond the Eye of Terror and push his ultimate vengeance against the Imperium beyond his grasp.[8a]
Daemonic Gift	The Gods of Chaos sometimes bless their favoured champions with a Gift of Chaos. These rewards are many and varied in design and purpose and the following are just a selection of the many which have been created. Gifts of Chaos are incredibly diverse in form and function. Some gifts are actual objects such as Daemon Weapons or suits of armour, some are physical mutations where the champion may gain daemonic features or other similar attributes, other forms of gift may reward the champion with a daemonic companion such as a Familiar or a Daemonic Steed, whilst other gifts may be even more esoteric - rewarding a champion with a daemonic name, for example. An individual bearing the Mark of Khorne is imbued with a portion of his patron's battle rage - he becomes even more ferocious in close combat and loses all sense of fear or self-restraint. Often the skull rune of Khorne is branded or otherwise etched on the bearer's flesh.
The Unclean	The Unclean are a Chaos Space Marine Warband.
Changeling	The Changeling is an infamous Horror of Tzeentch. The Changeling has the ability to assume the shape of any creature to use for trickery, to sow mistrust and confusion, and while not in battle to play practical jokes on the unwary. The Changeling has altered so many times that even he has forgotten his original appearance. Only the God Tzeentch remembers it, and keeps it secret as a means of controlling the Changeling. The Changeling's schemes are not limited to the mortal realm, and he has been known to play tricks on even Gods of Chaos themselves, such as cutting Slaanesh's hair as the Dark Prince slept or putting Nurglings on Khorne's throne, creating a mess the next time the Blood God sat down. Roaming the galaxy and Warp alike in search of committing both practical jokes and devastating mayhem, the Changeling has appeared on the battlefield as a mirror-image of a hero, his comrades unable to tell the difference between the two until it was too late. It was the Changeling who in the image of Lord Solar Macharius ordered the retreat on Goranna just as the real Warmaster was about to direct his forces to the front line. As a Grot, the Changeling sabotoged Warboss Gitsmasha's favorite Shoota, blowing the Warlord and his retinue to smithereens as soon as it was fired. On one occasion, the Changeling even took the shape of a Keeper of Secrets and answered the summoning of a traitorous Imperial Governor whose palace was besieged by Dark Angels. There, the Changeling traded the souls of the desperate man's daughters for a "powerful artifact" to turn the tide of the siege, but turned out to be a stolen Ravenwing teleporation beacon.
Angron	Angron (also known as the Red Angel and originally as Angronius of Nuceria, Lord of the Red Sand) is the Primarch of the World Eaters. He was raised on the brutal world of Nuceria, fighting as a gladiator slave and having his aggression enhanced by surgical implants known as the Butcher's Nails. The only Primarch taken into service of the Emperor against his will, he fell to Chaos during the Horus Heresy, afterwards becoming a Daemon Prince of Khorne. Savage and in a state of constant rage, he was nonetheless renowned for his battle-prowess and alongside Leman Russ and Vulkan was considered one of the most physically powerful Primarchs. The Chaos emissary to Lorgar called him the Fighter. During the Scattering, the boy that would become known as Angron was thrown to the Civilised World of Nuceria, far from Terra. He plummeted into the icy mountains of that planet, and not long after a slaver found him and a scene of carnage. Surrounding the wounded young Primarch were the corpses of numerous Xenos. Imperial scholars would later theorise that they were Eldar who had foreseen the great bloodshed that Angron would cause and had tried unsuccessfully to stop him. After being enslaved and nursed back to health by the planet's ruling masters, known as High-Riders, Angron was brought to the planet's capital, Desh'ea. Still a frightened young child, he was subsequently dumped into a pit consisting of a single ziggurat with hundreds of other slaves. Acid filled the pit, and to the cheers of the spectators Angron was eventually forced to kill all around him in order to stand upon the ziggurat's uppermost platform and survive. Shedding a tear for the last time, Angron was proclaimed a promising newcomer to Desh'ea's arena combat and given the name Angron-Thal'kr, which meant Child of the Mountain and property of House Thal'kr.[25c]
Seven Sorcerers of Harka	The Seven Sorcerers of Harka were a cabal of seven Chaos Space Marine Sorcerers. Amassing a considerable force of Cultists and Mutants, the Seven Sorcerers wreaked havoc throughout the Imperium before they were stopped by the Ultramarines. During the battle, all seven sorcerers were killed by a young Tigurius. This article needs work on its citations.For help on citation see the citation guidelines. You can help Lexicanum by fixing it.

Scargivers	The Scargivers are a Chaos Space Marine Warband.
Transcendent Spectacle	The Transcendent Spectacle are a warband of the Emperor's Children. The warriors of the Transcendent Spectacle field large numbers of Daemon Engines. The malevolent spirits of these machines are goaded to their control by the screaming murals of the warbands thralls.
The Lost and the Damned	The Lost and the Damned are the hordes of combined Chaos forces drawing from various elements united under the command of powerful Chaos Space Marines, Daemon Princes, and other great leaders who have attracted the attention of Chaos powers. Chaos Space Marines rarely make war alone, with many of their operations involving other servants of the Ruinous Powers. Influential warlords may barter with the Dark Magi of the Dark Mechanicum for possession of Daemon Engines. Others may incite hateful uprisings with cult demagogues or Dark Apostles. Others may summon Daemons or call upon the Traitor Titan Legions. Regardless, only those warlords most favoured by the Ruinous Powers can rise to unite so many factions, as by nature the servants of Chaos remain in continuous war and competition with one another for the patronage and blessings of the Gods. The forces of Chaos include a multitude of lesser hosts which form the Chaos hordes, including bestial mutants, tribes of corrupted Ogryns, warbands of Renegade Knights. The Dark Apostles especially participate in the corruption of members of the Imperial Guardsmen in order to form the renegade forces which take up the fight against the Imperium.
Masters of Magnus' Will	The Masters of Magnus' Will are a Thousand Sons Warband.
Daemonkin	Daemonkin are bands of Chaos Space Marine warriors who are devoted worshipers of the Ruinous Powers. Led by Masters of Possession, Daemonkin warbands are seen within each of the Traitor Legions and many Renegade Chapters. These formations often serve as potent bands of shock troops that can tear through the toughest of enemies. The bodies of Daemonkin are blazing crucibles into which the powers of Daemonic spirits flow. Willing hosts who believe that through sacrifice of one's flesh can true power be attained, the processes of becoming one of the Daemonkin is long and excruciating. Warbands of Daemonkin seek troves of profane lore, Warp-touched relics and sites of dark power. They learn the names of Greater Daemons that might grant them patronage, and perfect rituals of binding and sacrifice. When they are successful in summoning armies of Daemons to the battlefield, the Daemonkin act as ephemeral anchors that allow their allies to linger in realspace far longer than they might otherwise be able to do.
Threnodic Choir	The Threnodic Choir are a warband of the Emperor's Children. The warriors of the Threnodic Choir orchestrate their battles to instigate harmonies that destabilize tectonic plates.
Tainted Sons	The Tainted Sons are a Death Guard Warband. The Tainted Sons are a slow but unstoppable hammer blow, who are known as line-breakers and trench fighters without compare. Under the guidance of their Lord Gulgoth, they have earned a reputation for close-quarters brutality and display both terrifying fire discipline and an obsessiveness with efficiency that borders on madness. Indeed in battle, a favoured tactic of the Warband is to pick a single, priority target and engulf it, in a merciless destructive hail of shots before they move on to other foes. All of these attributes would serve them well when they faithfully fought for years under the Daemon Primarch Mortarion during the countless wars between the Chaos Gods in the Eye of Terror and earned them the blessing of Nurgle. This aided them greatly in battle and when the Tainted Sons were unleashed to wreak havoc outside of the Eye, the Warband discovered Nurgle's blessing still clung to them like miasma. Now the very ground they walk upon curdles into churned filth, while unnatural spores and Warp-tained fumes thicken the air around them and nothing natural can survive for long in the presence of the Tainted Sons. In fact, the very flesh of their foes begins to rot and break out in foul clusters of buboes, as the Warband closes in on them; all while the Tainted Sons gurgle out their warcry, "All will rot." The Warband fought the Ultramarines, during the Thirteenth Black Crusade and in the aftermath of the Great Rift's creation, the Tainted Sons have conquered several Imperium worlds in Nurgle's name. They have fought in the Plague Wars and earned the praise of Mortarion, when they fought beside the Daemon Primarch's side. As of now the Tainted Sons reside in the Plague Stars and continue to make war of the Realm of Ultramar[4a]. They are currently invading Korvon II and are clashing with the Ultramarines strike force that has come to save the Imperium world.[4b]

At one point, the company fell under the leadership of Kho'ren, and became known as the "Skull Takers". The company fought in the Battle of Skalathrax. Thousands of years after Skalathrax, the Skull Takers took part in the first First War for Armageddon, alongside Angron's Chosen, Lord Skchalick's Elite and The Foresworn. They were also responsible for the destruction of the Flickering Blades warband, after the Slaanesh worshipers claimed that none could best them at swordplay. Kho'ren begged to differ and led the Skull Takers in invading the Blades' slave pleasure den within the Eye of Terror. Once the battle was over, the Flickering Blades were all slain and the Chaos Lord dedicated his victory to Khorne.
Legio Kaurthos	The Legio Kaurthos is an Imperial Titan Legion. They are based on the Forge World Avachrus, which is located in the Gilead System and has since been isolated due to the Great Rift's creation. The Legio's monolithic Kauradar fortress there sits nearly empty, though, as most of Kaurthos' Titans had been dispersed to numerous battlefields before the giant Warp Storm emerged. Among these deployments, was the Legio's assistance in a confidential assignment, that Avachrus' Fabricator General, Ultima Gol Bessor, also took part in. This assignment occurred over a century ago, however, and the current status of the Legio Kaurthos' Titans or Bessor's forces is not known.
Legio Arconis	The Legio Arconis is a Titan Legion based on the Forge World Sareme. The Legio has fought for their Forge World since the Age of Strife and defended the Imperium during the Horus Heresy. Arconis' service may have come to an end, though, with the creation of the Great Rift. The giant Warp Storm caused an outbreak of Heresy to envelope Sareme and many of its Tech-Priests became Hereteks. These traitors have now nearly overwhelmed the remaining loyalists and the Forge World will soon fall to Chaos. While Legio Arconis' current fate is unknown, the Warlord Fury of Mars was destroyed in order to prevent it falling into the Hereteks' hands.
Legio Decimare	The Legio Decimare is an Imperial Titan Legion known to have been active during the Great Crusade.
Legio Crucis	The Legio Crucis are a Titan Legion of the Collegia Titanica. In 398.M41, three Titans of the Legio Crucis (1/20th of the total Legion) were attached to Battlegroup Geratomro.
Legio Dominatus	The Legio Dominatus is an Imperial Titan Legion. They were part of the Crusade fleet, led by Supreme Grand Master Azrael, that took part in the Siege of the Fenris System.
Legio Atarus	The Legio Atarus, also known as the Firebrands, are an Imperial Titan Legion. The Firebrands were often held in ill-repute by the rest of the Collegia Titanica but proved themselves during the Drop Site Massacre. The seeds of their ill-repute can be traced back to the unusual circumstances of their creation. In the early years of the Great Crusade they were pledged to the Forge World of Phaeton, the second most productive Forge World during the Crusade that was nonetheless fiercely independent. Coming into near conflict with Mars over its insistence to maintain near autonomy, Phaeton settled the conflict by agreeing to submit and give a third of its forces to the Red Planet. However the Phaeton's simply loaded this tribute onto Explorator vessels and shot them seemingly at random into the void. These ships eventually settled on Atar-Median, and the Legio Atarus became one of the younger Titan Legions to be established. But because of their ties to the old Phaeton-Mars dispute, the Firebrands were frequently distrusted by the Martian Priesthood.[2b]
Legio Ferocastrum	The Legio Ferocastrum is a Titan Legion based on Sigma-Ulstari. Their Forge World is the only Warden Planet located within the Cordon Impenetra. During the invasion of the Pankallis Sub-sector, the Legio aided in defending Sigma-Ulstari from numerous invasions from Orks and Tyranids.
Legio Castigatum	The Legio Castigatum are a Titan Legion of the Collegia Titanica. In 462.M41 the Dark Eldar Kabal of the Black Heart struck at the hive world of Lapradus, but were hurled back in disarray by the intervention of Titans from the Legio Castigatum. Mere days later, Princeps Gendath – the author of Castigatum’s victory – was murdered on his own bridge. He was hacked to shreds within his amniotic tank by hissing horrors that slithered into being amid the thrashing soup. The murky shapes disappeared as suddenly as they struck, leaving only a half-frozen mulch of blood and shattered armaglass in their wake. During the Indomitus Crusade the Legion took part in the War in the Pariah Nexus.
Legio Fulminari	The Legio Fulminari is a Titan Legion that came to the defence of the Realm of Ultramar when it was invaded by the Chaos forces of Abaddon the Despoiler during the Thirteenth Black Crusade. After the Ultramarines Primarch Roboute Guilliman was reborn, he took charge of the Imperium forces defending Ultramar and sent both the Legio and elements of the Dark Angels Chapter to liberate the invaded world Ischara.
Cyclopeans	The Cyclopeans are a Titan Legion of the Collegia Titanica, based on the Forge World Vellung. They fought the Iconoclastic Brotherhood in the War of Statues.
Legio Ferroxus	The Legio Ferroxus is an Imperial Titan Legion. The Legio was among the many Adeptus Mechanicus forces defending the Stygies VIII held-continent Megaborealis (and deploying in the Bore-Hive Scelerus) on Vigilus. During the War of Beasts, however, its Titans were destroyed in an attack by the Writhing Wyrm Genestealer Cult, which detonated a captured Vortex Missile near the still berthed Titans, destroying all of the Vigilus contingent of Legio Ferroxus in one chain reaction explosion. It is unknown, though, if Legio Ferroxus has Titans serving elsewhere.
Legio Atrox	The Legio Atrox was a loyalist legion of the Collegia Titanica during the Horus Heresy. Bound to Gulgorahd, they resisted the Night Lords in the Thramas Crusade.
Legio Aeris Aestus	The Legio Aeris Aestus is an Imperial Titan Legion.
Legio Hephaesto	The Legio Hephaesto was a Titan Legion, that served the Forge World Hephaesto.[1a] The Legio has a history going back at least 8,000 years and some of its Titans, like the Reaver Titan Telum Purgatio, took part in the Great Crusade. By M42 Legio Hephaesto numbered at 4 Titans, which were led by the 80 centuries year old Warlord Titan Lux Annihilatus, which had a storied history. Among its many accomplishments were spearheading the liberation of the Tyrem Stars from the forces of Chaos, where it destroyed the enemy Warlord Burning Hammer. It also fought the Eldar on Gavaro Secundus and aided in defeating the Tau on Jurillo. It was there, however, that the Lux Annihilatus was ambushed, by three Railgun equipped Tau Battlesuits as the Warlord and its Princep, Arlost Vass, eagerly chased after the fleeing Xenos. Though the Legio was able to destroy the Battlesuits, the Lux Annihilatus was heavily damaged and this signaled the end of Lux Annihilatus' battle group's part in the battle. This was because, through some quirk of their Machine Spirits, several Titans of Legio Hephaesto would only go to battle if they were led by the Lux Annihilatus. With the damaged Warlord being unable to, Lux Annihilatus' battle group had to be sent back to their Forge World to undergo repairs. They were then stationed within Hephaesto's Primary Forge, Node Primus, as the Lun Annihilatus was being worked upon, and were there when their Forge World was invaded by Orks. By then the Warlord had been repaired and the local Legio forces were eager to go to battle against the Orks[1a] of the Tekwaaagh! and the Freebooter Badrukk.[1b] Hephaesto's commanding Tech-Priest Dominus, Ronrul Illutar, had at first refused to deploy the Legio's local battle group, though, as he had wanted to know the Orks' total capabilities beforehand[1b]. However when the Dominus' ineptness led to Node Primus' outer walls being breached by the Xenos, he immediately deployed the Titans[1c]. Once unleashed, the Legio eagerly began easily killing the invading Ork hordes. Their appearance, though, led[1a] the Tekwaaagh!'s Mek-Boss, Da Meklord, to teleport his Mega Gargant right in front of the Legio. The massive machine was similar in size to the Imperator Titan Casus Belli and even towered above the Lux Annihilatus. The Mega Gargant's first attacks easily destroyed the Warhound Castus and forced the surviving Legio to evade its fire. Due to the Mega Gargant's size, the Titans were able to dance around its weapon fire, while whittling down the Ork machine's powerful shields. It was the commanding Princep, Arlost Vass', hope that if the Legio could wear down the Mega Gargant's shields, then the Titans had a chance to tear the Ork machine apart piece by piece[1a]. This strategy worked for awhile, until the Nob Ufthak Blackhawk sought to aid Da Meklord by attacking the Titans. Using a Shokkjump Dragsta's Shokk technology, Blackhawk and a small number of his followers were able to Warp onto one of the Lux Annihilatus' shoulders. From there, Blackhawk led an attack into the Warlord's head and the Orks slaughtered Princep Vass and his crew. With the Princep dead, the Lux Annihilatus stopped moving and this allowed the Mega Gargant to destroy the Reaver Telum Purgatio. The Ork machine then used its Lifta-Droppa to pick up the Warhound Pollaxus and throw it at the un-moving Lux Annihilatus. The impact destroyed the Pollaxus and caused the Warlord to topple to the ground[1d], where it later exploded. With the Lux Annihilatus' death,[1e] all Legio Hephaesto elements on the planet had been destroyed.[1f]
Legio Decimata	The Legio Decimata is a Titan Legion that took part in the War of the Beast and greatly aided the Imperium's forces during the third invasion of The Beast's Homeworld Ullanor.
Legio Destructor	The Legio Destructor is a loyalist Titan Legion who have been active since at least the time of the Great Crusade. The Legio Destructor (known as the "Steel Beasts") is probably the largest Legion of the Collegia Titanica, comprising over a hundred Titans of all classes.[Needs Citation] This is not surprising since Accatran, the Forge World it defends, lies on the edge of the Ork Empires of Charadon and the Wheel of Fire.[Needs Citation] Led by their eccentric Grand Master Thaedius Wilson, Legio Destructor have fought off numerous Waaagh!s and eruptions of Chaos from the Eye of Terror. It is rumored among some areas of the Adeptus Mechanicus that the constant battles against Orks have made the Legio Destructor increasingly unorthodox in its outlook and behavior, particularly in its attitude to battle and combat. The Princeps and crews of the Legio Destructor hunger for battle with an unusual exuberance. So far this thirst for battle has been viewed as a useful attribute, especially against foes other than Orks who find the Legion highly unsettling opponents. The Fabricator General himself is believed to have expressed surprise on hearing that the Titans of the Legio Destructor are now fitted with sonic amplifiers so that the Legion can reply to the Orks' howls with their own battle chant: "big death, Big Death, BIG DEATH!"[Needs Citation]
Legio Fortitudis	The Legio Fortitudis are a loyalist Titan Legion.[1a] They were part of the Imperium's forces that successfully saved the Agri World Styxia Prime, from an invasion by Hive Fleet Gorgon in late M41.[1c]
Firesword Legion	The Firesword Legion are an Imperial Titan Legion. The Fireswords assaulted the Black Fortress of Vania, during which the Titans brought down the walls of the fortress, allowing the Iron Hands into the heart of the place and ending the battle.
Legio Absolutium	The Legio Absolutium is a Titan Legion that is currently among the Imperium forces sent to retake the fallen world Agrellan from the T'au Empire.
Legio Ignis	The Legio Ignis, also known as the Fire Kings, is a Titan Legion of the Imperium. The legion fought alongside the Salamanders and Night Lords in the Compliance of Kharaatan during the Great Crusade. Ten thousand years later, the Legio Ignis fought alongside the Salamanders once again at the Cleansing of Ybrannis.
Legio Naesseas	The Legio Naesseas (also spelled as Naessias) is a Titan Legion that took part in the Horus Heresy and had close ties to the Imperial Fists Legion. They dwell on the Ocean Forge World Daxxos and are often deployed to its grimy depths, to protect the Mechanicum's monolithic Roam-Stackforges from the world's horrific sea creatures. This has led the metal on the Titans to become tarnished, but their bioluminescent white patterns still stand out and are used by the Legio to identify themselves while fighting in the abyssal darkness of Daxxos' ocean bed. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Legio Ferrax	The Legio Ferrax, also known as the Iron Wolves, are a Titan Legion of the Collegia Titanica. They are based on the Forge World of Columnus and defended it from the Weirdwaaagh!.
Legio Adamantus	The Legio Adamantus is an Imperial Titan Legion known for being stubborn to the point of suicidal tenacity. During the Great Crusade, they are known to have fought in the Compliance of Isstvan III, alongside the Titans of the Legio Victorum, Space Marines of the Raven Guard Legion and Imperial Army soldiers of the Therion Cohort. Later, in the Horus Heresy, they resisted the Night Lords to the last during the Thramas Crusade.
Legio Agravides	The Legio Agravides is a Titan Legion based on Mars during the Great Crusade. During the Death of Innocence, the Legio Agravides, along with the Legio Fortidus, was mostly destroyed when their headquarters' reactors went critical, annihilating their fortress and much of the Erebus Montes. The only survivors of the Legion were those titan crews who were deployed away from Mars during the Schism. The Legion went on to fight in the Battle of Tralsak.
Legio Amaranth	The Legio Amaranth is a Titan Legion. They took part in the Horus Heresy and were among the Imperial forces that fought in the Battle of Beta-Garmon. The forces of the traitorous Warmaster Horus were victorious in that battle, though, and Amaranth's ragged remnants were among the Imperial survivors that escaped to Terra. Horus forces were close behind, and this led the Legio's Titans to take part in the Battle for Terra.
Legio Debellator	The Legio Debellator is an Imperial Titan Legion. Due to its proximity to the Eye of Terror, the Forge World Agripinaa periodically sends military incursions into the Warp Storm to attempt to gain intelligence on and disrupt enemy musterings. The Legio Debellator is known to contribute forces to some of these excursions. The Legio's colours are very dark tourmaline red, nearly black. Their symbol is a bladed lioness icon.
Legio Gigantes	The Legio Gigantes was a loyalist Titan Legion active during the Horus Heresy. Whilst in transit through Scellis-Trevelya the warp-storms caused by the Tenebrae Pylon Array caused it to be lost, presumed destroyed.
Legio Confindo	The Legio Confindo is an Imperial Titan Legion that dwells on Byrrus Alpha and were created there before the rise of the Imperium. Their Forge World was discovered in the early years of the Great Crusade and they soon took part in the Imperium's battles, notably giving aid to the Iron Warriors, Ultramarines, and Word Bearers Legions. However, the Legio's reputation was mixed, as they became renowned for pushing their plasma reactors hard, in order to close with enemy engines and destroy them with high-powered weaponry, even at the risk of angering their Titans' Machine Spirits. These tactics earned them praise from the Word Bearers and Iron Warriors, who they formed an enduring relationship with, while the Ultramarines found their impetuosity often made them a rogue element in battle. Perhaps it was these relationships that caused a large majority of the Legio to join the traitorous Warmaster's forces during the Horus Heresy, in the aftermath of the Ruinstorm's creation which had left them separated from their Forge World. A small contingent of the Legio remained on Byrrus Alpha, however, and they began receiving fragmented messages that some of its Legio had joined the traitors and turned upon the Imperium. Believing these reports to be true, the remaining Princeps on Byrrus Alpha swore solemn oaths to bring their errant kin to justice, but before they could fulfill their pledges, they were called to fight in defense of Primarch Guilliman's Imperium Secundus. When the Ruinstorm finally ended, the contingent of Legio Confindo on Byrrus Alpha learned that their traitorous kin were in the Beta-Garmon cluster and left to confront them. What happened in that fateful battle or what happened to Legio Confindo afterwards is unknown. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Legio Ignatum	The Legio Ignatum (or "Fire Wasps") is a Titan Legion from Mars. It is one of the oldest and most honoured Legions, fighting throughout the Great Crusade, and later through the Horus Heresy, in which they defended the Imperial Palace.[1e] Two Warhound Titans of the Legio Ignatum have the honor of guarding the Eternity Gate within the Imperial Palace. The Legio Ignatum were one of the Triad Ferrum Morgulus, the three original Titan Legions that were founded during the Age of Strife. During this time, they defended smaller Forge-Fanes from the beasts that roamed Mars and gained a reputation for absolute loyalty for those they were charged to protect, differentiating them from the destruction-obsessed Legio Mortis and Legio Tempestus. Only unleashing their anger in true battle, Princeps of the Legio Mortis mistook their forbearance for weakness and sought to dominate them by force, only to be met with defiant fury. Because of the Ignatum, the Mortis failed to fully conquer Mars during the anarchy of the Age of Strife. From this name came their title Fire Wasps - named for the ancient predator of Terra which would be roused into a vicious frenzy if their nests were disturbed. With the coming of the Emperor, the Legio Ignatum became the protectors of the new Mechanicum while the Mortis became their destroyers and the Tempestus their crusaders. For most of the Great Crusade, they fought only in the defense of worlds reclaimed by the Mechanicum such as dealing with rebellions or Xenos invasions. One of their most famous battles during the Crusade was the defense of Ultrecht Magni from Orks during the Ullanor Crusade. Though the Fire Wasps were defeated by the Orks after four long days of fighting, their stubborn defense to buy time for an evacuation of the doomed world earned them much fame.
Imperial Fists (Titan Legion)	The Imperial Fists are a loyalist Titan Legion. There is no known connection between this legion and the Space Marine Legion (or Chapter) of the same name.

Legio Defensor	The Legio Defensor, also known as the Nova Guard, are a Loyalist Titan Legion. Its symbol is the stag of their homeworld Satyraes XII lit by the Forge World's twin suns. It is said that the people of Satrayes XII once worshipped the great forest stags as gods, who they saw as the forerunner manifestation of the Emperor. During the early days of the Great Crusade the Nova Guard became infatuated with the teachings of the Lectitio Divinitatus. This was due to the influence of the Word Bearers Space Marine Legion, whom they frequently Crusaded alongside in the time before their treachery against the Emperor. Of all the Titan Legions, the Nova Guard contained the largest numbers of those sworn to the early Imperial Creed. Its Princeps were known for their righteous wrath. Utterly devoted to the Emperor, they rarely gave ground to enemies and preferred to martyr themselves. However, after the destruction of Monarchia, the Legio Defensor withdrew its support from the Word Bearers openly while many of its members continued the Imperial Cult in secret. During the ensuing Horus Heresy they remained true to the Emperor, gaining a reputation for brutal righteousness and increasingly religious fanaticism. By the start of the Heresy the Legion numbered some 136 Titans, two-thirds of which were Warlords while the remainder were mostly Reavers and Nightgaunts. The use of Scout Titans was a rarity within the Legion; they only numbered some two dozen.
Legio Praetor	The Legio Praetor are an Imperial Titan Legion.
Legio Gladius	The Legio Gladius was a Titan Legion based on Diamat that fought for the Imperium during the Great Crusade. When the Horus Heresy broke out the Legion was attached to the 27th Expedition Fleet far to the galactic south on the orders of Warmaster Horus. This left their homeworld open to attack by Horus' forces.
Legio Vindictat	The Legio Vindictat is an Imperial Titan Legion.
Legio Decimator	The Legio Decimator is a Titan Legion of the Collegia Titanica. A force of Titans from the Legion took part in Imperial defenses during the Fall of Ultimatus.
Legio Lacrimae	The Legio Lacrimae was a Titan Legion. They nearly suffered devastating losses at the hands of Orks in the Rout of Megorania during the Great Crusade. However, due to the efforts of the Thousand Sons Legion, the Legio's crippled Titans were able to escape from the battle and in thanks, they gave the Legion oaths of their perpetual kinship afterwards. Sometime in the future, though, the Legio was lost in service to the Imperium. This article purports to rely on sources which are not cited in the body of the text.For help on citation see the citation guidelines. You can help Lexicanum by fixing it.
Legio Intrafex	The Legio Intrafex is a Titan Legion that took part in the War of the Beast and greatly aided the Imperium's forces during the third invasion of The Beast's homeworld, Ullanor.
Legio Victorum	The Legio Victorum are a Titan Legion. The Legio Victorum's origins are in the Age of Strife where the first Legion built Galatia a petty empire, battling both Humans and Xenos and earning the name Foe Slayers for the dead in their wake. As it conquered nearby Phall and Thule, the Legion grew in size and power. The Legio Victorum II was created from veterans around the Apocalypse Titan Apex Maxis at Phall while the Legio Victorum III was created on Thule from the most orthodox and militant Tech-Priests of the Triplex. Eventually, the Legio grew into the greatest force in the Eastern Fringe. This dominance lasted until the coming of the Great Crusade and the for the first time the Legio was humbled.[7c] The Legio Victorum II would bind its fate to that of Warmaster Horus and became composed almost wholly of Battle Titans, in particular the Warbringer-Nemesis class. It was used by Horus for the utter destruction of the foe and had a rivalry of sorts with the Legio Mortis. Horus used the Legio Victorum II's former servitude to the Legio Victorum I as a way to bind them to his cause and over time it became the most powerful element within the Legion fielding over 100 Titans. By contrast the Legio Victorum I remained on the Eastern Fringe and maintained its position on Galatia fighting as a defensive force. They became experts of fighting in urban environments without causing massive collateral damage and became known as stalwart defenders of the Imperium that was nonetheless beset by internal intrigue and plots by its Princeps and Tech-Adepts. Lastly, the Legio Victorum III was nearly forgotten and languished in obscurity upon tiny Thule. They typically saw action as dedicated raiders and reconnaissance-in-force often without any support. They only could field a few Reavers and Warlords and consisted largely of Warhounds.[7c]
Legio Vindictus	The Legio Vindictus is a Titan Legion of the Imperium. The legion is based on the Forge World of Kiavahr, and is closely allied with the Raven Guard. During the Horus Heresy, the Legio Vindictus fought alongside loyalist forces in the Battle of Ravendelve. They later walked in support of the Therion Cohort and their auxiliaries on Euesa, aiding in the pacification of the city of Milvian.

Legio Honorum	The Legio Honorum are a Titan Legion of the Collegia Titanica stationed on the Forge World of Stygies VIII, which lies perilously close to the Eye of Terror. They are known to have fought in the Thirteenth Black Crusade. Created by the initiative of Mars to further spread its power across the Galaxy, the Legion was young by the time of the Great Crusade but quickly gained the reputation of tireless crusaders. However Mars offered little direct aid to the Legio despite successive victories, and after repeated denials for new Titan engines an agreement was reached wherein they would be given rights to stewardship over a world for every 30 they lend aid in conquering. Over the Crusade they were able to gain four domains, with two more were pending by the time of the Horus Heresy. During this time, their cold Mechanicum logic had become replaced with optimism and dedication to the Imperial Truth. At this point, their strength was at 110-120 Titans that consisted of equal numbers of Warlords and Reavers with some two dozen Warhounds and an increased number of Warbringers relative to other Legions of their size. However, they lacked a Forge World to call their own and were instead a crusade Legion reliant on outside support. When the Horus Heresy began, a group of the Legio had returned to Mars to reaffirm their vows. However this was a calculated move by the traitors, who attacked the Legio Honorum in a surprise attack. During the attack on the parade grounds of Mars, the Legio Honorum lost its most cherished commanders and Titan engines. Despite this, much of their strength lay elsewhere. These survivors turned their wrath on the traitors, hunting them across the stars. Their penchant for striding forward with their faces to the enemy is represented by a Legio Trait that rewards them for doing just that. The Legio was called upon to lay siege to the traitor Forge World of Stygies VIII, which after the Heresy would become their new homeworld.
Legio Invicta	Legio Invicta is a Titan Legion principally known for its defence of the Forge World Orestes in the year 779.M41. The earliest known appearance of Legio Invicta in current records occurred in the year 412.M35, during the War of Lochrisus, when the Legio disobeyed the orders of Warmaster Gallivant. Their decision proved to be the correct one. After this, they are next known of in the middle of M41, when they were forced to eliminate Warmaster Hengis when he was judged clinically insane. Prior to the campaign on Orestes, Invicta is recorded as waging war against the Eldar in a 7-year campaign in the Beltran cluster. Though this campaign was successful, Invicta lost 8 Titans to their Eldar equivalents. Legio Invicta's most famous known action, the defence of Orestes - or Execution K494103 - took place amidst controversy; the Legio had already been ordered to deploy into the Sabbat Worlds Crusade, but chose to disobey this instruction in order to come to the aid of their Adeptus Mechanicus brethren. During the campaign (or 'walk', as it is known in the Legio parlance) a faction of the Orestes Magi attempted sedition and the Legio was forced to choose whether to enforce the will of the Orestean Magi or the world's Imperial Governor. Surprisingly, Invicta sided with the Imperial Governor and forced the Orestean Magi to stand down. Despite this complication, the walk was completed successfully.
Legio Tempestor	The Legio Tempestor, also known as the Stormlords[3a] or Storm Lords, are a Titan Legion of the Collegia Titanica.[3a]
Legio Machaera	The Legio Machaera is an Imperial Titan Legion of the Macharian Sector Forge World, Titanslair. They share it with the Questor Mechanicus Knights of House Veroth, who proudly serve as Legio Machaera's Shieldwards.
Legio Interfectra	The Legio Interfectra is a loyalist Titan Legion from the Forgeworld Satzica Secundus. The Legio Interfectra was deployed alongside skitarii forces and Ordinatii under the command of Magos Explorator Omnid Torquora to the Forge World Velchanos Magna in order to take it from the Iron Warriors, Dark Mechanicum, and Ironoclast Traitor Titan Legion forces. Deploying a force comprised of multiple Imperator-, Warlord-, Reaver-, and Warhound-class titans upon the world, they levelled the planet's hive cities and engaged the Chaos-corrupted Titans. While the battle titans engaged the enemy titans, the scout titans were deployed to the southern ruins. During the initial engagement, several Warhound-class and Reaver-class Titans were destroyed by the Ironoclast Titans.[1a] The Legio Interfectra fought against Ironoclast traitors amongst the ore-depleted peaks of the Augol Mountains.
Legio Metalica	The Legio Metalica (also known as the Iron Skulls) is a Titan Legion with a glorious legacy dating back to before the founding of the Imperium. During the Horus Heresy, at least part of the Legion turned to Chaos. The Legion's homeworld of Metalica lies in one of the most dangerous parts of the galaxy, an area infested with Orks and constantly threatened by war. The Iron Skulls were veterans of centuries of warfare even before the Great Crusade and re-unification with Terra. To date the Legio Metalica's tally of victories is unsurpassed by any other Titan Legion. In war, the Legio Metalica is noted to favour ordered tactical plans, despairing of those it fought alongside that displayed impetuous behaviour. They were unusually diplomatic in comparison to the more aloof Mechanicum, operating a contingent whose role involve integrating it with allied forces. They endlessly seek to perfect their acumen of war, which in some campaigns leads to their allies becoming frustrated by their unwillingness to share tactical developments unless deemed necessary, and even then only in cases when the commander was deemed competent enough to understand it.[14a]
Legio Nivalis	The Legio Nivalis (also known as the Ice Giants) is a Titan Legion. Based on Constanix II, they fought alongside the Raven Guard during the Battle of Constanix II during the Horus Heresy.
Legio Magna	The Legio Magna, also known as the Flaming Skulls, are a Titan Legion. They are split into loyalist and traitor factions. Founded upon the world of Estaban VII, the Flaming Skulls initially were deployed to warfronts of the Great Crusade of little note due to their parent world's isolationism and political infighting. By the middle of the 2nd century of the Crusade, they had been deployed within 21 different Expeditionary Fleets in numbers ranging from two dozen to a single Titan assigned to garrison duty. Such widespread deployment brought increasingly greater losses amongst the Legio, soon outstripping Estaban VII's ability to replace them. However in time the Mechanicum instead converted Estaban VII to supplying the Imperial Army. The Mechanicum sent out dispatches for Magna to redeploy with these new Army allies, threatening to cut off their supplies should they refuse. Within the decade over half the Legio was redeployed, now taking part in more prestigious assignments such as acting in the service of both Horus and Lorgar. Where the Legio's Princeps once cared little for honor and plaudits, they now reveled in the praise they received. During this time, their tactics changed to one favoring spearhead assaults and the use of Fusion Weapons. In time, only the Legio Krytos was renowned to more ability to bring rebel civilizations to ruin. Following the elevation of Horus to Warmaster, a demi-legio of the Flaming Skulls was deployed on Mars itself. Due to their close ties with Horus, Lorgar, and the Fabricator-General of Mars it is of little surprise they followed them into treachery in the subsequent Horus Heresy. During the Schism of Mars the portion of the Legio stationed on Mars took part in the purging of loyalists, building a reputation as butchers and fiends. Over the course of the Horus Heresy, most Traitor crews of the Legio Magna went insane.[5c]
Adamant Fury	The Adamant Fury are a Titan Legion that has fallen to the forces of Chaos. The Adamant Fury fell to Chaos some time after the Horus Heresy. In 863.M41, they were responsible for the Saint Cyllia Massacre where they turned their guns on the loyalist regiments of the world's Planetary Defense Forces before making their escape.
Imperial Eagles	The Imperial Eagles are an Imperial Titan Legion.
Legio Gryphonicus	Some text passages and/or images of this article have been removed due to insufficient Citations and placed under Quarantine on this article's Discussion page until proper citations have been provided. You can help to restore them to the article by finding the correct citations and re-integrating the quarantined text and/or images as described in the Help article on citations. The Legio Gryphonicus (aka the War Griffons) are a Titan Legion with an illustrious history. Born during the very founding of the Adeptus Mechanicus, the Legio Gryphonicus has seen action in many battles against Traitor Titan Legions since the Horus Heresy.[2b] The War Griffons possess a martial culture which often hews closer to that of a Knight House compared to an average Titan Legion. The Legion's members strive for individual skill, with which they hope to bring glory to their bloodline. This can and has led to conflict between the Legion's Princeps; this, combined with the high value the War Griffons place on discipline, has led the Legion to develop a number of internal laws allowing for duels between its members.[7c]
Legio Fortidus	The Legio Fortidus was a Titan Legion based on Mars during the Great Crusade. One of the most ancient Legions of Mars, their exact date of founding is unknown save that it was during the Age of Strife. During this time, they stood guard over Mars and were said to have been brought to extinction before being rebuilt many times over. Upon the Treaty of Olympus they took to the Great Crusade with the duty to spread Martian power across the Galaxy. To this end, the Grand Master of the Legion was given leave to claim feudal rights upon distant worlds in Mars' stead. Over the Crusade they claimed many outposts, such as those on Molech. During this time they began a tradition where once a decade the Princeps would return to Mars and tell of the Legion's triumphs and losses. During one such return to Mars, the Legio Fortidus were among the first Legion's targeted by traitors in the Schism of Mars. During the Death of Innocence the Legio Fortidus, along with the Legio Agravides, were destroyed when their reactors went critical, annihilating their fortress and much of the Erebus Montes. The Legion lost 53 of its 127 Titan engines. Surviving elements of the Legion saw themselves as the sole survivors, and became filled with rage. Seeking revenge, these small outposts would wage a bitter war against their former brothers. Due to their grievous losses, smaller Titans such as the Warhound were pushed into roles usually reserved for their larger brethren.
Legio Abominator	The Legio Abominator is a Traitor Titan Legion. They invaded the Iron Hands Chapter's Homeworld, Medusa, sometime after the Great Rift's creation. However, the Knight Houses of Tanika came to the Chapter's aid, and by working together, the Iron Hands and Knights drove Legio Abominator from Medusa's surface.
Forsaken Reavers	The Forsaken Reavers are a Traitor Titan Legion of Chaos that have long plagued the Calixis Sector and those Sectors that surround it.
Legio Maledictus	The Legio Maledictus is an Imperial Titan Legion. It is known to have battled the Night Lords and Black Legion on the Imperial world of Crythe Primus. It also took part in the defense of Pergamatros against the Black Legion during the Arks of Omen Campaign.
Legio Praesagius	The Legio Praesagius, also known as the True Messengers, was a Titan Legion of the Collegia Titanica at the time of the Horus Heresy from the Forge World of Gantz.[5b] The Legio Praesagius is one of the most ancient Titan Legions with a service record second only to the Triad Ferrum Morgulus. The Legio was originally founded on Mars as scions of the Legio Gryphonicus.[5b] They had a reputation of secular zeal and strict chivalric honor that forbade collateral damage.[6a] The legion gained great fame during the Great Crusade at Tentrion under Grand Master Bohemond, where he ensured minimal civilian losses while also emerging victorious.[6a] Other hard-fought battles followed as the True Messengers found themselves assigned to the vanguard of a number of Expedition Fleets, often fighting alongside the XVIIth and XIIIth Legiones Astartes. In many campaigns they found themselves summoned to battles others had dubbed impossible, called upon to champion the armies of the Great Crusade and to bolster flagging morale. Amidst the howling dust wastes of Akeron Cards and the towering cities of Benthur, they fought with stoic pride and utter devotion to the cause of the fledgling Imperium, and paid a high price in blood and the precious Battle Titans that were the soul of the Titan Legion to achieve victory.[3b]
Legio Praesidium Vortex	The Legio Praesidium Vortex is an Imperial Titan Legion that dwells on Agripinaa and defended the Forge World from an attack by The Despoiler's forces during the Thirteenth Black Crusade.
Legio Xerxes	The Legio Xerxes was a Titan Legion that fought for the Imperium during the Great Crusade. Their later history is currently unknown. The Legio fought as part of the 670th Imperial Expedition Fleet under the command of Princeps Amon Jeveth.[1a] Six of the Legio's Titans were destroyed by the Black Cube on Nurth due to a lack of specialist super-lifters. A week later the Legio Xerxes left the Expedition and returned to Mars, with Princeps Jeveth warning Lord Commander Teng Namatjira that he might not receive Mechanicus support in the future.[1b]
Legio Tempestus	The Legio Tempestus are a loyalist Titan Legion from Mars (later Orestes) who have served mankind since the time of the Great Crusade. A traitor branch of the Legio also exists and fought at the Siege of Terra. The Legio Tempestus was founded on Mars before the Great Crusade and is known as one of the Triad Ferrum Morgulus, or the 3 Martian Legions founded during the Age of Strife alongside the Legio Mortis and the Legio Ignatum. During this time the Legion laid claim to the Tharsis region of Mars, where they constructed rings of impregnable fortifications atop solidified lava ridges. In its earliest history the Legio is known to have clashed over territory with the Legio Mortis.[8a] The Legion gained fame in many battles alongside the forces of the Roboute Guilliman and the 12th Expeditionary Fleet. They gained the nickname of The Stormlords after the Legion's master Indias Cavalerio earned it for his skill in planetary assault during the Epsiloid Binary Cluster Wars.[1a][1b] After several bloody decades on the Crusade, the Legion needed refitting and replenishment and settled on the worlds of Estaban III and Orestes Colonia. Meanwhile Cavalerio returned to Mars with Titans that needed the most refitting. Over time, a rift began to form with the Legion elements on Mars and those in the Estaban and Orestes Systems under the control of Princeps Maximus Karania. During the civil war within the Mechanicum during the Horus Heresy the Legio rallied in support of the Magma City, governed by the loyalist Adept Koriel Zeth. Cavalerio remained true to the Imperium, but Maximus Karania revealed his treachery and became fascinated with the occult during his rule of traitorous Tempestus forces back on Estaban.
Legio Lysanda	The Legio Lysanda, known as the Sentinels of the Edge, were a loyalist Titan Legion during the Horus Heresy. Their forces fought alongside the Ultramarines in the Shadow Crusade. Formed during the Great Crusade by the Forge World of Konor, while vassals to the former they were given the forge-fortresses of Karadozit and Yandrill Prime as their domain. The Legio Lysanda were created to guard the edges of the Eastern Fringe and thus the Imperium as a whole from outside threats. They were created via the donations of Titans from a dozen Forge Worlds, primarily Konor and Gantz. Its Princeps were said to be of keen mind and cool humors, for a bellicose and vengeful nature was detrimental for their duty. They soon proved their worth despite their small size, throwing back the Yuntari Militia. They were subsequently deployed to over a dozen worlds as guardians, moving a portion of their strength ever-forward as the Great Crusade advanced the Imperium's borders further. By the start of the Horus Heresy, it numbered some 72 Titans, with few rarer models due to its young age. In their role as temporary wardens, the Legion developed a reputation for even-temperament so infamous that many claimed its Princeps could not be angered. Its members were required to undergo a period of solitude and introspection before being allowed to command their own Titan. Its Titan crews exhibited little of the hunger for glory or battle-lust prevalent in other Legions. However the Horus Heresy brought great changes to the Legion, with many of their warden worlds being reduced to cinders or turning to treachery and many of its Titans falling in battle. Often the duty of reclaiming their now-treacherous warden worlds were given to the Legio itself, traumatizing many of its Princeps. This twisted the soul of the Legio Lysanda, with its peaceful outlook warping into one of vengeance and fury.
Legio Andrastus	The Legio Andrastus is a Traitor Titan Legion.[1a] The Legio Andrastus was a Titan Legion considered twin of the Legio Astraman that turned traitor during the Horus Heresy.[1a]
Legio Ultima	Legio Ultima is an Imperial Titan Legion. Their heraldry proclaims a joint allegiance to the Adeptus Mechanicus and the Ultramarines Chapter. Legio Ultima's color scheme shows this as well, as it is based strongly on the colors worn by the Ultramarines. They fought against the Ork forces of The Beast when the Warlord invaded the Imperium. Once Ullanor was determined to be where The Beast's forces originated from, Legio Ultima joined the Imperial strike force that was sent to kill the Warlord.
Burning Stars	The Burning Stars, now known as the Suns of Damnation are a Traitor Titan Legion that betrayed the Emperor and fought on the side of the treacherous Fabricator-General Kelbor-Hal during the Schism of Mars. During that conflict, they clashed with the loyalist Titans of Legio Ignatum, though neither side was able to defeat the other. After the war they fled into the Eye of Terror and fell into worship of Tzeentch.
Legio Astorum	The Legio Astorum (also known as the Warp Runners) is a Titan Legion based on the Forgeworld Lucius in the Segmentum Obscurus. They are known to have been active since at least the Great Crusade and fought on the Loyalist side during the Horus Heresy.[14a] The Legio Astorum are the only Legio with god-machines that can be teleported straight into battle. This is a point of pride of Lucians and the matter of envy of other Legio. Where many Titan Legions are content to commit to a slow and steady advance, safe in the knowledge no foe can stand against them, the Legio Astorum sets its own tempo upon the battlefield. Through careful locomotor modification combined with extensive training amongst its Princeps, the Titans of Legio Astorum are pushed beyond all advised limits, the innate stubbornness of its Princeps seeing the protesting Machine Spirit as another challenge to overcome, albeit a challenge to be treated with all due reverence. It is upon the cusp of self-destruction that Legio Astorum thrives, its Titans granted a swiftness that few other Legios can match. In this manner has Legio Astorum earned itself a fearsome, and often mythological, status amongst both the ranks of the Great Crusade and the worlds the Titan Legion has aided in conquest.[14a]
Ordo Sinister	There are monsters, and then there are the monsters we make to fight them. Both are the same. The difference is simply a choice of how we see ourselves. The Ordo Sinister is an order of the Collegia Titanica. The Ordo Sinister's purpose is the deployment of dreaded Psi-Titans.[1b] The Ordo Sinister has a unique status within the Imperium, for it is they alone who are able to employ terrible weapons forbidden to even Primarch and Planetary Governor alike. Many of these technologies are of the Sinistrum category, those weapons designed to amplify the powers of a Psyker, often at the cost of their own life. These devices have since been installed upon Warlord Titans of the Ordo Sinister, forming psychic god-machines known as Psi-Titans.[1b]
Legio Sagitarr	The Legio Sagitarr, also known as the Deathbolts, is an Imperial Titan Legion allied to the Adeptus Mechanicus forces of Estaban.
Legio Iritans	The Legio Iritans are a Nurgle Traitor Titan Legion. The Legio Iritans were among Nurgle's forces that aided the Death Guard in the Charadon Campaign's invasion of the Tri-forge Cluster. During the invasion of the Cluster world Septios, the Titans Epidemia and Contagia Beauteous destroyed the Hydrontus-magna dam. This caused dozens of Imperial settlements for kilometres around the dam, to be wiped out by millions of tons of water.
Legio Sirius	The Legio Sirius are a Titan Legion of the Collegia Titanica based on the Forge World Lokabrenna. The Legio was part of Magos Lexell Kotov's Explorator Fleet into the Halo Scar.
Festering Death	The Festering Death are a much feared Nurgle Traitor Titan Legion, that are highly favored by the Chaos God. During the Great Crusade, they were known as the Silver Scythes and were commanded by Grand Master Marnic Bubon. When the Horus Heresy began, the Scythes were located in the rim of Imperial space and were far from the fighting that took place. However, the Titan Legion quickly succumbed to the lure of the Chaos God Nurgle and became the Festering Death. They then joined the traitorous Warmaster's forces and would win their new master's favor by spreading famine, pestilence and ancient plagues to the worlds of the Imperial rim. This favor later led Bubon to become the Daemon Prince Bubonis, but disaster struck when Warmaster Horus was killed. With his death, the Festering Death joined the Warmaster's forces that fled to the Eye of Terror. Bubonis now waits there, for the opportunity to seek his revenge against the Imperium. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Legio Osedax	The Legio Osedax (also known as the Cockatrices) are a Titan Legion of the Collegia Titanica, based on the Forge World Phaeton. The Legio Osedax fought desperately during the Age of Strife to protect their beleaguered Forge World of Phaeton. During the many wars of this time, they assaulted the Pirate and raider world of Konoral. In the subsequent battle, they destroyed an entire Hive to bury their enemies, creating their reputation for ferocity and brutal behavior in battle. They gained the name Cockatrices, creatures whose slightest glance brought death and ruin. This reputation followed them upon Phaeton's joining to the Imperium and the waging of the Great Crusade.[7a] During the Crusade, they rendered countless worlds sterile and began to resent Mars for claiming dominance over them. As their pride swelled, they sought independence from the Red Planet and a bitter dispute began that saw trade embargoes and hidden skirmishes. Only the creation of the thrall-Forge of Atar-Median, a last insult to Mars veiled in submission, prevented open war between the two worlds.[7a]
Legio Damnosus	The Legio Damnosus are a Traitor Titan Legion. They were among the first Titan Legions to side with Warmaster Horus and betray the Imperium during the Horus Heresy. This article purports to rely on sources which are not cited in the body of the text.For help on citation see the citation guidelines. You can help Lexicanum by fixing it.

Legio Covenentia	The Legio Covenentia are a Traitor Titan Legion. During the Occlusiad War, the Legion sided with the traitorous Blind King. In the ensuing battle on Pelos, the Titans of the Legio Covenentia were defeated by the Iron Hands Clan Raukaan.
Legio Mortis	Legio Mortis (AKA the Death's Heads) are a Traitor Titan Legion currently residing within the Eye of Terror. Even in the days before the Horus Heresy, the Legio Mortis were regarded with fear and suspicion. They were bound directly to the Fabricator-General of Mars, which led them to display contempt towards any Titan Legion not from the Red Planet itself. Not helping matters were their tendencies towards secrecy and hidden ritual.[5c] When the Fabricator-General allied himself with Horus, the Legio Mortis followed both into open rebellion against the Imperium[5c] and, even millennia later, they continue to one of the most infamous and feared of the active Traitor Titan Legions. The Legio Mortis was formed during the Age of Strife, before the founding of the Imperium itself. According to legends of the Martian Lexmechanics, they were one of the Triad Ferrum Morgulus, the three original Titan Legions created by the besieged Cult Mechanicum during the bloody wars to take the Red Planet from hordes of Cy-Carnivora and Mutants. Legend holds that their original purpose was to serve as the personal guardians of the Fabricator-General's domain and the annihilation of any who would threaten the cult of the Omnissiah. Before the union between the Mechanicum and the Imperium, the Legio Mortis was frequently employed as the Praetorian Guard of the Fabricator-General, punishing any who would dare challenge the authority of the Priesthood, including other Titan Legions. Their status garnered rivalry from other Legions, most notably the Legio Ignatum and Legio Venator.[1a]
Legio Metallum Armaturum	The Legio Metallum Armaturum were a Traitor Titan Legion of Chaos. During the 4th Black Crusade of Abaddon the Despoiler, the Adeptus Mechanicus enclave on the moon of Crucible was vulnerable; their Titan army was on the verge of readiness but the Araken System, which Crucible was a part of, had become cut off. The Chaos fleets were driving back the Imperial forces and it was only a matter of time before the Achilles Subsector was subsumed by the Arch-Fiend's forces. The Mechanicus on Crucible had to do something, otherwise the Despoiler's forces would seize the Titans and consecrate them to their own fell purposes. In desperation, the technomagi began to devise some way to hide Crucible from Abaddon's forces. Instead, their experimentation created the Warpstorm Araken which consumed Crucible.[1a] Millennia later, during the 13th Black Crusade, a joint Iron Hands/Adeptus Mechanicus task force journeyed to the newly rediscovered moon to retrieve the Iron Clads. In pursuit were a Word Bearers host, also in search of the Iron Clads, led by the Dark Apostle, the Iscariot.[1b] The task force made their way to the enclave, with the Word Bearers in pursuit. The Iron Father Anatolus Gdolkin led the Iron Hands and Skitarii in defense of the Titan Legion, while Magos Thule and his tech-adepts attempted to bring the Imperator Deus Mortem online. During the battle, the Word Bearers host wore down the defenders until only a few Iron Hands remained. The Iron Hands retreated to the Imperator allowing the Word Bearers to invade, bring the other Titans in the Legio online.[1c]
Legio Solaria	The Legio Solaria (also known as the Imperial Hunters) are a Loyalist Titan Legion. The Legio Solaria is an ancient Legio dating from the time of the Great Crusade and the Horus Heresy. They are known for being loud and prideful, seeing each battle as a chance for greatness and glory. They are glory seekers, often preferring to search for glory over strategic concerns. They enjoy acts of showmanship and bold tactics, though take even the slightest failure as a personal insult. As such, they are aggressive on the battlefield; wanting to hunt down and destroy the enemy and seeking out powerful foes for a worthy and glorious battle. Their personnel hold their positions via birthright, passing it down their family lines. Their officers are chosen from their planet's nobility and often look down upon those they perceive as their social inferiors. The symbol of a Legio is a winged claw, the holy symbol of Pahkmetris, the huntress goddess of Procon.[Conflicting sources]
Legio Carnivorum	Legio Carnivorum is a Traitor Titan Legion. It took part in the Battle of Malak striding through the coastal shrine-cities that lined the shores of Saint Gedawel's Sea on the planet Malakbael. The Knights of House Terryn, the Battle Sisters of the Order of Our Martyred Lady and the regiments of the Death Korps of Krieg and Ulathu Imperial Guard artillery tried to halt the heretic advance, but succeeded only in slowing its relentless march.
Legio Kopides	The Legio Kopides is a Titan Legion based on the Forge World Kernak III.[1b] The Legio had repelled an invasion[1a] of their Homeworld[1b], by the Ork Warboss Nabrot Stubfingers in the past. However Stubfingers' hordes invaded again, after the Pankallis Sub-sector was attacked by Orks and Tyranids in M42. This time[1a], despite having 32 Imperial Titans[1b] and the aid of other Imperial forces, Kernak III fell to Stubfingers' hordes. Its not known if any of Legio Kopides' Titans escaped the fall of their Homeworld.[1a]
Legio Audax	The Legio Audax (also known as the Ember Wolves) were a Traitor Titan Legion that sided with Horus during the Battle of Isstvan III.[1a] It was known for its close connection with the World Eaters, having served with them in the Great Crusade as part of the 13th Expeditionary Fleet. The legion consisted of at least 90 Warhound Scout Titans as well as Dire Wolf Heavy Scout Titans.[1b] The Legio Audax was originally founded during the Great Crusade, created upon Mars to supply new Titans to Expeditionary Fleets. To facilitate its rapid creation, its ranks consisted solely of Warhound Titans, but they were given a delegation of Tech-Priests and STC fragments for the creation of other Titan classes once they discovered a Forge World of their own to colonize. This never came to pass, for during conflict with the Zlassr Empire their STC's were corrupted by the Xenos "Voidsingers". After this event the Legio earned a brutal reputation, being officially censured after the Lorin Alpha Massacre where they indiscriminately destroyed several hives. Numerous calls to abolish the Legion were ignored by the War Council, who instead relocated it to the barren world of Bodt, the training world of the World Eaters. They were also denied any resupply requests, ensuring they would only wield Warhounds for the foreseeable future. During the Crusade their savagery and reputation saw them drawn to their World Eaters allies. This savagery soon evolved into loyalty to Angron over the distant Collegia Titanica. It was during their time with the World Eaters that the Legio developed its Ursus Claws, and the Audax came to specialize in using small swift packs of up to five Warhounds to surround larger Titans, bringing them down with these new weapons.[1b] The Ursus Claws were always on the Titan's right weapon arm, whilst the Titans within each battle-pack mounted a variety of different primary weapons on their left arms for tactical variety.
Legio Vulturus	The Legio Vulturus are a Traitor Titan Legion aligned with the Word Bearers. Originally part of the Collegia Titanica during the Great Crusade, the Legion sided with Warmaster Horus during the Horus Heresy thanks to the efforts of Erebus. During the Heresy, they wreaked terrible havoc against the Legio Gryphonicus and Legio Victorum, destroying 40 engines in one unexpected engagement. 10,000 years later, a demi-legio contingent of the Legio Vulturus appeared in the Word Bearers armada that took part in the Battle of the Boros Gate. Initially devastating the Imperial forces, the Titans of the Legio Vulturus were overwhelmed by the Necrons.
Legio Vulcanum II	The Legio Vulcanum are a Traitor Titan Legion of Chaos. The Legio Vulcanum was originally founded sometime before the Horus Heresy on the Forge World of Stygies VIII, near the Eye of Terror. Stygies VIII was rare in that it hosted two Titan Legions, Legio Vulcanum I and II, often known by their respective Low Gothic names as the Dark Fire and the Lords of Ruin. The command structures of both Legio were interlinked, and their Princeps were cloned from the twin Legio's greatest heroes. Most of both of the legions machine's were on Crusade with Horus when the Heresy began, immediately joining him. The two Legions launched an attack on Stygies VIII in cooperation with Chaos Cultists but on the verge of total victory were defeated by Eldar forces from Saim-Hann, which suddenly appeared to deny Chaos a new staging point. The two legions then accompanied the Sons of Horus into the Eye of Terror. In 444.M41, the entire Legio Vulcanum II took part in the First War for Armageddon, fighting as part of Angron's invasion force. The Legio Vulcanum later fought against Imperial forces during the Siege of Vraks. It was claimed by the Collegia Titanica that the Legio Vulcanum lost fourteen Titans during this war.
Legio Invigilata	The Legio Invigilata are a loyalist Titan Legion who fought during the Third War for Armageddon. They are based on the Forge World Voss Prime. Invigilata was deployed in Legio-strength to Armageddon to defend it against Ork invaders during the Third War for Armageddon. Elements of Invigilata were charged with roaming the Ash Wastes near the Hemlock River in support of both Cadian regiments and the Salamanders Chapter.[1a] Elsewhere, Princeps Majoris Zarha Mancion commanded one third of the total force, 19 engines, and deployed her forces to Hive Helsreach to reinforce the defences there. Helsreach's defenders initially feared that Zarha might abandon the city to link up with the rest of Invigilata but after she met directly with Merek Grimaldus, Reclusiarch of the Black Templars and leader of the Helsreach Crusade, she pledged her portion of the Legio to Helsreach's defence.[1b]
Legio Crucius	The Legio Crucius (Low Gothic: Warmongers) are a Titan Legion based on the Forge World of Ryza. The Legio Crucius are known as planners and forward thinkers, renowned even among the logical Mechanicum. Long before the Horus Heresy, they were one of the first Legions to study Titan vs. Titan combat.[6c] They are also one of the most well-equipped Titan Legions and maintain a garrison on several Forge Worlds and Adeptus Mechanicus outposts allied to Ryza, including Angstrom in the Maelstrom Zone. They have a long-standing reputation as savage city-breakers and world burners. Founded on the mighty world of Ryza, the Legio Crucius weathered the Age of Strife under a Cult Mechanicus sect known as the Omnissiah Igvita or "Life Blood of the Omnissiah". This orientated Ryza towards the belief that plasma was the lifeblood of the Omnissiah, and through its usage the people of Ryza were given a measure of his power. As such, over time the Legio Crucius came to wield large amounts of plasma technology. Due to some tension between Ryza and Mars before the Horus Heresy over issues of the former's growing power and hoarding of plasma technology, the Legio Crucius was strengthened in preparation for conflict. This proved to be fortuitous due to the outbreak of the Heresy.[7a]
Legio Kydianos	The Legio Kydianos, known as the Death Cry, are a Traitor Titan Legion. The Legio was one of the two Titan Legions founded on Xana after it joined the Imperium during the Great Crusade. However unlike the more campaign-orientated Legio Vulturum, the Legio Kydianos instead was recalled to defend Xana. They followed their masters into siding with Horus during the Horus Heresy.
Legio Morbus	The Legio Morbus is a Traitor Titan Legion that has fallen to Nurgle and was among the Chaos God's forces that invaded the Forge World Metalica during the 13th Black Crusade.
Legio Excruciatus	The Legio Excruciatus are a Traitor Titan Legion of the Dark Mechanicus. They fell to Chaos some time after the Horus Heresy. In late M41 they would aid the Daemon Prince Kor Megron in the Battle of Eagle Gate, deploying Chaos Warhound Titans in the assault. In the battle they lost the Blasphemous Rex, the first Titan loss of any kind since their fall to Chaos. The Legion also took part in fighting at the side of the Crimson Slaughter and Black Legion in the Diamor Campaign.
Legio Argentum	The Legio Argentum, known as the Dread Lances, is a Traitor Titan Legion of Chaos. During the Horus Heresy, they would work closely with the Iron Warriors. Betraying the Imperium at the onset of the Horus Heresy, the Legion fought in the Great Siege of Lesser Damantyne against Iron Warrior Loyalists in one of the earlier campaigns of the Horus Heresy where they suffered heavy losses. In 008.M31 Legio Argentum also fought alongside Legio Mortis and Legio Vulturum against Loyalist forces on the planet Maerdan.
Legio Mordaxis	The Legio Mordaxis is a traitor Titan Legion. Haling from a Forge World cloaked in toxic atmosphere, the Deathdealers weathered the Age of Strife in sealed manufactoria upon Micarlan, emerging to eradicate all who trespassed on their domain.[2b] Micarlan's toxicity had been unleashed by unknown Xenos drawn into conflict long ago, and upon defeating these creatures the Mordaxis came to battle a nearby Ork empire. They undertook many attempts to colonize worlds outside Mordaxis, all meeting failure at the hands of Greenskins and other Xenos. It was only with the coming of the Great Crusade that Micarlan was freed from war, instead eagerly joining the Imperium and embarking on the Crusade.[3a] The Legion became one of little note or repute, lacking the wealth and patronage of greater Titan Legions. Throughout this time they became closely associated with the Word Bearers. This partnership proved to be their eventual corruption, for in the time before the Horus Heresy they were slowly corrupted by Lorgar. During the Heresy itself they declared for the traitors and infected their engines with techno-toxins. Their Princeps exist in a world of constant torment, linked into their engines ravaged by disease. This forges them into lumbering behemoths immune to pain.[2b][3a]
Legio Vulpa	The Legio Vulpa, also known as the Death Stalkers, are a Traitor Titan Legion.[1b] The Legio Vulpa was founded upon Anvillus during the Age of Strife in order to combat the Jindarii, a race of nomadic bio-mechanical hunters which fielded machines similar to Titans. The first Princeps of the House proved adept in felling the xenos' temple-cities. The final battle of the war saw the Legio conquer the forge-moon of Yythe, located in the third closest star system to Anvillus. During the war it is said the Grand Matriarch of the Hyzebaru Tribe of the Jindarii, who stood 43 meters tall, slew seven Titans before being slain in turn. After the battle a 2km long line of Jindarii skulls were left along the Moon's greatest river, each one engraved with the stanza "Here our greatest blades rest, firm in belief they knew death’s art, taught instead by those who stalk beneath its shroud". From that day forth, the Legio Vulpa bore the name of Death Stalkers with pride. The effect of the war saw the Legio mimic their Jindarii foes, adopting the same cunning, adaptability, and emphasis on stealth and speed over ranged weaponry. These tactics were compiled in the Libraxus Tacticae Vulpa. In the centuries that followed the Legio proved instrumental in expanding Anvillus' domain.
Legio Phasma	The Legio Phasma are a Traitor Titan Legion. They were long sworn to the Night Lords during the Great Crusade and sided with them in the Horus Heresy.
Legio Interfector	The Legio Interfector, also known as the Murder Lords, are a Traitor Titan Legion of Chaos based in the Eye of Terror. During the Great Crusade the young Forge World of Valeous II was chosen as the homeworld for the newly founded Legio Interfector. The original Titans of the Legion consisted of a shipment of unconsecrated engines sent from Lucius to Graia. Upon being deployed from the Crusade with the intent of supporting the Ultramarines in Ultima Segmentum, 3/4ths of the Legio was instead cast adrift in the Warp and found itself instead in a warzone between the Luna Wolves and an Abominable Intelligence known as the Chroxius Myriad. The arrival of the Legio quickly turned the course of the war and the Interfector forged strong ties with Warmaster Horus as a result, who bestowed the Legion the title the "Lords of Valour". For the remainder of the Crusade the Legio fought under the banner of Horus, who became an idol to its Princeps. Thus it is little surprise that the Legio sided with Horus during his rebellion against the Emperor. However it is said a madness of unknown origin had infected the minds of its Princeps, twisting and subverting them solely to worship of Horus. After taking part in the Battle of Isstvan III for three days the Legion departed, scattering across the stars. Elements of its forces moved on Valeous II, successfully spreading their madness to the Tech-Priests of the world and its forges dedicated solely to the service of Horus. From that day forward the Lords of Valour were no more, instead replaced with insanity. They moved from world to world, obliterating all in the name of Horus. By this point its Titans were broadcasting the gibbering prayers of its crews, interspersed with peas for blood and whispers in unknown tongues. Soon enough the Legion earned a new moniker - the Murder Lords. During the subsequent Heresy, the Legion is also known to have taken part in the Battle of Molech and the Siege of Terra.
Legio Mortis Metallum	The Legio Mortis Metallum is a Titan Legion. During the 13th Black Crusade, the Legio defended the hive Godspire Secundus during a Death Guard-led invasion of the forge world Fornax Orbis Majoris.[1a][1b]
Legio Pestis	Legio Pestis is a Traitor Titan Legion that has fallen to Nurgle and was among the Chaos God's forces that invaded the Realm of Ultramar during the Plague Wars.
Legio Saevus	The Legio Saevus was a loyal legion of the Collegia Titanica during the Horus Heresy. Bound to Gulgorahd, they resisted the Night Lords in the Thramas Crusade.
Legio Xestobiax	The Legio Xestobiax, known as the Iron Vigil, is a Titan Legion. The origins of the Legio were with the Titans that accompanied the original Human colonizers to Zhao-Arkkad. The Titans protected the colonizers from the many beasts of the world, and they would continue to protect Zhao-Arkkad for many years to come.[1a] During the Great Crusade the Legio Xestobiax established close ties to the Thousand Sons Legion, frequently fighting alongside them. Nonetheless, the Legio remained one of the smallest and least prominent Titan Legions of the Crusade. The bulk of its small strength fell to Reaver and Warlord classes. However, due to its ties to Zhao-Arkkad and the Thousand Sons, it was said that the Legio Xestobiax may have dabbled in Psi-Titan technology. The only known development from this was the creation of psycho-reactive iron cores in their Titans, technology gathered from fallen Eldar war machines. This technology allowed the experience of fallen Titan crew members to channel into the current pilots. As a by-product of this research the Titans and crews of the Legio began to act increasingly bizarre and prone to hallucinations.[1a]
Legio Scarifactor	Legio Scarifactor is a Traitor Titan Legion. It took part in the Battle of Malak striding through the coastal shrine-cities that lined the shores of Saint Gedawel's Sea on the planet Malakbael. The Knights of House Terryn, the Battle Sisters of the Order of Our Martyred Lady and the regiments of the Death Korps of Krieg and Ulathu Imperial Guard artillery tried to halt the heretic advance, but succeeded only in slowing its relentless march.
Legio Damicium	The Legio Damicium is a Traitor Titan Legion, that took part in the Horus Heresy. The Legio hailed from the world of Urdesh, which faced a slow extinction during the Age of Strife thanks to the loss of their STCs and raids by Pirates and Xenos. During this time they maintained only a single Warlord Titan, the millennia-old Somnium Ultimus. Upon assimilation into the Imperium the Legio numbered only 30 Titans, and they were aided in their rebuilding efforts by the Fabricator-General of Mars Kelbor-Hal in exchange for fealty. Despite ample aid from Mars and the Legio Mortis, tensions simmered underneath the surface as these allies refused to give Urdesh the ability to produce its own Titans. This desire to become self-sufficient drove them into the arms of Warmaster Horus, who facilitated the shipment of Titan-manufacturing technology and increased aid to Urdesh in the years leading up to the Horus Heresy. Horus also gave the Forge World many lucrative contracts to produce rare Leman Russ variants for the Imperial Army. Their true allegiance to Horus was not revealed until the Cataclysm of Iron, though in truth they took part in many hidden cells loyal to the Warmaster before openly declaring for him.
Legio Rorgahl	Legio Rorgahl is a Traitor Titan Legion. Some of its Princeps have pledged their service to the Iron Warriors Warsmith Czagra and are among his forces taking part in Abaddon the Despoiler's Ark of Omen Campaign

Legio Inardescus	The Legio Inardescus is a Tzeentch Traitor Titan Legion. They are currently taking part in The Upsilon-Kapha Severance, during the Prosperan Rift War.
Riotous Host	The Riotous Host is a Traitor Titan Legion that has fallen to Slaanesh; its Titans are now equipped with Sonic Weaponry. During the 13th Black Crusade, they joined the Emperor's Children in invading the Imperium world Extremis Six and, under the orders of Lucius the Eternal, used their Sonic weapons to cause the world's numerous starscrapers to collapse. In the aftermath of the destruction, three Astra Militarum Regiments arrived to enact vengeance for the billions lost in the invasion, but they were easily defeated by the Riotous Host and Emperor's Children.
Legio Venator	The Legio Venator (Iron Spiders) is an Imperial Titan Legion based on the M'khand or Opus Macharius.[4a][Conflicting sources]. It was originally based on the world of Arachnus. During the Age of Strife the Legio stood guard over Arachnus, defending it against the native arachnid mega-fauna and attention of raiders. These battles were costly, with some 100 Titans being lost over 600 years of fighting. After Arachnus made contact with the Imperium's Great Crusade and refused to bow to Terra, the Legio Venator resisted. They fought the Legio Astraman and Legio Laniaskara over a dozen worlds for 5 years before the conflict concluded with Arachnus' surrender. Despite the previous conflict, over the Great Crusade their forces gained a sense of pride in brotherhood and unity, a belief at odds with those left behind on Arachnus. During the Cataclysm of Iron the Legion split between the 2/3rds of loyalists waging the Great Crusade and the remaining 1/3rd on Arachnus that pledged themselves to the Dark Mechanicum, becoming known as the Legio Tritonis. After this, the loyalist Legio Venator used their secondary forge-fortress of M'Khand as their primary fortress. When Arachnus was reclaimed at the end of the Heresy M'Khand remained their home due to the devastation and corruption wrought upon Arachnus.
Legio Oberon	The Legio Oberon is a Titan Legion based on the Forge World of Anvari. The Legio Oberon was created during the Great Crusade on the recently founded Forge World of Anvari as an attempt by its thrall-master Accatran to secure their power in the realm of Ultramar. It was created via donations of a fragment of Titans from the Legio Destructor. In honor of this agreement, both swore to protect the other. In accordance with Accatran's desire to forge relations with the Ultramarines, the Legio Oberon was often given to the forces of Roboute Guilliman during the remainder of the Crusade. Their time with the Ultramarines ultimately proved to temper their previously warlike nature while also enhancing the tactical abilities of its Princeps. The naming of the Legio Oberon proved contentious when Mars learned of its existence over a decade after its founding, for the title of Death Bolts already had been given to the Legio Honorum. Following much contemplation, it was agreed the Legio Oberon would take the title of Death Bolts II, while the Legio Honorum became known as Death Bolts I.
Legio Proditor	Legio Proditor is a Traitor Titan Legion that has fallen to Tzeentch and was among the Chaos God's forces that successfully invaded the Stygius Sector during the 13th Black Crusade.
Legio Ulricon	The Legio Ulricon[Note 1] is a Traitor Titan Legion. Historically close to the Night Lords during the Great Crusade, the Titan Legion joined them in rebellion against the Emperor in the Horus Heresy. During the Thramas Crusade, the Dark Angels destroyed the Legion's flagship in an ambush over the planet Sheol, causing many of their Titan engines to spill into space. Despite this catastrophic loss, the Legion continued to operate until at least the late Heresy.[3a]
Legio Laniaskara	The Legio Laniaskara is a Traitor Titan Legion that took part in the Horus Heresy. Wardens of Valia-Maximal, it was originally tasked with eradicating the giant beasts of their home. They battled not only these creatures, but also invading Human-Xenos Empire dubbed the Hydrinoxis Conclave. These centuries-long conflicts were often fought beneath undersea caves, leading the Impalers to favour direct and brutal tactics. Following the end of the Hydrinoxis Xenocides and the victory of Valia-Maximal, the Legio Laniaskara led an aggressive campaign of expansion outside of its own star system. They eventually came into contact with the Imperium, briefly battling the 114th Expeditionary Fleet and its Raven Guard and Legio Astraman contingents. However, in the end the Imperials achieved victory, and Valia-Marximal began its vicious grudge against the Legio Astraman and its Forge World of Graia.[3a] The Legion's merciless reputation grew during the Great Crusade and they became known to tear through enemy fortifications with close-ranged weaponry and bullish charges. During the Horus Heresy they sided with the traitors, likely due to their hatred of Graia, and engaged loyalists in the Cataclysm of Iron.[3b]
Legio Perennia	The Legio Perennia is an Imperial Titan Legion based on the Forge World of Bronta-Median. Founded a few decades before the Horus Heresy, the Legio Perennia's home Forge World of Bronta-Median was close to the seat of Imperial Power in Segmentum Solar. During the Heresy Bronta-Median's ruling Magos Gaius Trasq declared for the loyalist Mechanicum under Kane over Kelbor-Hal's Dark Mechanicum, and the Legio Perennia mobilized for war. The Legion was to be deployed on Terra and defend the world from Horus's onslaught, but while in transit aboard the transport vessel Omnissiax, Alpha Legion infiltrators attempted to seize the ship. The Alpha Legion, bringing about traitor Princeps, took control of several Perennia Titans within the Omnissiax's hanger bay, opening fire. The ship was devastated from within, allowing traitor Legionaries to take command of the vessel. The Omnissiax and its traitor-controlled Titans were then dispatched to Callistra Mundi under the orders of Armillus Dynat.
Protectorate of Unsubdued Steel	The Protectorate of Unsubdued Steel was a Blackshield Legio, active during the Horus Heresy. It was created during the Cataclysm of Iron and was composed of Imperial Titans from several Legions, including Legio Astorum and Legio Damnatus. As the Loyalists and Traitors waged war on each other within the Belt of Iron, the Protectorate of Unsubdued Steel began building an empire of its own. Among the first worlds to fall to the Blackshield Legio was the Forge World Arl'yeth after it refused to peacefully join the Protectorate's empire. The conquered Forge World then joined a dozen other worlds that the Blackshields controlled at that time.
Fire Masters	The Fire Masters, known originally as the Legio Suturvora are a Traitor Titan Legion that defected to the forces of Horus during the Horus Heresy. By the end of the Great Crusade and Horus Heresy, they were also known as the Legio Infernus.[3c] One of the earliest Martian Titan Legions, it was created as a second generation to the Triad Ferrum Morgulus in the so-called "Era of Pathogenesis". Their earliest actions saw them secure Mars for the Mechanicum from the remaining hordes of the cabalistic Cy-Carnivora Mekwrights and their gargantuan hunger-engines. To this end the Legion was modeled after the Legio Ignatum and given a forge-fane in the southern region of the Sea of Iron Curses known as Mons Sutura. For the ensuing centuries the Legio kept a southern watch on Mars against ancient threats stirred by exploring Magoss, an unceremonious and overlooked role. Deprived of significant patronage, they became dependent on the Fabricator-General for its supply and writ of service. Its isolation drew and it developed a culture of stoic, military-religious zealotry, and hardened traditionalism dedicated to the Fabricator-General. After the Mechanicum union with the Imperium they left Mars as part of the Great Crusade, fighting alongside the 1st Expeditionary Fleet led by the Emperor himself. They became known as the Masters of Fire during this time for their scorched earth tactics and tendency to reduce cities to rubble in their fervor. When Fabricator-General Kelbor-Hal joined the forces of Horus, the Legion enthusiastically joined their master due to their fervent belief in the Cult Mechanicus.
Legio Incurvos	The Legio Incurvos is a Tzeentchian Traitor Titan Legion. They are currently taking part in the The Upsilon-Kapha Severance, during the Prosperan Rift War.
The Horus Heresy Book Five - Tempest	The Horus Heresy Book Five - Tempest is the fifth book in the Horus Heresy series by Forge World. It covers the Battle of Calth. Previously isolated from the brutal devastation of the Horus Heresy as it tore across the Imperium, the Ultramarines were drawn into Mankind’s civil war when betrayal reached Ultramar. The Horus Heresy Book Five - Tempest tells of the Word Bearers’ treacherous attack on the Ultramarines at the mustering world of Calth. This cataclysmic battle engulfed the entire system, pitching not only the Legions against each other, but also the massed ranks of the Imperial Army militia and the towering god-machines of the Legio Titanicus. Lavishly illustrated in full colour, this leather bound 270 page book contains an extensive history of the Ultramarines, unit profiles and an army list as well as rules for the Primarch of the XIIIth Legion, Roboute Guilliman, so he can lead your army to war along with the elite of his Legion. To represent their part in the conflict, the rules for the Word Bearers Legion have been updated and new units and characters provided for them. The new Imperialis Militia & Cults army list allows you to field the massed troops and war machines of a range of armies raised on a myriad of worlds, including planetary defence forces and twisted Warp cults, with rules to represent your army’s unique background and fighting style.
Legio Vulturum	The Legio Vulturum, known as the Gore Crows, are a Traitor Titan Legion. Originally sworn to Xana, they defected to the forces of Horus during the Horus Heresy. Little is known of them beyond their merciless nature, and that their Titans are often outfitted with experimental technology. Founded upon Xana during the Great Crusade, the Titans of the Legio Vulturum nonetheless included many ancient engines dating back to the Age of Strife. Like its patron world, its history is mysterious and contradictory, and many within the Mechanicum became baffled as to how such a well-supplied and powerful Forge World could exist in such a distant party of the Galaxy. Xana initially resisted assimilation to the Imperium, but as war was about to erupt the Rangdan Xenocides erupted. Faced with the vicious Rangdan, ties between Xana and the Imperium were quickly cemented and the Forge World became host to two separate Legions: the Legio Vulturum and the Legio Kydianos. Of the two, the Legio Vulturum became the more active during the Great Crusade. Like Xana, it gained a dark and sinister reputation and became known for its merciless tactics. Upon the battlefield, its Princeps exerted a measure of independence often bordering on insubordination and often formed their own force, committing to battlefields judged worthy of their might. The Legion took part in the brutal Rangdan Xenocides and their experiences in the campaign did much to turn the Gore Crows into a force of merciless killers that reveled in unleashing their might upon those they deemed weak. Its Titan became the basis for many Xana's experimental weapons, including esoteric beam devices, explosive munitions that tore through fortifications, and Void Shields capable of turn aside entire bombardments only to fail in response to the briefest broadside.

The Serpent Beneath (Novella)	The Serpent Beneath is a novella by Rob Sanders published in the Horus Heresy anthology The Primarchs. When your entire existence is based around deceit, who can you trust? That's the question that plagues Omegon, one of the twin primarchs of the Alpha Legion, as he prepares a team of elite operatives for the most difficult and dangerous mission any of the Alpha Legion have ever attempted to infiltrate a secret installation controlled by the Alpha Legion itself! Omegon, one of the twin primarchs of the Alpha Legion, questions Legion Librarian Ursinus Echion on the status of a high-security Alpha Legion base named Tenebrae Station[2b] that is able to manipulate the Warp through a pylon array and that the Alpha Legion have used to keep the White Scars contained and ignorant on Chondax[2e]. After ending their conversation Omegon turns to Sheed Ranko, hidden from Echion's sight in the shadows, who helps him form a plan to neutralise a security leak by destroying the base.[2b]
Lords of Valour	The Lords of Valour was a small Blackshield Legio of Reaver and Dire Wolf Class Titans, that was formed during the Horus Heresy. Its existence was unconfirmed by the Imperium, however, rumors claimed the Lords of Valour were possibly Loyalists, who had somehow escaped Legio Interfector's corruption into Heresy. They were also rumored to have operated within the Systems surrounding Legio Interfector's Forge World, Valeous II.
Storm Lords (Titan Legion)	The Storm Lords are a Traitor Titan Legion that sided with Horus during the Horus Heresy and took part in the Battle of Terra.
Legio Fureans	The Legio Fureans, or Tiger Eyes[5a], are a Traitor Titan Legion who fell to Chaos during the Horus Heresy.[5a] The symbol of the Legio is a baleful eye which originally symbolized the Omnissiah's favour and wrath. After their treachery, the eye would become associated with the Eye of Horus.[6a] Originally based on the Forge World of Incaladion, it was subject to constant wars and invasions before it was liberated by the forces of the Great Crusade. Founded by the a Mechanicum Sleeper-Ark during the Age of Strife, the same stable Warp-currents that had succeeded in carrying the Mechanicum to the world were, as time progressed, to bring a host of dark voyagers. As a result, the Incaladion Mechanicum, separated by vast distance from Mars, evolved into a distinctive and highly warlike faction. Waves of xenos invasion spurred unusual avenues of technological development and the creation of vast fortified cities. Throughout this long and savage history, the Legio Fureans formed the principal military force of Incaladion's ruling Archmagos.[2b] Their more common name the "Tiger Eyes" also stemmed from this early period as a corruption of the name given to them by the feral tribes of the nearby world of Humardu, to whom the Titans truly were divine and terrible beings. Unlike some garrisoning Titan Legions before the Great Crusade, the Legio Fureans did not stand vigil as enforcers for petty empires of the Machine God's servants, but rather fought an unceasing war against a host of foes. For centuries the Legio Fureans unleashed their wrath against invading hordes of Ork marauders and the spiteful raids of Yldari corsairs, scavenging Tarellian war-packs and the colossal viscid horrors of meteor-brought Carnoplasm infestations from the Abyssal Reefs.[2b]
Legio Tritonis	The Legio Tritonis is an Imperial Titan Legion, that became the first Blackshield Legio during the Horus Heresy and refused to fight for either the Imperium or Warmaster Horus. The Legio was formed from Legio Venator on Arachnus during the Cataclysm of Iron and was named after the three celestial bodies of Arachnus (the planet itself and its two moons). Desiring independence, after purging their homeworld of any who sided with the Imperium, the Dark Tide embarked on a ruthless campaign across the Belt of Iron against loyalist and traitor alike.[4a] At the end of the conflict Arachnus was invaded by Venator loyalists, supported by the Legio Atarus.[4a] The Legio Tritonis surrendered to the Imperium and pleaded for mercy. According to records, all of the rebels of Arachnus were annihilated, but reports exist of Titans in Tritonis livery active on planets across the Belt of Iron.[4a]

Magos Calliope Vartothex lives still, and leads a ragged band of injured and desperate followers, united by a single desire: to survive. In the ravaged desert wastes outside Forge Avarna, they find salvation – a deactivated Titan of the Iron Kings. If they can bring it under their control, Calliope and her comrades may still achieve victory. Yet Fury of Mars has its own machine-soul, and may not be so easily swayed...
Adeptus Titanicus (Game)	The Adeptus Titanicus game was released in December 1988.} One player controlled some Imperial Titans whilst the other controlled some Chaos Titans, re-enacting battles from the Horus Heresy. It was the first game to introduce the idea of Epic (6mm) scale gaming. Adeptus Titanicus is set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, around M30 during the Horus Heresy. During this time, thousands of battles were fought between armies of Titans and war machines across the galaxy. The tremendous firepower available with a Titan makes it a deadly weapon, able to kill hundreds in a single salvo. You are given control as the commander, or princeps, of the Titan legions of the Adeptus Titanicus. Whether you follow the Traitors or Loyalists is up to you, but to succeed you will need fast thinking and good planning, or you shall suffer only death on the battlefield. Eldars were present as part of the Horus Heresy setting, usually taking side with the Loyalists, as they were fighting against Chaos rather than with the Imperium [3c]
Legio Bombastor	The Legio Bombastor is an Imperial Titan Legion. Several of the Legio's vaunted Titan maniples defended the Fortress World Shen'tzi Vo, until a mighty warband composed of the Iron Warriors and Death Guard invaded it. Despite their efforts to defend the Fortress World, all of Legio Bombastor's Titans were destroyed by the Iron Warriors.
Legio Serpentes	The Legio Serpentes are a Titan Legion that has fallen to the forces of Chaos. They once safeguarded the Forge World Uraniborg 1572, until it came under assault from the techno-heretic Votheer Tark.

Legio Krytos	The Legio Krytos are a Traitor Titan Legion. Before their discovery by the Imperium, the Legio Krytos took part in a brutal war against the ruthless slave-empire known as the Agrenium Convocation, which besieged their own Forge World of Krytos. The war wrought great change upon the psyche of the Legio, who came to specialize in Siege Titans such as the Warlord and Warbringer Nemesis. It took over a century of war for the Legio to subdue the Agrenium Convocation until they annihilated their homeworld of Planet-269A, also known as Agreniux. Shortly thereafter, Legio's homeworld of Krytos was discovered by the 125th Expeditionary Fleet under Perturabo, who quickly signed a pact of friendship with them. Known as brutal and taciturn killers, throughout the later Great Crusade the Krytos distinguished itself for their policy of razing entire planets. The God breakers specialized in heavy assault missions, utilizing a mixture of devastating ranged weaponry. Perhaps as a result, they worked closely alongside the Iron Warriors. They fielded many Warbringer Nemesis Titans as well as 3 Imperator Titans, one of which was always stationed upon their homeworld of Krytos.
Legio Abhorrax	Legio Abhorrax is a Traitor Titan Legion who aided the Iron Warriors in their battle against the Death Guard on Dysactis during the 13th Black Crusade. They also later took part in the Nachmund Rift War.
Pretermitted Brotherhood	The Pretermitted Brotherhood was a Blackshield Legio, active during the Horus Heresy. As the Heresy raged, the Legio watched over the burned-out remains of their Homeworld and struck down all who dared sully its memory by walking upon it.
Legio Damnatus	The Legio Damnatus was a Traitor Titan Legion that sided with Warmaster Horus, during the Horus Heresy. As the conflict's Cataclysm of Iron raged, however, several of Damnatus' Titans joined the Protectorate of Unsubdued Steel. This Blackshield Legio had no loyalty to either the Imperium or Warmaster Horus and went on to build its own empire. The remaining Titans of Legio Damnatus would later go on to take part in the Heresy's Battle of Terra. As the Legio descended in their ship to take part in the invasion of Terra, though, it was fired upon by a defensive laser manned by Imperial Loyalists. The laser struck Damnatus' ship and it was completely destroyed, taking the entire Legio with it.
Cleansing Flame (Blackshield Legio)	The Cleansing Flame was a Blackshield Legio, active during the Horus Heresy. As the Heresy raged, the Legio conquered worlds that had been recent battlegrounds between the Traitors and Loyalists.
Legio Fortis	The Legio Fortis is a Titan Legion and was part of the Imperium forces that defended the Realm of Ultramar during the Plague Wars.
Legio Pallidus Mor	The Legio Pallidus Mor (also known as the Pale Riders) is a loyalist Titan Legion from the forgeworld Tolkhan. The Pallidus Mor is an ancient Legio, dating back from at least the time of the Horus Heresy. They are known for being grim and solemn, knowing that sacrifice and loss is inevitable in war, and also that victory is not a glory, but a duty. Even victories are not to be celebrated, but studied and learned from in preparation for the next battle. They also keep themselves as physically fit as can be, in the event (however unlikely) that they are forced to fight an enemy outside of their Titans. They are known to choose personnel based on ability, as opposed to birthright, readily taking officers even from lower-born classes. During the Horus Heresy, in the Battle of Cruciatus Primus, the Pallidus Mor faced off against traitorous members of the Iron Skulls. The Iron Skulls believed the fatalistic demenour of the Pallidus Mor made them susceptible to corruption. The Pallidus Mor did not fall to the corrupting influence, however, and repelled the Iron Skulls. While all records of the traitorous members of the Iron Skulls were officially striken from Imperial Archives, the Pallidus Mor never forgot the event, nor the insult that they were even considered corruptible.
Legio Annihilator	The Legio Annihilator are a Titan Legion that stayed loyal to the Imperium during the Horus Heresy and also took part in the First War of Armageddon. In 995.M41, the Legion would find itself defending the world of Megyre from Hive Fleet Jormungandr. Initially successful against swarms of advancing Termagaunts and Carnifexes, the Princeps of the Legio Annihilator had little chance to enjoy their victory. A new threat emerged, a gigantic Tyranid resembling a Trygon, but far larger. Similar in size to a Reaver Titan, its fangs dripped with acidic venom. Without effort the enormous Bio-Titan ripped a Warlord Titan to pieces and tore a ruinous path through the remaining war engines of the Legio Annihilator, using its superior maneuverability over the slower Imperial Titans to its advantage. Faced with this daunting foe, the Legio was unable to defend the world and the fate of Megyre was sealed. The status of the Legio since the battle is unknown.
Legio Manus Flameaus	The Legio Manus Flameaus is a loyalist Titan Legion. They took part in the Jarix V Campaign, where they led the Imperium's attack against the forces of the Eldar.

They aided in the attack on Espandor, which nearly fell to Nurgle's forces, until Lord Commander Roboute Guilliman arrived and counter-attacked with a large Imperial strike force. As battle raged anew across Espandor's surface, the Legio Onerus's Titans were destroyed by Guilliman's forces at the Spires of Priandor. It's not known whether the entirety of the Legio was destroyed in the battle.
Legio Kulisaetai	The Legio Kulisaetai is a Titan Legion, that took part in the Horus Heresy on the traitor side. The Legio was founded on the embattled world of Kalibrax before the coming of the Great Crusade. A broken force due to its many civil wars waged during the Age of Strife, the coming of the Imperium saw it receive much aid from Kelbor-Hal and the Legio Mortis. The foundations of the Legio Kulisaetai were from pro-Imperial factions in Kalibrax's civil war that battled a genocidal faction known as the "Endeavour of Airless Purity" which sought to eradicate life on a galactic scale. After aiding the Legio Mortis in eradicating this threat, the Legio Kulisaetai was rebuilt with Tech-Priests and Titans sent from Mars itself, earning the title as the Gatekeepers of the Fabricator-General on Kalibrax. They then took part in the conquest of the Belt of Iron alongside these new allies. However in truth the Legio Kulisaetai were not a truly independent force and were instead heavily dependent on the Legio Mortis, with many of its Princeps and Tech-Priests being former members of the aforementioned themselves. During the Great Crusade the Legio brought their style of methodical destruction to dozens of worlds across the galaxy. In war, they were famed for scorched earths tactics. They had relatively few Warhounds as they preferred attritional warfare, while their Warlord Titans usually sported defensive loadouts. Their preferred type of Titan was the Warbringer-Nemesis.
Legio Astraman	The Legio Astraman (also known as the Legio Astramana or the Morning Stars) are a loyalist Titan Legion. Founded during the Age of Strife to protect Graia, the Morning Stars are known for their tenacity and for fighting against impossible odds; they could be counted on to stand fast in the face of any danger. Their success was due to the extensive network of industrial expansion that was capable of producing large numbers of Titans, tenacity and firm resolve, and the orbital platforms around Graia which supplemented its capacity for defence. Upon Graia's entry into the Imperium and the participation of the Legio Astraman the Great Crusade, they formed a close bond with the Raven Guard. Over the course of the Crusade, they gained much experience and skill in fighting dissident Titan Legions such as the Legio Venator and Legio Laniaskara. By the time of the Horus Heresy, the Legio Astraman fielded some 156 Titans, including at least three Imperators. The remaining Titans were evenly split between Scout and Battle types. During the Heresy, they were viewed as a major threat to Horus' efforts and fought viciously to protect Graia in the Cataclysm of Iron.[4c] Later on, the Legio would contribute 18 titans to defend the loyalist-held Cthonia alongside the Imperial Fists during the Siege of Cthonia.[6a]
Blackshield Legio	Blackshield Legios were Titan Legions that refused to serve the Imperium or Warmaster Horus, during the Horus Heresy. They did so for various reasons, which for some included a desire to carve out an empire of their own.
Legio Ordo Canis	The Legio Ordo Canis is an Imperial Titan Legion.
Legio Thanataris	The Legio Thanataris are an Imperial Titan Legion. The Legio took part in the Horus Heresy. A maniple of the Legio was present on the world of Tekeli when the World Eaters Legion commanded by Daemon Primarch Angron invaded the world. The battle went on for eight days until the last of the Titans was destroyed. The Legio also took part in the Damocles Crusade, with their Titans facing significant resistance from Tau Manta Gunships. Later, the Titans of the Legio Thanataris were instrumental in Operation Hydra.
Collegia Titanica	The Collegia Titanica is the section of the Adeptus Mechanicus that includes the Imperial Titans, the colossal god-machines. The Collegia is also known as the "Adeptus Titanicus" (a contraction of "Adeptus Mechanicus Collegia Titanica") The Collegia Titanica was formed before the Age of the Imperium, during the Age of Strife. It is thought that the first Titans were created during a terrible war on Mars against a debased caste of cabalistic heretics dubbed the Cy-Carnivora. Vast swathes of the Red Planet had fallen to the Cy-Carnivora Mekwrights, and it took the creation of Three Titan Orders to annihilate them. After defeating the Cy-Carnivora and other horrors of Old Night from the Red Planet, the Titan Legions became guardians of various Forges. It was during this time that they grew and took on their own unique characteristics and traits. After the Treaty of Olympus, the mighty war machines of the Collegia Titanica joined the Legio Astartes and Imperial Army in the Great Crusade to conquer much of the Galaxy. As this new Imperium expanded, the Adeptus Mechanicus took many worlds for themselves. These planets were settled and converted into Forge Worlds, and became the bases of new Titan Legions.
Legio Pyria	The Legio Pyria is a Traitor Titan Legion. The Legio Pyria fought on Mars against the forces of Legio Ignatum during the Martian Civil War at the start of the Horus Heresy, but was ultimately humbled by the superior legion.
Legio Castigatra	The Legio Castigatra is a Titan Legion of the Collegia Titanica. During the Horus Heresy the Legio Castigatra remained loyal to the Imperium and was nearly destroyed by the traitorous Legio Audax during the Battle of Absolom.
Daemon World	A daemon world (or daemon-world) is a planet twisted and corrupted by the power of Chaos and the warp from being trapped in a prolonged warp rift. Entwining the impossibilities of the warp and the reality of the physical realm, Daemon Worlds are not bound by the laws of physics, but by the whim of daemonic rulers and the emotions of mortals. The power of Daemons and Daemon Princes is greater in the Eye of Terror and other places like the Eye of Terror than it would be anywhere else in the galaxy. Daemon Worlds are usually ruled by a Daemon Prince, who can shape the world to his liking. Each of these worlds is a bizarre sub-reality ruled by terrible Daemon Princes. The four Chaos Gods continuously compete to possess the Daemon Worlds. Armies of daemons and their living allies fight huge and bloody battles to determine which of the Chaos Powers will possess them. These battles often last for hundreds of years, so that the entire world becomes little more than a gigantic arena where the opposing forces are pitched against each other. The Chaos Powers do not, of course, appear in person to lead their armies - they are spectators to events, not participants. Their generals are Greater Daemons and favoured Daemon Princes who, because they were once alive, understand the nature of both the material universe and the immaterial warp. Once a Daemon Prince has conquered a world, his grateful patron gives it to him as a gift to rule over as he wishes.[Needs Citation] When a Daemon Prince takes control of his hard-won world, he uses his mighty powers to reshape it to a form that pleases him. Because of this, every world is different and all are equally spectacular in their own way.[Needs Citation]
Titan	Titans are immense war machines built in humanoid form. Most of the major races and forces of the galaxy utilize their own forms of Titans. Imperial Titans are known as God-Engines and are controlled by the Collegia Titanica, a powerful military arm of the Adeptus Mechanicus. The Collegia oversees the various Titan Legion's, each of which are based on a Forge World. Titans originally began as Human technology to allow settlers on new worlds to function in hostile environments, but today the god-engines are the most powerful fighting machines of the forces of the Emperor. The construction of Imperial Titans takes many years, and many of the more complex designs are considered lost technology.[5a] The forces of Chaos utilize Titans largely derived from those of the Imperium. These are operated by the Traitor Titan Legions and maintained by the Dark Mechanicus. Many of these Titan engines have become corrupted over the years by the powers of the Warp and are now furious engines of hate possessed by Daemons, their pilot little more than a slave to the machine. Chaos Titans are heavily mutated, often sprouting tails or techno-organic appendages.[5d]
Banelord Titan	The Banelord Chaos Titan is a huge war machine - the Khornate counterpart to the Imperial Warlord Battle Titan - armored with a carapace of semi-organic shaped armour.[1a] Banelords were among the Traitor Titan Legions which took part in the Horus Heresy against the Imperium. With the defeat of the rebellion, the Titan Legions that followed Horus were driven into the Eye of Terror, which has become their exile and safe haven.[1a] Over the thousands of years spent in the Eye of Terror, the Banelords have been altered to such an extent that it is no longer clear whether the Banelords are corrupted Warlord Titans or creations from the hellish forges of Chaos themselves. The Banelords have taken on the appearance and colors associated with Khorne, the Titans' heads have been reshaped into daemonic visages, and flags, kill banners and pennants fly with the symbols of the Blood God. No one absolutely for sure knows whether the Chaos Titans are still piloted by their original crew, their lives made eternal within the Eye of Terror, or by something far worse,[1a] though some claims that the crew are long dead and now melded with weapons of their Banelord.
Reviler Titan	The Reviler Titan was a unique pattern of Imperial Titan used by the Legio Fureans during the Great Crusade and Horus Heresy. The Legio Fureans was known to favour the use of an idiosyncratic light-intermediate sub-pattern developed locally on Incaladion known as the Reviler. This pattern was designed to operate principally as a mobile Inferno cannon platform and replaced the use of the heavier Knight classes in the Legion's core of retainers.
Fabricator-General	The Fabricator-General, also known as the Magos Mechanicus, is the highest ranking position of the Adeptus Mechanicus. A Fabricator-General oversees his respective Forge World along with his deputy, the Fabricator-Locum. While many Forge Worlds have their own Fabricator-General, it is the Fabricator-General of the Mechanicum homeworld of Mars that is the most powerful and prestigious. In addition to overseeing the general Mechanicum, the Fabricator-General of Mars is the head of the Cult Mechanicus and speaker of the Martian Parliament. The Fabricator-General of Mars is most often chosen from the Forge Master of the Olympus Mons Forge. As the leading figure of one of the Imperium's most powerful and influential organizations, he is invariably a member of the High Lords of Terra.
Renegades	Renegades (subtitled Eldar and Chaos Armies for Space Marine) is an extension for the second edition of Space Marine. Produced in 1992, it contains rules and background for Eldar and Chaos armies. It didn't contain any miniatures.
Warmaster Titan	The Warmaster Heavy Battle Titan is among the largest classes of Imperial Battle Titans. Secret records attest to the Warmaster Titan being in use millennia before the advent of the Imperium of Man, for instance in the wars against the Cy-Carnivora.[5d] Its existence was a closely guarded secret by the Mechanicum until the late Horus Heresy[2a], with even the highest echelons of the Cult Mechanicus not openly speaking of it.[2b] They were covertly seeded on certain Forge Worlds, kept slumbering and shrouded until a day its home planets very existence was at stake. On that day the Warmaster would stride out, annihilating all in its wake.[5a] The first open use of Warmaster Titans came during the Heresy in the Schism of Mars[2c], when word spread of the forge-fanes of Phoenicis falling in a day to a wrathful god-engine, or of entire maniples destroyed by a single, towering giant of battle.[5a] In the opening phases of the battle the traitorous Legio Mortis revealed its hidden stock of Warmaster Titans, causing devastation to loyalist forces. The Legio Mortis had acquired a number of Warmasters due to its alliance with Kelbor-Hal, the treacherous Fabricator-General of Mars. However the Legio Mortis victory was so complete that word of the new Titan would not reach loyalist forces until the Siege of Terra.[2c]
Warmaster	Warmaster, also known as Lord Solar, or just Solar[Conflicting Sources] is a special military rank of the Imperium and the Imperial Guard. Historically, Warmaster was the title bestowed upon the most favoured Primarch, Horus of the Luna Wolves Space Marine Legion, by the Emperor. The granting of this title was to recognise that Horus was to act as the Emperor's proxy during the latter part of the Great Crusade. Eventually, the Luna Wolves were renamed the Sons of Horus to better reflect the prestige of the Warmaster's title. Now, it stands as the one of the most powerful ranks in the Imperial Guard, second only to the rank of Lord Commander Militant of the Imperial Guard. Warmasters are created when a Crusade is being planned and resources from multiple sectors are needed. Supreme overall command is necessary as internal strife and corruption might make assembling the material required and co-operating in the field difficult for members of the same rank. The rank is not available unless granted by the High Lords of Terra and such an individual is said to be given the powers by the Emperor himself. There is rarely more than one Warmaster operating within the Imperium at any one time, due to the extreme powers given to them.[Needs Citation]
Kelbor-Hal	Kelbor-Hal was the Fabricator-General of the Mechanicum during the Great Crusade and Horus Heresy. He joined forces with Horus and assisted the renegades with all of the technology available to mankind, forming the Dark Mechanicum. Kelbor-Hal was present when the Emperor first arrived on Mars, and, while the Master of Mankind was widely celebrated by most of his colleagues, he was deeply distrustful of the Terran warlord. Hal and his followers were among those who refused to see the Emperor as the avatar of the Omnissiah, instead only seeing a False prophet who had subordinated the Mechanicum under the Imperium's heel with lies and falsehoods. Kelbor-Hal feared that the Emperor and His forces were going to strip away the autonomy Mars had enjoyed dating back all the way to the Dark Age of Technology. Despite this disdain, eventually Kelbor-Hal was able to rise through the Tech-Priest hierarchy to become Fabricator-General by the late Great Crusade. He gathered around him a circle of like-minded Magi including Urtzi Malevolus, Lukas Chrom, and Melgator.
Questor (Scout Titan)	The Questor Scout Titan is a Slaaneshi Daemon Engine and small class of Titan. Slightly larger than a Subjugator and with thicker armour, its powerful legs can still drive it forward at considerable pace. Graceful arms spread from the Questor's carapace, each tipped with a rapid-firing Tormentor Cannon. It also bears a pair of Lascannons, one on the front of its carapace, and one underslung.
Chaos Warlord Titan	The Chaos Warlord Titan are Imperial Warlord Titans corrupted by the powers of Chaos which now serve in the Traitor Titan Legions.[1b] These Titans wield weaponry similar to those of their Imperial cousins such as the Volcano Cannon, Quake Cannon, Plasma Destructor, Macro Gatling Blaster, Laser Blaster, and Vortex Missile.. However they also have unique armaments such as the Doomburner (similar to the Volcano Cannon), Havoc Rack, and Doomfist. They are also are known to spawn battle claws, weapon-tipped tails, and tentacles known as Chaos Energy Whips.[1b] The first known appearance of Chaos-corrupted Warlord Titans was during the Battle of Beta-Garmon, when the Word Bearers and Dark Mechanicum infected several Legio Vulpa Warlords. The unfortunate Princeps of these engines were permanently fused to their machines and corrupted by Daemons.
Feral Scout Titan	The Chaos Warhound Titan (sometimes referred to as a Feral Titan) is the Chaos counterpart to the Imperial Warhound Scout Titan operated by Traitor Titan Legions. The Chaos Warhound Titan Machine Spirit is wholly corrupted by the powers of Chaos and the Titan's soul and crew, now possessed by daemons, are doomed to serve the Chaos Gods in battle for all eternity. They are formidably armed with two 'Titan weapon' mount hard-points available, with the same weapons available as the Imperial version:
Plaguelord Titan	Plaguelord-Class Titans* are Titans that have been fully corrupted by the power of the Chaos God Nurgle and now give off deadly diseases.
Emperor Titan	The Emperor Titan is the largest type of Imperial Titan, consisting of at least three classes: the Imperator, the Warmonger and the Nemesis. Emperor Titans are immense, mobile fortresses, mounting veritable arsenals of weaponry, protected by void shield generators and armour so thick an Emperor Titan would not be out of place on a planetary defence installation. Emperor Titans are among the largest mobile battle units that can be deployed on a planet's surface. It forms a vital role, employed against the most formidable and overtly powerful enemies, providing massive, destructive and directed power. Emperor Titans employ the same technologies as other Titans but on a massive scale, relying on huge plasma reactors to supply their colossal requirements. The most noteworthy feature of an Emperor is the fortified castle-like structure which occupies the entire upper half, sporting ornate features like spired towers and stained glass viewing portals. The building is heavily-armed, and more than capable of contributing to combat.[7a] Due to its prominent position, the Titan's head is situated lower than normal on the body, almost at the same level as the arm weaponry.
Epic	Epic is the collective term for a series of tabletop wargames produced by Games Workshop, set in the Warhammer 40,000 and Horus Heresy universes. Gameplay is centred around large-scale battles involving hundreds of soldiers and dozens of tanks, and as such, employs comparatively small 6mm scale miniatures (often referred to as Epic-scale). Since its initial release in 1988 as Adeptus Titanicus, the series has gone through a number of incarnations with varying names. Epic battles consist of hundreds of soldiers and dozens of tanks arrayed across a long battlefield. To make this possible the scale of Epic miniatures is around 6mm, compared to the 28mm for Warhammer 40,000. As the game is based on 6mm scale, the physical size of armies is much smaller. This reduces the cost of purchasing forces dramatically compared to other games. It also allows much larger vehicles and creatures to be fielded, including Titans and Bio-Titans, as well as using many aircraft at once. Aeronautica Imperialis concentrates heavily on aircraft at the same 6mm as Epic, allowing physical interchanging of models between the game systems.
Chaos Lord	Chaos Lords are the leaders of many Chaos Space Marine forces. Chaos Lords are not necessarily those who rose through the ranks properly in a hierarchical fashion, but are often those most blessed by the Chaos Gods or simply the most powerful or charismatic. The greatest Chaos Champions become Chaos Lords and are often granted with mutations and alterations by the gods to further their cause. Chaos Lords are so powerful as to be able to bind the forces of Chaos to their will, although this often brings a dangerous position as advancement is commonly achieved through killing their leader. Some Lords lead through brute strength, others through cunning and some are maniacs bent on self-aggrandizement. Others are truly worshipers of Chaos with a zealous dedication to the dark gods. Champions often come with a mark of one of the four Chaos Gods. Champions of Khorne are savage and value physical strength and combat over cunning and strategy. Tzeentchian champions are often very knowledgeable and many of them are sorcerers. Champions of Nurgle are the most distorted and physically corrupted of Chaos' followers, their bodies dulled from pain enabling them to endure physical injury with little trauma. Slaaneshi champions are often those who seek the most intense pleasures possible and are often physically the fastest Chaos warriors due to their hyper-sensitive minds.
Chaos Reaver Titan	The Chaos Reaver Titan, also known as Ravager Titans, are Reaver Battle Titans operated by the Traitor Titan Legions. Nearly all of the Chaos Reavers in service are left over from Titan Legions of the Dark Mechanicum which sided with Warmaster Horus during the Horus Heresy and are thus increasingly rare. As is the case with most Chaos Titans, its Machine Spirit is wholly corrupted by the powers of Chaos and the Titan's soul and crew, now possessed by daemons, are doomed to serve the Chaos Gods in battle for all eternity.[1a] A medium-class Titan, Chaos Reavers are armed with heavier weapons then their Feral Scout Titan counterparts but are still not as heavily armed as a Warlord or Emperor Titan. They may carry up to two primary weapons and one secondary weapon.[1c]
Warbringer Nemesis Titan	The Warbringer Nemesis Titan is a large class of Imperial Titan. The Warbringer is between the size of a Warlord Titan and Reaver Titan. It is a dedicated Titan hunter and dedicated fire support platform, sporting a truly immense quake cannon designed to take down enemy Titans at range. The Titans reinforced frontal plating allows it to weather most return fire with casual ease, and its defense batteries render it well-protected against aerial attacks, though its relatively light rear armor can leave it vulnerable to flanking attacks by ground armour. Used during the Great Crusade against various Titan-scale xenos constructs, the Warbringer came into its own during the Horus Heresy, as Titan war became commonplace. This class of Titan is renowned for its bellicose Machine Spirit, and it is said that the Titan may lock onto targets and assume firing positions before their crews are even aware of an approaching threat. The main weapon of the Warbringer is its carapace mounted Quake Cannon, which is capable of transforming anything it hits into a white-hot crater. This artillery weapon features a revolver-style loading mechanism and is crewed by a spotter and a loader. The Warbringer can also mount a Mars-Alpha Pattern Nemesis Volcano Cannon as its main carapace weapon. Besides this, the Warbringer is equipped with two carapace-mounted Anvilus Defense Batteries, three Ardex-defensor Mauler Bolt Cannon turrets, and two arm-mounted weapons which can be a Laser Blaster, Gatling Blaster, Volcano Cannon, or Melta Cannon.
Slaanesh Subjugator	The Slaanesh Subjugator is a Daemon Engine and small Titan of Slaanesh. This giant walker is incredibly swift, able to move quickly and still use its weapons. This construct is armed with both sonic weapons, so typical of the Emperor's Children, and with the sinister, psychically-powered Tormentor Cannons, that unleash the energy within the walker to kill the victims with unbearable agony, leaving their bodies charred by the twisted energies. As hard as it is to believe, it is even more skilled in close combat; it is equipped with two Hellslicer Battle Claws, killing everyone daring to face this torture device. And yet, it is not unstoppable. While the awesome power of its weapons might pin entire squads down, those brave enough to face it will find that its armour is no better than that of a Dreadnought, ending the pleasure of daemons far quicker than they would have wanted.
Imperial Palace	The Imperial Palace is a vast edifice that serves as both the palace of the Emperor of Mankind and the capital city of the Imperium of Man. Built across a large part of the Asian continent on Terra, the Palace is divided into the Inner and Outer Palaces. The Palace is built to truly monumental proportions: seen from orbit, it consists of connected kilometres-high monolithic and pyramidal structures, marked with landing pads and studded with defense weaponry. The palace itself is the seat of the Adeptus Terra, but is overseen by the Adeptus Custodes. Not only is the area of the Imperial Palace enormous, its macro-habs and space ports break through the atmosphere and rise into the void, and its sub-levels dig deep into Terra's holy bedrock, in some places reaching a depth of hundreds of miles below the surface. Its vaults, corridors, fastnesses, plazas, and chambers are so multitudinous that no single record remains to list them all, and the techno-urbanic serf tribes, clan holdings, and societal sub-nations that dwell within its walls could populate entire star systems.[19b] Construction of the Imperial Palace began after the Unification Wars as a symbol of the Emperor's might and a monument dedicated to mankind's new unification. Based around the Himalayan Mountains, the Palace was designed by the most expert artisans of the many Masonic Guilds of Terra. The early management of the Palace was left to the Seneschals of the Departmento Regia Interior. Construction of the Palace defenses was overseen by Primarch Rogal Dorn, much to the frustration of Perturabo. Some construction of the Palace was still taking place by the end of the Great Crusade, meaning construction took at least 200 years.

Citadel Journal 13	Issue 13 of The Citadel Journal was published in 1996. The magazine contains background articles, modelling advice and rules for: ...
Black Crusade	A Black Crusade is an incursion that is formed when the usually disparate forces of Chaos unite under a particularly strong Chaos Champion and go forth en masse to wage war against the Imperium of Man. Following the devastating events of the Horus Heresy, the Imperium began the Great Scouring, a campaign to cast out all traitors who had sided with Chaos and drove them into the warp storm known as the Eye of Terror. There, the followers of Chaos began to fight among each other for domination and territory and their vast armies eventually fractured. Even so, the threat the exiles posed was far from gone. To this day they seek to overthrow the Imperium, launching separate raids and invasions against it. Once or twice within a millennium however, an exceptional Chaos Champion rises who is strong enough to bring his fellow warlords and their hosts under his sway. When this happens ancient rivalries are set aside and uneasy alliances are forged, clearing the way for what is called a Black Crusade.

Known Vessels of the Emperor's Children	The following is a list of known spacecraft belonging to the Emperor's Children.
Battle tank	Battle tanks are heavily armed and armoured vehicles generally designed to fight both infantry and vehicles. Imperial battle tanks are constructed on Forge Worlds, and most use designs that are thousands of years old. Other races have their own methods of construction. A notable race are the Orks, who construct their tanks out of the wreckage of other races' war machines. Battle tanks are normally used to supplement infantry actions, using their heavy weapons to wipe out troops and engage other vehicles. Sometimes battle tanks will be used alone, such as in environmental conditions that an infantryman couldn't survive.
Known Members of the Alpha Legion	The following is a list of known members of the Alpha Legion. It should be noted that members of the Alpha Legion are commonly known to give their name as simply 'Alpharius' when asked, no matter what their actual name may be or the implausibility of 'Alpharius' as a response. The list below contains only those Legionnaires that have been identified under another name. Heresy
Crusade	A Crusade is the Imperial term given for a very large-scale military campaign undertaken by Imperial forces in order to conquer several worlds in one offensive. Crusades are usually broad enough in scope to involve several worlds and many smaller-scale campaigns. They also often involve more than one branch of the Imperial military, in which case they are led by a Warmaster or an officer of sufficient rank to command multiple arms of the Imperial military.[Needs Citation] Only the High Lords of Terra were able to declare a Crusade that could be any campaign from being a long, large-scale war involving many Space Marine Chapters or could be a short conflict that is resolved in a single battle with only a handful of troops. Crusades is one means of drawing contingents from several Space Marine Chapters and binding them together to fight an enemy. This serves as a way of not committing entire Chapters or involving the ponderous resources of the Imperial Guard. They can be declared against heretic Lords or even rebellious planetary governments that had turned against the Imperium due to their own selfish reasons. Crusades are also able to be launched against alien planets or newly discovered worlds that lay beyond the Emperor's light. To Chapters of the Adeptus Astartes, the contribution of Space Marine forces is a matter of honour and can see a squad or two of troops deployed when they are called upon to take part in a Crusade. Once won, the Chapter will add the battle honour to their standards as a mark of achievement and loyalty. Entire Space Marine Chapters can take part in a Crusade as an act of penance for failure or due to incurring the displeasure of the Emperor. Such acts are very extreme but are nonetheless willingly taken as completion means the Chapter earns the forgiveness of the Emperor thus allowing the Space Marines to return to their homeworld and be absolved of heresy.

List of sentient species	This is a list of sapient species known to exist (or have existed) within the galaxy and beyond. The title is due to widespread confusion about the definition of "sentient", which is able to perceive or feel (almost all life is sentient, because it must be able to perceive in order to operate its metabolism, which is part of the definition of life), as opposed to "sapient", which literally means wise but figuratively is commonly used to mean "self-aware". Note that the use of 'species' is much broader than the dictionary definition. In this article, the 'species' distinction includes lesser definitions, such as sub-species. Unless otherwise noted, any species listed below may have the necessary additional mutation to be a psyker or blank. Likewise, any may be perpetual, although there are no known blank perpetuals.

However, due to the varied time frames, there are two things to consider: 1. Heresy-Era Astartes without the 'Deceased' tag, are presumed, unless otherwise explicitly stated (Such as in the case of Captain Gravius), to have died sometime prior to M41. Many of the Astartes listed in this period fought at Isstvan V and in the confusion of that battle and its aftermath, their ultimate fate is unknown.

He was killed at the battle for the Shrinehold when his tank was hit by an incendiary shell. His officers Captain Sirus and Lieutenant Pauk were also killed in the same action, leaving only Captains LeGuin and Woll in positions of authority within the detachment. Their regiment is featured in Double Eagle, the spinoff book to Gaunt's Ghosts.

Chapter Approved	Chapter Approved was a regular column in White Dwarf in which officially approved background and rules information created by the Warhammer 40,000 design team - often the head designer directly - were published. It also included looks 'behind the scenes' at the design process, as well as trial rules and FAQs. These articles were collected into annual-style compilation books several times, also called Chapter Approved and subtitled as the 'Books of the Astronomicon'. Originating in the first edition of WH40K, it resurfaced during Third Edition, and the tenure of Andy Chambers as the system's head designer (or the Warhammer 40,000 Overfiend, as the position was also then known). Readers of White Dwarf were invited to write in to him with requests for material to be featured; be it rule clarifications, unit discrepancies, a focus on certain background, or even suggest the creation of certain rules and units. These requests were met upon several occasions, with articles stating they were created in response to reader request. Other articles were created to act as player aids or designer soapboxes. The column ceased appearing in the transition to Fourth Edition, only to intermittently resurface some time later, without the 'frontperson' of the departed Andy Chambers.

Each is supported by Ironkin Wayfinders who have the ability to navigate the Warp much in the way of Imperial Navigators.[1a] When navigating the Imperium, Kin vessels utilize electromagnetic scoops to power hydrogen ramjets that - while not the swiftest means of propulsion - are arranged in such clever profusion as to render Kin ships balletic, despite their huge size.[1a] Some weaponry utilized by Leagues vessels include Conversion Beam batteries and Drill Torpedos while they commonly utilized Weavefield Projectors for protection.[1b]

List of Battles of the Ultramarines	For ten thousand years, the Ultramarines have battled the enemies of the Emperor of Mankind whenever they threaten the Imperium of Man. Despite being pledged to the Great Crusade for around a century, the Emperor had never once rebuked Lorgar or his Legion for their zealous worship even though such doctrine clashed with the Emperor's Imperial Truth. However 43 years prior to the events of Isstvan V the Emperor brought his wrath to bear on the Word Bearers. The Emperor ordered the Ultramarines to utterly destroy the city of Monarchia, a perfect city that was testament to all that Lorgar and the Word Bearers stood for. In the ashes of the city the entire Word Bearers legion gathered to be reprimanded by the Emperor, Roboute Guilliman and Malcador the Sigilite. The Legion in its entirety was forced to kneel in the ashes of their greatest achievement and repledge themselves to the Great Crusade and to the Emperor. Towards the end of the Great Crusade Horus led his own Sons of Horus, Angron and his World Eaters and a great number of Ultramarines against the world of Arrigata. The Ultramarines were the shining beacons of light that the Astartes were meant to be, quickly and efficiently destroying any resistance and the contrast of the feral World Eaters. With a single citadel left to conquer Horus commanded Angron to take it and kill only the leaders. By the time the Ultramarines arrived they were able to access the defeated fortress by a ramp of corpses, mostly World Eaters as testament to the unthinking fearlessness of Angrons warriors. In vengeance of their fallen brethren the Ultramarines found the dismembered and mangled bodies of the defenders. Not a single soul was left.

List of Alaitoc Aeldari	List of Aeldari originating from Craftworld Alaitoc.

When written, Calibanite is printed in neat, rounded script,[3b] which is difficult to translate into High Gothic. Low Gothic
Explorator Binary	Explorator Binary is very similar to Techna-Lingua, the binary language of the Explorator fleets has diverged from its parent tongue; the Mechanicus permits its use, but frowns on it for official discourse. Questors and other field operatives use it to keep conversations private from their planet-bound brethren.
Hrud Lexicon	The Hrud Language is hardly known, spoken of primarily by former captives and trade partners. Most of the language and it's terms are shrouded in mystery. The Hrud form archives for their records, which are stored at least in part on the inside of crystal prisms. 0-9 A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z Top of page — See also — External links
Hexad	Hexad is a hexadecimally based language used by the Adeptus Mechanicus. It is the most sacred and consecrated machine-code of the Mechanicus. The language is used for spiritual lore and the holiest scriptures of the Cult Mechanicus. While hexad is easy to read for both people and machines it is composed in a number of divine configurations. To understand it, one must know which configuration the hexad is written in. This is how Mechanicus encrypts its deepest gospels.
Thoughtmark	Thoughtmark is an advanced form of sign language used for communication by the Sisters of Silence. Combining gestures and body language, sisters can use Thoughtmark to communicate anything from simple battle orders to intricate concepts pertaining to the nature of witchcraft. The speech can be rendered audible by technological systems that allow sign forms to be machine-readable at great speed , or even output them as vox signals if needed . Alternatively, they are translated by the Proloquors - acolytes of the order yet to take their vows. Some outsiders learn to translate or use Thoughtmark themselves, most notably the Adeptus Custodes. Thoughmark is a language that is much easier to translate than to wield, for its subtle and nuanced movements are difficult to master.
Ur-tongue	Ur-tongue is the language of Old Earth and is the ancestor to any number of languages currently used by Humans. However very few now know how to read or speak Ur-tongue.
Tergiza	Tergiza is a dialect of Medusan, used by the Space Marines of the Iron Hands' Clan Raukaan. Little emotion is conveyed by this language, which is notable for its exceptionally rigid grammar and vocabulary by human standards.
Skit-code	Skit-code is one of the many dialects of Cant Mechanicus and regularly used by skitarii. It is a dialect designed to efficiently express tactical data and is entirely unequipped to express anything more. Blurts of skit-code are transmitted over vox with a brief and rapid pulse of clicks.[1a] Longer orders given in skit-code through vox transmissions can sound like a buzz.[1b]
Ekfrasi	Ekfrasi is a dialect of Medusan, used by the Space Marines of the Iron Hands' Clan Kaargul.
Telapiye	The Telap were a xenos species that developed an advanced civilization at least a million years before M32, but were exterminated by the World Eaters Space Marine Legion during the Great Crusade. Members of the Telap species had two tongues, each of which was longer and more prehensile than a human's. As a result, their language, Telapiye, could not be completely re-created by a human tongue. Some of the books produced by the long-extinct species came into the possession of the Thousand Sons Space Marine Legion, and at least one survived the Burning of Prospero. Ahmuz Temekh was fluent in the language, though even his enhanced physiology could not produce the full range of its sounds.
Khorchin	Khorchin is a dialect of Low Gothic spoken by the people of the planet Chogoris, notably the Space Marines of the White Scars. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Graph-binarc	Graph-binarc is an Imperial sign language.
Battle-Sign	Battle-Sign is an Imperial Space Marine Sign Language, that was originally created by the Space Marine Legions. The Sign Language has diverged over the millennia, since the Legions' were divided into Chapters and each has adapted it for their own use. Hortcode was also used by the Legions, though what relation it had to Battle-Sign is not known.
Melancholia (sign)	The Melancholia was a symbol used by a faction within the Adeptus Mechanicus. It consisted of a parchment with the number four arranged in a four-by-four grid with all the numbers coming to the same answer, thirty-four. This symbol was used by those servants of Adept Koriel Zeth. Dalia Cythera noticed the parchment on the Mechanicum Protectors belonging to Adept Zeth and realized that she had seen the symbol in some books she had transcribed two years ago.
Necron Lexicon	Language and writing of the Necrons, most if not all of which are derived from the Necrontyr. All Necrons bear the mark of the Triarch, a brand upon their living metal skin that binds them to their race. Each Necron Dynasty will vary the colors of the Ankh and cartouche to match those of their phaeron. However, despite these cosmetic alterations, the shape of the Ankh remains unchanged, each exacting curve and line perfectly reproduced upon the Necrons’ chests. Glyphs are the Necron method of written communication, symbology, and iconography. Only nobles of the highest rank are permitted to bear their dynasty’s glyph in its fullest form. Those of lesser rank bear only elements of the glyph, and the warriors of their legions are marked with even simpler derivations of the same designs. In contrast, war engines, such as Monoliths and Doomsday Arks, often display their dynasty’s glyphs in full – they are considered to be the personal weaponry of a particular noble and therefore warrant a higher status than even the Necron Warriors that crew them.
Ylath	Ylath is a dialect of Hagia, used by the rustic herdsmen.
Trecenti	Trecenti is one of the encrypted languages of the moon Titan and is used by the Grey Knights. It is a runic alphabet that uses three hundred separate characters and has no spoken equivalent.
Fenris Vulgaris	Fenris Vulgaris is the dominant dialect of Low Gothic spoken by the people of the planet Fenris, including the Space Wolves. Juvykka,[2a] also called juvyk, is the hearth tongue of Fenris.[6a] It is a dialect of Fenrisian, and spoken by some of the human tribes that reside on the planet.[2a] The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Scrap Code	Scrapcode (also known as Lingua Diabolis) is a type of Warp-infested computer virus capable of infecting all forms of machinery. Scrapcode can be seen as the machine equivalent of the Dark Tongue, seemingly nonsensical at first but possessing an anarchic power that cripple a Machine Spirit and pervert a piece of technology to the cause of Chaos. It is said that even Knights and Titans have succumbed to this ravening, self-replicating scourge. Warpsmiths often oversee the implementation of Scrapcode, who turn have learned this art from the teachings of the Daemon Primarchs Mortarion and Perturabo. It is a language used by hereteks of the Dark Mechanicum to converse and commune with the Chaos Gods and their manifestations. Scrap-code manifestations are made of unholy energies. With proper precaution, scrap-code can quarantined from a communication carrier signal's substratum and be contained within a crystalflex flask, if it comes from a single channel. Scrap-code is as angry and aggressive as a caged feral animal, often shrieking and bashing against any form of containment. Its form is ever-changing, but tends to have tiny mouths. Its inconsistent form might shift from second to second between being a cloud of pinkish vapour, a swarm of numbers, or darts of circuit board light.
Konndar	Konndar is the dominant dialect on the planet Harakon.
Voidsys	Voidsys is an Imperial sign language.
Himalazian Base Code	Himalazian Base Code was a Terran-born machine language similar to lingua-technis used by the Ironwing of the Dark Angels Legion. Himalazian Base Code was employed throughout the systems of warships and equipment made use of by the First Legion, and was known to be difficult for Tech-Priests of the Mechanicum to comprehend, much to their frustration.
Ork Language	Ork Language is a crude compilation of various dialects and tongues used by Orks. The language that Orks speak reflects their nature, being a crude and unsubtle one, but possessing more insults and war terms than any other. It is known to consist of many dialects, that vary between different Clans and worlds. These dialects are changing as Orks migrate around the galaxy, contacting other species and adopting words from their languages. Orks often loot things they like from other races and particularly useful words and phases are no exception. Because of this, the Ork language includes many loan words, including the ones taken from Low Gothic; however, due to the their physiology Orks are unable to pronounce some sounds and most of those get heavily changed. It is speculated that at some point in history all Orks spoke the same form of the language, which Imperial scholars call Old High Orkish. The Ork language can be learned by humans to some extent, the most famous example being Sebastian Yarrick, who learned it from a captured greenskin. The Ork language uses a logographic system and is written in the form of glyphic script. Its core consists of glyphs that indicate Clan, Warband, common Ork concepts and elements of Ork names. These are augmented by phonetic runes that can be used to write most Ork words and words from other languages. The resulting script is mainly used to indicate ownership, signify tribal affiliation, record battle honours and other such tasks. They are not often used to write down history texts or battle manuals. Instead, Orks have a very strong oral tradition with myths and legends passed from Ork to Ork. Only Meks with their jargon write and share useful bits of knowledge.
Hortcode	Hortcode is a type of Sign Language that was known to the Perpetuals John Grammaticus and Ollanius Persson.[1b] During the Horus Heresy's Siege of Terra, however, Grammaticus was greatly surprised to discover that the Knight-Errant Loken knew it as well.[1c] In fact, Hortcode was used by the Space Marine Legions,[1a] though, it is not clear what relation the Sign Language had to Battle-Sign.
Sign Language	Sign Language is a type of non verbal communication, that uses hand signals and gestures. Several such languages exist within the Imperium, including Graph-binarc, Voidsys, the Sisters of Silence's Thoughtmark and the Space Marines' Battle-Sign. The Space Marine Legions also used Battle-Sign along with Hortcode,[2a] which was also known to the Perpetuals John Grammaticus and Ollanius Persson.[2b]
Enuncia	Enuncia is an ancient language, but instead of communication, the language was used as a tool or a weapon: when spoken aloud or written, Enuncia is capable of manipulating the very fabric of reality, a power beyond even the most potent psykers. It is incredibly dangerous, especially since it required no natural psyker ability, and could potentially be used by anyone. Enuncia is very obscure, with only a few fragmentary references appearing anywhere in Imperial records. Even fewer of these references include any information on the use of Enuncia. One theory states that Enuncia accounts for ancient human legends concerning the use of "magic"; another says that it was one of the tools of creation itself. In Terra's ancient past the Cognitae attempted to build a tower etched in Enuncia, but were foiled by the forces of the Emperor and Ollanius Persson. The few effects of Enuncia observed can include the control of daemons (without the usual bargaining), or as a potent weapon against enemies, causing physical damage to the target ranging from uncontrollable vomiting to cranial rupturing. However, the reality-warping effects can also damage the speaker, many of whom suffer wounds to their mouths and throats when speaking the words. Uniquely, neverborn are as suseptible to the effects of Enuncia as their counterparts in the materium. Likewise, machines attempting to process written forms of the language can suffer spontaneous breakdowns.
Stalk-Argot	Stalk-Argot was the language of the Shadowmasters of the Raven Guard legion during the Horus Heresy. Stalk-Argot is described as a combination of wind whispers and delicate sighs which was almost indistinguishable from the wind of Constanix. It is used by the Mor Deythan to issue commands when total secrecy and/or absolute silence is needed.
Lingua-technis	Lingua-technis or lingua technis, also known as techna-lingua[2b] and lingua technica, is a language of the Cant Mechanicus. The official lanuage of the Adeptus Mechanicus, this binary language has been optimised for quick communication of technical data and servitor commands.[2a] It is a language rarely used outside of the order of Tech-Priests, elements of the Techna-Lingua may be found integrated into the Low Gothic of highly industrialised or technologically oriented cultures. Few outside the Priesthood of Mars can fully comprehend Techna-Lingua, and it is a language replete with internal self-references and allusions to knowledge that remain unknown to those outside the Tech-Priests' closed orders. The Magi of the Adeptus Mechanicus have preserved this form of communication since the founding of their institution in the Dark Age of Technology, and by lore none should speak it forbidden phrases who have not been sanctified by the Machine God.[2b] Like most binary languages, lingua technis consists of a burst of static emitted through the bionic implants of members of the Mechanicum which cannot be understood by unaugmented humans. To the ignorant, voxed lingua technis might sound like little more than a blurted hash of machine noise.
Cant Mechanicus	The Cant Mechanicus is the term for the collective languages of the Adeptus Mechanicus. Few outside the Adeptus Mechanicus can comprehend these tongues, let alone reproduce them without augmented physiology. Many Tech-Priests have their jaws and throats altered, the better to speak languages that were designed only for cogitators to use. Furthermore, each language is replete with internal self-references and allusions to knowledge that remains unknown to those outside the order. Their use is forbidden by any not of the Cult Mechanicus. Much of these languages have words and even entire grammatical structures missing, eroded by the entropy of millennia or corrupted by scrapcode.
Low Gothic	Low Gothic (or Imperial Gothic) is the common language of the Imperium of Man. In the Age of the Imperium it is spoken as a first language on almost all civilised planets, and is accepted as a second language on planets within Imperial control with the exception of some medieval and feral worlds. Low Gothic is a bastardised version of High Gothic, combining additional elements from several of the oriental languages of ancient Terra. Over the millennia it has changed greatly, and now bears almost no resemblance to the tongues from which it derived. Although a common language, it varies from planet to planet (and even from region to region), so that it is not always easy for two characters to communicate if they are from different worlds. Medieval, feral and worlds suffering from long periods of isolation may have several indigenous languages derived either from High Gothic or one of the ancient Earth tongues. It was quite common during the Dark Age of Technology for worlds to be settled by small communities of "isolationists". These eccentric groups were often self-financed and their journeys unrecorded, many were of racial minorities attempting to recreate a sense of national identity away from the overpopulated Earth. Some of these groups made a deliberate attempt to revive long dead or moribund languages, perceiving them as a source of national identity and communal strength.
High Gothic	High Gothic is the hieratic tongue of the Imperium, used in the titles of ancient institutions and organisations (such as the Adeptus Terra). It represents an older language and is regarded as holy. High Gothic is a version of the language in which technical manuals and ancient works are recorded. This developed during the Dark Age of Technology. It derives from the common tongue of the time, an assimilation of English, European and Pacific languages, and developed in the Merican/Pacific region of Terra. This was the universal medium of written record until the Age of Strife, and was spoken as a first language by many and as a second language by almost everyone. Its idioms and vocabulary now appear archaic and mystic, and many of its words have acquired religious significance over the years. Low Gothic, a bastardised version of High Gothic, is the common tongue of the present Imperium.
Dark Tongue	The Dark Tongue, sometimes called Black Speech, is the language of Daemons and Chaos.[2j] Those who wish to communicate with Daemons or summon them from the Warp must learn this arcane ritual language, for its phonetic runes are the only manner in which the mysteries of Chaos can be truly expressed. The secrets of Chaos cannot be expressed in the simple tongues of mortals, all are insufficient to express the wonder and experience of transformation. They lack the words to encapsulate the nature of Chaos, even Aeldari cannot fully define the nature of Chaos using words alone. Only Black Speech can lift the lid and peer into the elusive, incomprehensible, and maddening experience of Chaos.[2j] Dark Tongue is a robust language loosely derived from the arcane language of Daemons. When written, it uses blasphemous Chaos runes that, even when drawn with ordinary materials, seem to crawl and writhe on the page. Used by Chaos's servants and its creatures, only those depraved of mind and wholly given over to the Ruinous Powers can appreciate its nuances.[2j]
Binharic	Binharic, also spelled binaric, or binharic cant is one of the Cant Mechanicus languages. Bihnaric code-strings are known for their clarity in conveying information.[3a] Binharic is the de facto language upon Forge Worlds and aboard Mechanicus vessels. Even those native to such locations not formally inducted into the ranks of the Cult Mechanicus can speak binharic to a degree, however, it is made much easier with the aid of mechanical augmentations. Without augmentations, only a crude approximation of binharic can be produced at a slowed that a human mouth and vocal cords can produce. Vox-emitters and clarions on Mechanicus vessels typically blare binharic code rather than Gothic speech.[3c] Binharic can be conveyed both through vox clicks and through the noosphere. Statements can be conveyed over vox-bursts, and while binharic is still more efficient than Gothic, noospheric communion is the most efficient form of communication since information is conveyed at the speed of thought.[3b]
Aeldari	Aeldari, the Eldar term for their species are an ancient naturally psychic race of elf-like humanoids created as weapons by the Old Ones to win the War in Heaven in the aftermath of which their Empire dominated the Galaxy through its use of the Webway, but their empire has collapsed and now they are currently a dying race. After the Fall the Eldar homeworlds became the Crone Worlds of the Eye of Terror and their people were scattered throughout the Webway and among the stars into a myriad of different factions and allegiances including the Asuryani who fled the empire in its final days and survive on planetoid-sized vessels known as Craftworlds, the Drukhari who hid away in the ancient city of Commoragh built in the Webway before the empire fell,[10a] the Exodites who fled early to verdant Maiden Worlds on the far edges of the galaxy, the secretive Harlequins who keep hidden the Black Library and keep alive the history of the Eldar, the death cult of the Ynnari, and the various bands of outcast corsairs, renegades, and pirates who make up the Anhrathe. Superficially, the Eldar appear very similar to humans, though they are generally taller and slimmer, with sharp features and pointed ears. It is stated that they are genetically similar to humanity; to the point that a magos studying the biology of the Eldar found the similarity 'impossible to ignore'.[Note] They are long-lived by human standards, and most will live more than a thousand years unless they die from accident or disease. The average Eldar lifespan is estimated at over two thousand years, as they record it having been five generations since the Fall of the Eldar. Eldar seem to reproduce in stages, with new genetic material being added by the father to the developing embryo over an extended period though this process is ill-understood, speculated from autopsies performed by Mechanicus Magus. It is however known that the Eldar gestation cycle is much longer than for most other races.
Jetbike	The Jetbikes are highly-advanced anti-gravity vehicles, that are able to use subtle manipulation of an anti-gravity field to combine high speeds with incredible agility and manoeuvrability. Jetbike could refer to one of the following vehicles:
Lsathranil’s Shield (Planet)	Lsathranil’s Shield was an Eldar Exodite World that fell when when "the Great Conflagration" consumed the planet, a refugee population now live on Craftworld Kaelor.[Help] The planet was home to the Caradoch, a furry quadruped that became extinct even before the desertification (and eventual destruction) of the planet because it lacked the faculty of suspicion. Caradoch became an affectionate name for an aging eldar among the exodite colonists of Lsathranil’s Shield, eventually becoming a loanword among the eldar of Kaelor.
Shadowseer	Shadowseers are significant characters in Harlequin Troupes. Shadowseers are specialist phantasmancer psykers that belong to the Eldar race and are seen within the ranks of the Harlequins, with their abilities focusing particularly on skills relating to confusion as well as fear. Their presence adds to the potency of any performances by their kin as they release programmed hallucinations by way of their creidann grenade launcher backpacks. During masques, a Shadowseer serves the role of a storyteller, forming scintillating phantoms that dance and duel in the air. However, when called to battle, they are able to force visions of unholy terror on their foes or even remove the presence of the Harlequins from their minds completely. These Seers play the role of fate and fortune within their performances with it being said that they know the doom of all their companions - even for the Great Harlequins themselves. These powerful psykers are known for the potency of their psychic abilities, which are as great as those of a Farseer of the Craftworlds. Shadowseers, in terms of appearance, tend to wear masks like all Harlequins, though theirs are uniquely blank and smooth. As such, it is claimed that those who see into their faces often see a different visage reflecting back at them which can either be their own face in a future or alternate time.

Vindicare (Short Story)	Seven days ago, the eldar descended upon Orphean Trine. The Swordwind of Craftworld Biel-Tan has swept all before it, with just a single city remaining intact. As the defenders, bolstered by Space Marines of the Dark Angels, prepare to sell their lives dearly in a last stand, a single hope remains: Nyjia, a lone Vindicare Assassin, who waits to get that one, vital, shot.
Spirit stone	The Eldar spirit stones or waystones are small, seemingly precious stones carried on an Eldar's chest, used to save their souls from destruction by Slaanesh.[3a] Spirit Stones are faceted psycho-receptive crystals called carrecenad or soul-stone. Eldar at large believe they are grown in a way similar to Wraithbone. However, it is a well kept secret even among the Eldar themselves that spirit-stones are actually formed from the ghosts of eldar who died during the Fall of the Eldar, their spirits tormented by Slaanesh to see the lives they can no longer possess ripped from them and reenacting the fall. As these ghost reenact their death, they leave behind soul stones which are then collected to be given to Craftworld eldar at birth. At the moment of the Eldar's death, the stone acts like a 'psychic trap', absorbing their psychic self and preventing it from entering the warp and being consumed by the nemesis of the Eldar race: Slaanesh.[3a] The Waystone can then be brought back to the Eldar's own Craftworld and embedded into its wraithbone core where it will grow into a larger spirit stone.[3a] Once the stone is implanted, the Eldar's soul can travel freely through the wraithbone, mingling with other Eldar souls and forming part of the communal spirit of the Craftworld itself.[3a] All the souls within a Craftworld collectively exist inside the Infinity Circuit.[3a] In times of dire need, the Eldar are also able to retrieve the spirit stones of long dead Eldar heroes and place them into the artificial bodies of Wraithguards and Wraithlords.[3b] These constructs are then piloted by the Eldar soul, which experiences reality as a dream. This process is considered necromancy in Eldar culture and is only used as a last resort. The Eldar Warlocks who specialize in this process are known as Spiritseers.[3c] Iyanden, an Eldar Craftworld with a very small population is known for its greater use of these 'living dead'.[3b]
Phoenix Lord	The Phoenix Lords are amongst the most ancient and renowned heroes of the Eldar race.[1a] Should they be vanquished, their essence will lie dormant inside their armor until it is donned by another Eldar warrior whose soul resonates. Should they prove worthy enough to combine souls, the Phoenix Lord will be reborn in a new body. No matter how many individuals a Phoenix Lord may have been, their mind is forever the same, driven by the personality of the first and greatest to wear the suit. Often, Phoenix Lords will vanish for centuries, only to reappear in times of great need to those who follow the Path of Khaine across the universe. The Phoenix lords are Exarchs so ancient that they have no shrines and no Craftworlds to call home. They wander from world to world, instinctively driven by war, attracted by intuitive power to places of great danger and need. During moments of desperation they appear, sometimes alone but often several together, depending upon the perils faced. Using the Eldar Webway they move from Craftworld to Craftworld and from planet to planet, following in the path of the Bloody-handed God.[1a] The Phoenix Lords are immortal, after a fashion. When a Phoenix Lord is slain in battle, his place is taken by another Eldar who assumes his costume and identity. In this way the Phoenix Lord is reborn into a fresh cycle of existence. His suit includes a spirit stone which contains the spirits of all the Eldar who have become that Phoenix Lord. Yet, no matter how many different individuals a Phoenix Lord may have been, his mind is forever the same, driven by the dominant personality of the first and greatest warrior to wear the suit.[1b]
Path of the Eldar (Omnibus)	Path of the Eldar is an anthology published in the Path of the Eldar Series. The eldar of the craftworlds devote their lives to the pursuit of perfection, following a series of paths which will their actions and decide their fates. Three friends – Korlandril, Thirianna and Aradryan – part company to walk their chosen paths – Warrior, Seer and Outcast – little realising how the actions of one will affect the others, and indeed their world. As Aradryan’s choices bring the wrath of the Imperium down upon Alaitoc, it falls to Korlandril and Thirianna to defend their home – if they can avoid becoming stuck on their paths and being lost forever.
Death Jester	Death Jesters, or Death-heads (margorach), are Harlequin heavy weapon specialists. Death Jesters stand apart from the rest of the force, providing much of the masque's heavy weapon support. In performance, their role is to play Death—they perform death-defying stunts and escapology. They are known for their morbid and ironic sense of humour, and their mocking laughter is known to signal impending death. The macabre uniform of the Death Jester is constructed from the bones of the troupe's previous Death Jester—and when one dies, his bones are used to fashion his successor's costume. Death Jesters seek new and inventive ways to terrorize and eventually kill their victims. They can sometimes be heard humming softly in the midst of battle, and will occasionally pause to bow or offer mocking applause to a foe. Killing a foe is not enough for a Death Jester. To make war worthwhile, they must intersperse murder with ironic humor. Slaying an officer at a crescendo of a rallying speech or sending sappers fleeing into a minefield they just got finished laying are examples of this macabre sense of humor.
Aurelian (Novella)	Silver Edition:ISBN 9781849702362 Aurelian is a novella written by Aaron Dembski-Bowden and is part of The Horus Heresy series. The novella was originally published as a A5 hardback novella and available in two editions: 3,000 Gold (slightly differently bound, signed and with interior art plates) and 3,000 Silver (simply bound and without a signature or interior art). Aurelian was subsequently included in the anthology Eye of Terra.
Biel-tan	Biel-Tan is an Eldar Craftworld, famous for its extreme militarism. Biel-Tan spends most of it's deadly effort on the Galactic South, at the outermost edge of the Aeldari Empire. As well as their traditional colours of green and white, the forces of Biel-Tan sport patterns of dark thorny ivy.[2c] The Biel-tan Craftworld is famous for its inhabitants' militancy; it is home to more Aspect Warriors than any other craftworld[2a], and is renowned for it's strong warrior ideals holding a strong honour code and believing the best way to die is in battle against the enemies of the Eldar. The Eldar of Biel-tan are honourable warriors who have taken it upon themselves to rebuild the lost glory of the ancient Eldar empire, through the destruction of the lesser races who have "usurped" the galaxy, and believe it is glorious to die fighting the enemies of the Craftworld. At the centre of Biel-tan is the Chamber of Heroes where the spirit stones of dead Aspect Warriors are placed. Farseers often come to this room to consult the dead on courses of action.[Needs Citation] The Exarchs of the Craftworld form a council known as the Court of the Young King, which decides foreign policy for the craftworld – both military and diplomatic relations – it is from this council that the Craftworld's Young Kings are chosen.[2a]
Support Weapon Battery	A Support Weapon Battery, also known as Vaul's Wrath, is an Eldar heavy weapons team consisting of one to three large Grav Platforms which mount either D-Cannons, Vibro Cannons or Shadow Weavers. These batteries are often used when a force is advancing or to form a solid defensive line. While they must be stationary in order to fire, these units provide tremendous firepower to the Eldar and use advanced targeting arrays for pinpoint accuracy against even well-hidden foes. Two Guardians operate each platform, and some batteries will be joined by a Warlock during battle. A Biel-tan Shadow Weaver Battery
Maugan Ra	"Let not the fear of death stay your hand nor defeat your courage. The warrior who will prevail is the one who conquers death, who becomes one with death as we have." Maugan Ra (literally, "the Harvester of Souls" in Eldar) is an Eldar Phoenix Lord from the doomed Craftworld Altansar. He is also the brother of Baharroth, like the moon is to the sun.
Rhana Dandra	Rhana Dandra is the Eldar name for the final great battle with Chaos. It is written about in the Asuryata, which predicts the destruction of the Eldar and their remaining gods. It is said that the battle will destroy both the materium and immaterium. The Phoenix Lord Fuegan is said to be the one who will call the other Phoenix Lords together for the final battle and will be the last to die in the fighting, while Phoenix Lord Baharroth will also die his final death. Since the Fall of the Eldar, a crystal tome bounded with chains of light has rested upon an obsidian plinth at the heart of the Black Library. As fabled events came to pass, so those chains faded one by one until the tome opened shortly before the opening of the Great Rift. Revealed within were writings said to have been written by Cegorach itself, telling of a final act that changed utterly the tale of the Fall. Instead of the Rhana Dandra, the final act tells of Cegorach's ultimate jest that would trick Slaanesh into expending all of her energies to save the Eldar instead of destroying them. How such an event could come to pass remains unclear.
Harlequin	The Harlequins, as you may or may not know, are a faction of the Eldar race to whom the responsibility of remembrance falls. They travel from Craftworld to Craftworld, keeping the legends and ancient history of the Eldar race alive through their dance, drama and martial performance. The Harlequins are both servants of the Laughing God - the only deity of their race to survive the mighty Fall - and custodians of the hallowed Black Library of Chaos. For the Harlequins there is no distinction between art and war; they are the archetypal warrior poets, travelling the labyrinthine expanses of the Webway, bringing enlightenment to their audiences and certain death to the servants of darkness. The Harlequins, or Rillietann[1a], are a unique subset of the Eldar race, who split their time between being talented battlefield fighters and theatrical performers. They exist outside of normal Eldar society and hold no allegiance to any Craftworld, Kabal, or other form of authority other than to their own belief in the Eldar deity Cegorach, the Laughing God.[1a]
Asuryan	Asuryan, also known as the Phoenix King was the eldest and most senior of all the Eldar Gods. He is said to have given the mortal Aeldari the gifts of wisdom and introspection, and is revered by seers of all kinds. His first brother is the War God, Kaela Mensha Khaine.[1a] The goddess Gea is said to have held both Asuryan and Khaine as her twin consorts. He is known as the preserver, and father of the gods and the ancestor of all living things.[1d] In the oldest legends of the Eldar, it is said that a vision of the future by the goddess Lileath showed that Khaine would be torn asunder by an army of mortals. In his rage, the War God turned his wrath against the Eldar with their mother, the goddess Isha, weeping tears for her children. The Phoenix King heard her cries and upon learning of Khaine's plans, Asuryan created a great barrier that separated the realm of the gods from mortals for all eternity. This left Isha distraught for being separated from her children and thus she, along with her husband, Kurnous, went before the Smith God Vaul who fashioned from her tears the Spirit Stones through which she spoke to the Eldar. After overhearing her speaking to them, Khaine informed his brother and the Phoenix King was enraged that his command had been broken. Thus, he told Khaine to do with Isha and Kurnous as he saw fit for their act of betrayal against him.[1c] During the events of the War in Heaven, a war raged between the gods and the race of immortal demi-god giants known as the Yngir. In this time, Asuryan despaired of the devastation wrought by his brother Khaine, with him regretting his hasty anger towards Isha and Kurnous. Despite this being the case, he refused to take sides during the conflict and neither favoured Khaine nor the Children of Isha. In this manner, he chose wisely and remained as lord of both sides.[1e] However, it was said that the Father of the Eldar battled Kaelis Ra but neither side was able to gain supremacy over the other. In desperation to save his children, the Eldar, he rearranged the suns themselves to create a constellation that spelt an ill omen for his foe and harnessed their might into a solar flare that mortally wounded Kaelis Ra. Following the Fall of the Eldar, it is said within the Eldar legends that their gods were all killed by Slaanesh who not only destroyed them but also stole their power.[1b]
Holo-suit	Holo-suits (dathedi in Eldar, translated as "between colours") are used by the Harlequins. Each contains a programmable holo-field which breaks up the outline of the wearer as they move. Whenever anyone wearing this armour moves, it appears that their outline explodes in a flash of light and when he stops the image reconstitutes itself. It is also known as a jigsaw field or domino field. Also, when the wearer stops moving his outline blends into the surrounding landscape. This makes them very hard to fight in combat, easily disorientating their enemies.
Khymera	Khymerae are Warp-beasts born from the stuff of a Daemon World. They coalesce around vivid nightmares into terrifying forms of long-fanged, many-eyed, sinewy cat-like beasts. Dark Eldar Beastmasters enter dream-quests in order to hunt down Khymera in the spirit realm and draw packs of them back into Realspace. They then enslave them as half-real nightmares that can wreak utter havoc upon a battlefield before fading away like mist. Kyhmera are utilized by some within the Forces of Chaos as they are useful of tracking down Psykers or anything else with Warp-taint. As they exist in a state of half-immaterial half-material, they are useful in fighting Sisters of Silence.
Dire Avenger	Dire Avengers are one of the forms of Eldar Aspect Warrior. The Dire Avengers follow Khaine in his aspect as a noble and merciless warrior, and are the most tactically flexible and numerous of all the Aspect Warriors.[1a][2a] The Dire Avengers trace their lineage back to Asurmen, the first of the Phoenix Lords and founder of the Aspect Shrines. It is because of Asurmen that the Dire Avengers are the most common of the Aspect Warriors, as he founded more Shrines on more Craftworlds than any other Phoenix Lord.[1d] The Dire Avengers' signature weapon is the Avenger Shuriken Catapult, a modified version of the typical Shuriken Catapult with an extended barrel, power feed and inbuilt rangefinder. To wield a shuriken is considered an art form by Dire Avengers, who use the deadly weapons in battle to create impenetrable storms of monomolecular blades which slice their enemies to ribbons. Even when a Dire Avenger has removed their armour and left their shrine, they will keep these razor-sharp discs hidden under their clothing, never truly unarmed.[2a] Like other Aspect Warriors, Dire Avengers wear Aspect Armour, psychically activated bodysuits which stiffen on impact to absorb a blow while moulding to fit the warrior's body and allow free range of movement. Dire Avenger armour is predominately coloured blue, with a distinctive high crested helm which makes them taller without adding bulk.[1b] A tabard is also a common addition, with runic inscriptions identifying the name of the warrior's Shrine and Craftworld of origin, and both it and the helm are always painted in a contrasting white colour. The long top crest is often made of exotic animal hair dyed to match the colour scheme of their Craftworld as well. In addition, the small blisters and domes dotting the armour's surface are small compartments containing the suit's technical systems, and over each Dire Avenger's shoulder is an advanced targeter which connects to the Avenger Catapult through the handle. This pan-spectral rangefinder system operates independently of the Dire Avenger and is capable of tracking multiple targets simultaneously, differentiating between friend and foe, and feeding this information directly to the warrior's helm display.
Solitaire	Solitaires are Harlequins who are chosen by Cegorach to tread upon the Path of Damnation and forfeit their essence to Slaanesh, fated to be claimed by the Prince of Excess.[3b][4a] At their death, Cegorach himself fights for their souls in an uneven battle with She-Who-Thirsts.[3b] Only through trickery, the Laughing God can win them back. They are outsiders, even among the Harlequins, and roam the universe alone, occasionally joining a masque for a single performance or battle as the fancy takes them. They almost always fight as individuals.[3b] They walk unseen and unnoticed even among other races, as they are said to be touched by the Great Harlequin directly, Eldar folk tales tell many accounts of a hero not realizing that instead with a Solitaire they met with Cegorach himself. In the Harlequin masques, they play the part of Slaanesh, as all others who attempt to play this part are driven mad by the experience.[3b] The Solitaires seek out Eldar considered promising and able to survive the trial that all Harlequins must endure. Though they are capable of speech, they do not speak and are not spoken to, except in ritual form during a performance. It is said that any who accidentally addresses or touches a Solitaire is cursed, and would be better to take their own life outright.[3b]
Shuriken Catapult	Shuriken Catapults are a type of Eldar Shuriken Weapon. The standard type, firing razor-sharp monomolecular discs capable of slicing through flesh and penetrating a considerable thickness of plasteel armour. Humans sometimes refer to these weapons as star slingers or just slingers or sling guns, while its Eldar name is tuelean. The shuriken catapult is the basic weapon of the Guardians, the citizen-militia of the Craftworlds, and is incorporated to certain other systems such as Eldar Jetbikes.

Aza'gorod	The Aza'gorod, the Nightbringer (Eldar Kaelis Ra)[1b] is a C'tan, a living god of the Necrons, that survives as fragmented shards. The Nightbringer's earliest history is that of a pioneer and death bringer. Its love of pain and death is monumental, a living god of suffering and despair. When the Necrontyr first encouraged the C'tan to cross the Incorporeal Starlight Bridge into the material realm, the Nightbringer was the first to come and the first to enter a living metal body. It was found feeding on the very star that blasted the Necrontyr. Once it had become manifest, it soon learned that the life force of mortal lives tasted far superiour to its previous diet of star energy and with this revelation it consumed those who had brought it into the material universe. Only through pledges of loyalty could the Necrontyr convince it to stop destroying their race and concentrate in the vast expanses of the galaxy.[1b] This initial episode of mortal consumption led to more destruction on the behalf of the Nightbringer. At this time the Necrontyr had been waging battle against the race known as the Old Ones. They had brought the Star Gods into the mortal plane to help them in their war. Like the other C’tan, the Nightbringer craved worshippers and slaves to satisfy its monstrous ego. Many of its servants descended into murderous insanity, unable to withstand the bloody visions their master's presence brought on. The Nightbringer reveled in the war with the Old Ones as nothing but mortal souls could satisfy its hunger. At first eagerly throwing itself at the Old Ones, in its desire to consume more souls the Nightbringer would lay waste to entire regions of space just to feed. It is said that gradually, the Nightbringer fell further and further from the original design the Necrontyr had brought it into the material world for, namely the destruction of the Old Ones. It began to destroy and feed at will, and it reached into the minds of almost every race and planted its image into their deepest fears. The destruction wrought by the Nightbringer was so great that the trauma is still felt by millions of species across the galaxy. It is said that it nurtured entire races to fear it and it fed on that fear.[1b]
Eagle Pilot	Eagle Pilots, known as Amon Harakht are Eldar who follow the Aspect Warrior Path of the pilots of Eagle Bombers. Piloting Eldar aircraft, Eagle Pilots' skill combined with their advanced aircraft are capable of great feats of maneuverability. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here. Two years after Shadow Point's release, Star Eagles would be listed as an aspect in White Dwarf 302 (UK). It is possible, given the similarity of name, the generic nature of the term Eagle Pilot, as well as the relative closeness of publication that the two were intended to be the same concept.
Shuriken Pistol	Shuriken Pistols are a type of Eldar Shuriken Weapon. The Shuriken Pistol is the smaller version of the Shuriken Catapult and is fired one-handed. Shurikens fired from the pistol are identical to those used in catapults, but the weapon itself has a shorter barrel and smaller energy capacity, resulting in limited range, rate of fire and power. Humans sometimes refer to this weapon as a slinger or sling pistol, while its Eldar name is murehk. It is a common backup sidearm for many Eldar warriors, and is one of the primary weapons of the Howling Banshees and Striking Scorpions.

Lu'Nasad	Lu'Nasad is an abandoned Eldar Craftworld, now known as Dresil'ach the Forgotten Ruin. At the moment of Slaanesh's birth at the Fall of the Eldar Lu'nasad was boarding refugees on the outer rim of what would become the Eye of Terror. Within hours they would be overrun by Daemons, requiring them to plan a desperate escape: to flee by way of an ancient and unknown Webway path. This path would not lead them to salvation, but instead to ruin as it lead directly into the Rifts of Hecaton - a roiling Warp-storm.[1a] Only a small escape vessel would manage its purpose, helmed by Farseer Anaris to land amidst the Koronus Expanse, its crew succumbing to Warp disruption as they fled, the rest of the craftworld's populace would also perish in short order.[1a] In 0965.M40 the Spirit Stone of Anaris was discovered by Lord Inquisitor Kobras Aquairre and accidentally called the ship from the warp, bringing it into the Koronus Expanse.[1c]
Callidus Temple	"To assume the shape of the accursed, and deliver death from the purity within you." The Callidus Temple is one of the temples of the Officio Assassinorum. They specialise in trickery, deception, deceit, infiltration and impersonation. The Callidus Assassins are the most cunning of all the assassins. Their greatest asset is their ability to use the shape-changing drug Polymorphine. This drug, coupled with special training, allows Callidus agents to change their very shape and appearance allowing them to impersonate other persons, members of the opposite sex, and even humanoid xenos like Orks and Eldar. Meh'Lindi, one of the most cunning agents, managed to successfully impersonate a Genestealer Hybrid at least twice (though she required additional surgery to complete the illusion).
Wraithbone	Wraithbone is a psycho-plastic substance used by the Eldar for many different tasks, including the construction of buildings, ships and weapons. Wraithbone is essentially solidified warp energy that is manipulated by a Bonesinger into any shape that is required. All Eldar have the innate power to mould wraithbone, but Bonesingers spend several human lifetimes cultivating the art of using their psychomorphic talents to accelerate the formation of psychotropic crystals found in Wraithbone. Fragments of wraithbone can be used to seed new structures. Often holding the fragment in place via telekinesis and coaxing the wraithbone fragment to take root and begin to grow, following the desired pattern, at which point it is released from the Eldar's telekinetic hold. Older pieces of wraithbone take more time and coaxing to change their form, growing slowly. Metal cannot shatter wraithbone. It is stronger than any known plasteel and harder to damage than adamantium, with 8-10mm of wraithbone being equivalent to 30-45mm of Imperial armour material, and will naturally repair itself, though the process can be sped up by a Bonesinger. Wraithbone itself is a thousand times stronger than steel.
Eldar Quotes	This article collects all quotes made by, or about, the Aeldari, excluding the Harlequins and Drukhari. The quotes themselves are organized in Alphabetical order using the speaker's name. When one truly understands fate as it is, myriad branching paths, then one can truly see that duty is cleaving to a particular fate, and glory is the accomplishment of duty’s ends. When we are true to the nature of the Eldar, we cannot fail. not to quarrel with one another about who breathes life into the flame.
Eldar Knights	Eldar Knights are a kind of Knight warmachine utilized by Exodite clans. Eldar Knights are most commonly used by Exodite populations to defend their homeworlds, and are complex machines made of a psycho-plastic known as Wraithbone. Eldar Knight war-machines were brought from the Aeldari Dominion during the Exodus to help the new Exodite colonies on Maiden Worlds to herd Megasaurs and to help to survive against the hostile and grim conditions they faced. Since The Coming of Men during the Dark Age of Technology, Eldar Knights have been deployed through Webway portals to raid the herds of the Knight Worlds (herds humans learned to care for from observing the Eldar during the Age of Strife) and defend against mankind's further expansion.
Infinity Circuit	Every Eldar Craftworld contains an Infinity Circuit, which is essentially the Wraithbone skeleton of the Craftworld itself. Within this matrix, the souls of all the Craftworld's dead reside in a form of group consciousness, providing both a well of psychic power for the ship and a massive ancestral mind to advise and guide the living. With the rise of Slaanesh, the Infinity Circuit is the closest thing that the Eldar have to an afterlife; if their souls are not caught and integrated into it, they will be lost into the warp and devoured by the Great Enemy. For this reason the Eldar will defend their Craftworlds with a fury and tenacity almost unrivalled; they risk losing not only their home but the souls of their ancestors as well. Although the Eldar souls preserved in the Craftworlds' Infinity Circuits can muster only a tiny amount of energy compared to that of Slaanesh, the Eldar hope that one day there will be enough souls to unite to fight and overthrow Slaanesh. It is a faint hope, but the only hope for the Eldar who otherwise face damnation and extinction from their own racial daemon. Early Infinity Circuit technology on Iyanden is said to have been mastered by Mehlendri Silversoul.
Phantom Titan	The Phantom Titan is the largest of the Eldar Titans. Phantom Titans are graceful constructs with superior agility and speed compared to other Titans. The pinnacle of Eldar warpcraft, each one is constructed around a Wraithbone core, a psychic material which allows the souls of deceased Eldar contained within Spirit Stones to move freely throughout the machine. This gives the Titan a consciousness of its own, which merges with that of the Phantom's crew and helps guide them. Some Phantom Titans will have a single steersman pilot them, while others will instead be guided by twins or triplets, but regardless, when their consciousness merges with that of the Titan's they create one sentience able to think, react, and move with the speed of an Aspect Warrior. The Titan's crew controls their war engine from the head cockpit, giving them a good view from 25 meters above the ground. The Phantom's primary arm mounts can be fitted with some of the Eldar's largest and deadliest weapons. These include twin Phantom Titan Pulsars, Distortion Cannons or a special Power Glaive known as the Ashuna-Valcry'le. Secondary weapons mounted in its shoulders include Phantom Missile Launchers and either a Pulse Laser or Titan-grade Starcannon. It is also protected by a Titan-grade Holo-Field projected by the large rear fins.
Rogue Trader	A Rogue Trader is a combination of freelance explorer, conquistador and merchant. They are Imperial servants, given a ship, a crew, a contingent of marines or Guardsmen and carte blanche to roam the worlds beyond Imperial control.[1b] In their task of exploring and exploiting uncharted regions of the galaxy, Rogue Traders might come across worlds harbouring long-forgotten Human civilizations which will be incorporated into the Imperium. Other times they find empty or alien-dominated planets ripe for colonisation or exploitation.[1b] All Rogue Traders are highly exceptional individuals who are driven to success even though these exceptional people often have extreme character quirks themselves; some destroy entire worlds for the slightest reason, or include alien warriors and mutants among their entourage.[1c] Some are highly pious while others are no more than legitimised pirates. One infamous Rogue Trader was Jan van Yastobaal, who became little more than a desperado plundering whatever world he came upon.

Low Commorragh	Low Commorragh is a region of Commorragh, home of the Dark Eldar. Once the trading districts from the days before Asdrubael Vect's rise to power, when the Noble Houses ruled, Low Commorragh now lies in ruins and poverty. Overcrowded and full of beasts, cutthroats, scavengers, slaves, and other deranged individuals it is extremely dangerous to an unescorted traveller. Now a massive maze of catacombs shielded from Commorragh's stolen suns, it is said that only the lost and feral thrive in the lower districts of Commorragh.
Council of Coalition	The Council of Coalition was a council called by Eldrad Ulthran in an attempt to unite the Aeldari. The council ended in a brief but devastating battle that included a las'raichan bhlàrmhori - one of the rare conflicts between Phoenix Lords, in which Asurmen, Jain Zar and Baharroth fought with Maugan Ra and Karandras – only by Fuegan's intervention did the conflict came to an end.
Angel Exterminatus	'Guilt upon the soul, like rust upon iron, both defiles and consumes it, gnawing and creeping into it, until at last it eats out the very heart and substance of the metal. But if all the world hates you, and believes you wicked, while your own conscience absolves you from guilt, you will not be without friends.' 2012 audiobookISBN 9780857876393 2013 trade paperbackISBN 9781849703598
Troupe Master	Avatars, (Eldar: Athairs) are the Troupe Masters: the leaders of Harlequin Troupes. Troupe Masters are closer to the lead players of a cast than formal commanders; they are elevated by will of their comrades, playing their role until it is time for another to take their place.[1a] This status will be marked out by their wardrobe and equipment choice, as well as the possession of a number of small batons which unfold into a flag representing the Harlequin masque the troupe belongs to (if any). This flag is generally left behind after an action, as a 'calling-card'. On the stage, Avatars play the part of Eldar Gods.[1a]
Tales from the Dark Millennium (Anthology)	Tales from the Dark Millennium is a compilation of short stories set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe edited by Christian Dunn and Marc Gascoigne. It was first published in 2006 by the Black Library. It is based on the card game Dark Millennium by Sabertooth Games. The Pyrus Reach Sector is under attack from the vast hordes of Chaos, orks and eldar and it falls to the brave defenders of humanity to stem the tide. Many will be called upon to give their lives in the name of the God-Emperor, but is it a price they are willing to pay? An uprising of heretic cultists on the world of Cordassa brings the Dark Angels Chapter of Space Marines to the world. But is their mission to help the beleaguered defenders of the troubled planet, or do they have their own agenda? Only Interrogator-Chaplain Artemius knows, though Inquisitor Mattius Heiron has his suspicions, and will go to any lengths to learn the truth.
Kabal of the Black Heart	The Kabal of the Black Heart is the single largest and most powerful Kabal in Commorragh, and because of this, they are the dominant power in the city. The Kabal's Supreme Lord is Asdrubael Vect, the oldest known Dark Eldar, and the supposed founder of the Dark City itself. The fact that the Kabal's founder is old enough to have witnessed first hand the birth of Slaanesh means that, along with being the largest and most powerful Kabal, they are also the first Kabal to be founded. The Kabal of the Black Heart is the oldest and greatest of its kind. Founded by Vect, it was originally the Cult of the Black Heart and fought against the Sun Cults of Commorragh in its early days. However, Vect eventually used it as a tool to topple the nobility of the Dark City, and declared it the first Dark Eldar Kabal. It is a vast and sprawling organisation, able to support numerous rival Archons within its hierarchical structure. Each Archon controls a separate faction within the Black Heart, and each vies fiercely with his rivals for the patronage of Supreme Overlord Vect. None brave outright murder, however, for only a fool would blunt one of Asdrubael Vect’s favorite tools. So complete is Vect’s stranglehold upon Commorragh that none of these highly placed subordinate Archons dare challenge the Overlord’s supremacy in anything but the most private dreams or fantasies. Even then, they do so with caution, for it is said that Vect knows well the scent of treachery, and reads the minds of lesser mortals like an open book.
Avatar	Avatars are incarnations of the Eldar War God, Kaela Mensha Khaine. During the Fall of the Eldar, Khaine fought with Slaanesh shortly after his birth, following the destruction of the Eldar Gods. During the battle, Khaine's essence was dismantled and scattered across the many galaxies, landing in the hearts of the remaining Eldar Craftworlds. Wherever his essence landed, a wraith artefact was created, allowing future Eldar to be able to summon him when needed. The Avatar sits at the heart of every one of the Eldar Craftworld. Once a year, one of the Exarchs of a Craftworld is chosen by its Farseers to hold the title of Young King. When a Craftworld prepares for a major war, its Exarchs begin to feel the Avatar's call. The Exarchs go to the door leading into the Avatar's chamber. There they begin the ancient ritual to rouse the Avatar, where they anoint the Young King and sing battle hymns. The Young King is given the mantle of the Craftworld, to identify to the Avatar of their allegiance, followed by filling a cup with the Young King's blood. Then the chamber's door opens and wielding The Wailing Doom and the bloody cup in each hand the Young King enters. The Exarchs continue the ritual at the entrance. It may take hours or days, but finally a terrible scream echoes from the chamber and the Avatar rises. There is no sign of the Young King - it is unknown whether the Young King is united with Khaine or is destroyed. On the battlefield, the Avatar towers above the Eldar warriors, his presence filling them with memories of their glorious past and with savage bloodlust, thus making them more courageous fighters. He is utterly fearless, and often spearheads the Eldar attack, slaying his foes with The Wailing Doom, a legendary weapon that can take the form of a sword, axe or spear. The weapon can even smite his foes at a distance, immolating them with a nimbus of burning psychic energy. In melee Avatar crush its foes with a mighty Hand of Khaine - molten metal gauntlet that constantly bathed in the still-warm blood of a young Aspect Warrior.
Khaine	The Eldar God Kaela Mensha Khaine (normally abbreviated to Khaine) also known as the Lord of Murder , is associated with murder, violence, destruction and war. Though shattered in his duel with Slaanesh during the Fall of the Eldar Khaine lives on in fragments lodged within the craftworlds of the aeldari and it is from Khaine's that Aspect Warriors derive their aspects. Khaine is one of the three surviving gods of the Eldar. In the old pantheon, he was second only to Asuryan himself in power, and was often shown as the enemy of Vaul. He is also the most violent and reckless of the gods. Asuryan was so appalled by his murder of Eldanesh, a mortal, that he cursed Khaine and made his hands drip eternally with the blood of Eldanesh so that everyone would remember what he had done. Many scholars believe him to be a manifestation of the Eldar's racial passion as manifested in battle and warfare. "Kaela Mensha" is not technically part of Khaine's name, but is a title he bears. It roughly translated to "bloody-handed", a reference to the blood that eternally drips from his hands as a reminder of his murder of the ancient Eldar hero, Eldanesh. The word Khaine signifies the essence of murder.
Dark Son (Short Story)	"Dark Son" is a short story by Gav Thorpe. Fear drives the drukhari – fear of She Who Thirsts, the monstrous Chaos God who would consume their souls. For the incubus Kolidaran, that fear drives him, like all his kind, down dark paths and into committing terrible acts to stave Slaanesh's jaws away from his soul. But when an attack on their Craftworlder kin leads to Kolidaran being imprisoned on Alaitoc, he begins to see that there might be another, better way to secure his soul, and takes his first steps on the Path of the Warrior...
Scatter Laser	The Scatter Laser is a heavy laser weapon commonly used by the Eldar. Originally created for War Walkers and Wraithlords, is also acts as a support weapon for Guardian squads, where it is mounted on a Grav Platform. The weapon is comprised of six separate laser chambers which can be fired simultaneously or in bursts, at either the same or different targets, and uses crystalline power cells to store energy. It is similar in some respects to the Imperium's Multi-laser, but far more refined and energy-efficient. The Eldar name for this weapon is Sierbahn. Ghostaxe • Power Weapon • Powerblade • Scorpion's Claw • Singing Spear • Triskele • Witchblade • Witch Staff • Star Glaive
Isha's Lament (Novella)	Isha's Lament is a novella by Thomas Parrott. The Blackstone Fortress is a haven for those seeking fame, glory and power amongst the horrors of the galaxy. To many, it is a treasure trove beyond imagination, to others, it is an escape from their past, a chance to put their skills to use on the edge of the galaxy far from prying eyes. Brakus Andradus is the latter. A former sniper in the Astra Militarum, now a deserter aiming to drown his memories, Brakus stumbles from job to job. But, after a deadly plague breaks out following his last expedition and threatens to wipe out the denizens of Precipice, the sniper is forced back into the Fortress in search of a cure, with only the slimmest hope of finding one.
Eldar Titan	Eldar Titans are mechanical, humanoid-shaped war engines of the Eldar similar to the Titans of other races. Built with more of an eye towards grace and beauty than functionality, these tall, slim constructs are more agile and faster than the lumbering behemoths of the Imperium.[2a][2b] Eldar Titans are constructed around a Wraithbone core, a specialised psycho-reactive substance which, among other benefits, allow the souls of departed Eldar to inhabit the Titans. Moving freely throughout the construct, these spirits give each Titan a consciousness of its own, which merges with that of its crew to create one sentience. The crew of a Titan, also known as Steersmen,[2b] also differ greatly from those of the lesser races. They are twins or triplets, a rare and reverend occurrence given the Eldar's low birth rate, who are raised with their Titans from birth. In the case of smaller Titans each sibling will occupy a different machine,[2a] while larger Titans will utilize a full set. The natural emotional bonds between each sibling, combined with their latent psychic potential and the special relationship between crew, Titan, and spirits, allows for a tremendous degree of control when operating these towering constructs. The most sorrowful, yet most skilful, of these pairings is when the soul of a deceased kin is interred within a Titan's wraithbone shell. Their still-living siblings will seldom leave the machine, preferring instead to remain inside and commune with the departed.
Commorragh	Commorragh, also known as the Dark City is the capital of the Dark Eldar society. It's located deep within the labyrinth of the Webway, the space between realspace and the Warp.[1a] The origins of Commoragh are traced to the times of the ancient Eldar empire when it was dominant in the galaxy where it became one of the greatest Webway port-cities.[1a] Port Commoragh was established in M18 as the primary nodal port in the Webway.[1c] This allowed it the capacity to transport a fleet to any of the most vital planets of the Eldar. Its ability to access the far-flung corners of realspace led it to becoming the most important location in the entire Webway. Thus, it was considered too valuable to belong to any one aspect of the Eldar empire and was granted autonomy. However, this meant that Commoragh became outside the jurisdiction of the great Eldar councils of the time and thus attracted many to the port-city who wished to hide their deeds. In time, this realm expanded with wealth and influence reaching across its borders leading it to absorb other locations within the Webway such as port-cities, private estates and sub-realms. With each expansion, Commoragh grew even larger and more impressive as it fed upon the plundered wealth of these parts of the Webway.[1a] By M31, the Fall of the Eldar fell upon their empire which shattered their civilization forever. The unrepentant Eldar that survive this event continue to survive within the Webway between M31 to M32 that sees Commoragh become a vast realm itself and the Dark City coming under the oppressive rule of the noble houses that lurk within its heart.[1c] Commorragh has stood for over ten millennia, and due to the difficulties of surviving the Dark Eldar way of life, combined with needing to live much longer than what is considered possible for normal Eldar, there is only one being who could possibly remember the founding first-hand: Asdrubael Vect, Supreme Lord of the Kabal of the Black Heart. In fact, Vect claims that he is the founder of Commorragh, as well as the one who discovered the way of extracting souls from living creatures in order to prolong one's life. Unfortunately, he is the only one nearly ancient enough to know whether these statements are true or false, so the validity of this claim is unknown. But it seems that by M35, Vect had achieved total dominance over Commorragh following the Imperium's raid on the city that virtually wiped out the old aristocracy.[1a]
Dominion ­Genesis	The Dominion ­Genesis, or Turellea Dandramensha in Aeldari,[2a] was a massive type of starship that was used by the Eldar Empire, to create Maiden Worlds. It is not known what became of the Dominions, following the Fall of the Eldar. The Eldar saw Dominion Genesis as their tool, god-given by Vaul the Maker, and used it to make a garden of the galaxy.[2a] In the crudest terms, the Genesis vessel resembled a fat-bellied, many limbed arachnid. Its centre was a vast disc, studded with domes and etched with valleys. From this central body, equal in scale to a continental shelf of the world below, dozens of ivory arms projected for thousands of miles. Between each limb were stretched gossamer-thin sails that reflected the starlight in a glittering fan of golden threads. The underside of each limb emanated a scarlet light, evidently breathing the transmuting Genesis phenomena down onto the planet below. The arms of the massive craft curled inwards, as though holding the half-made world in an unseen grip.[2b] - Lord Explorator Satavic Yuel's thoughts upon first encountering a Dominion Genesis vessel.[2b]
Exodite World	Exodite Worlds are those that were settled by Eldar, commonly known as Exodites, fleeing the increasing depravity of the majority of the Eldar race just prior to the Fall of the Eldar. They are wild planets, often untamed and dangerous.[1a] Craftworld Biel-Tan are known to be defenders of Exodite worlds, as they see the Exodites as the first stage in regaining the Eldar empire. Exodite worlds would be their staging grounds, and they guard each world jealously, slaughtering any who seek to take the worlds for themselves.[1b] Often, Exodite worlds are home to vast herds of megadons, or dragons to the Eldar. It is likely that early settlers spread these animals, much like humanity spread the Grox throughout their realm.[1a] Exodites live nomadic lives, following the megadon herds across huge grassy plains. They have eschewed the use of much of their former technology, but still remain able to use anything that could be used on a Craftworld. They simply choose to live as they do, rather than having 'degenerated', as many Imperial citizens believe.[1a]
Flip belt	A Flip Belt (Eldar, geirgilath or "belt of speed"[Needs Citation]) is an anti-gravity belt used by the Harlequins. Flip Belts are suspensor, or anti-gravity, belts which triggered by mental command of its wearer and allow him or her to pivot effortlessly at hip level, as well as increasing the Harlequins' already considerable agility. A short range negative gravity field is generated, allowing the Harlequin to use their already prodigious acrobatic talent to greater effect, bounding across battlefields and performing killing blows that are too fast and complicated to be blocked by enemies in combat. Only the most towering obstacles can interfere the movement of the Harlequin with the activated Flip Belt. This article needs work on its citations.For help on citation see the citation guidelines. You can help Lexicanum by fixing it.
Webway	The Webway is a labyrinthine dimension utilised by the Eldar for faster-than-light travel. This realm's origins are traced to the ancient race known as the Old Ones as a conduit through which they could travel to countless far-flung worlds without suffering from the risk of the tides of the Warp.[2c] It became a tool of this species when they became the first race to cross the vast gulf of stars in a single step and learnt to manipulate alternate dimensions. This quickly led them to attaining a mastery over the use of Webway Portals. It would later be used as a way for the Old Ones to outmanoeuver the Necrontyr during the War in Heaven leading to that race being turned into a minor irritant in the span of a few centuries.[1a] This ultimately changed when the C'tan entered into the war on the side of the now metallic Necron armies. By the closing days of the War in Heaven, one of the C'tan known as Nyadra'zatha had long desired to bring his eldtrich fire into the Webway. The Burning One taught the Necrons how to pierce the boundary of that space beyond space by way of Dolmen Gates whereupon they turned the Old Ones' greatest weapon against them.[1b] In time, knowledge of the Webway would pass to the Eldar where the technologies used to create it were once taught to them by the Old Ones.[5a] These secret, invisible passageways between the Warp are noted as being ancient constructs and are older than even the Eldar know. The ancient Eldar discovered that it was possible to move through within its threads.[2c] From the many secrets of the Warp taught to them by the Old Ones, the Eldar created a pan-galactic network of navigable tunnels. It was the ancient Eldar who mastered the original Webway network.[2c] At the height of their empire, they used it to travel thousands of light years safely yet quickly and linked all their worlds. Their starships were thus able to move from one end of the galaxy to the other without entering realspace. By M18, the Eldar empire established Commoragh as its primary nodal port within the Webway.[2d] In this age, the leaders of the excess cults are known to have relocated their power bases into the Webway where they could command entire sub-realms.[2a] This pattern of behaviour continued between M25 to M30.[2d]
Craftworld	Craftworlds are vast craft populated by Eldar and home to the Asuryani, the greater remnant of the Eldar race after the Fall of their civilisation. Each Craftworld is a self-sufficient, independent realm with its own culture and is capable of housing tens of millions. Craftworlds were, during the Eldar Empire, trading vessels and they travel through the void of space at sub-light speeds. Since the Fall the original ships have grown considerably in size, now ten or a hundred times larger than the vessels at their cores. Craftworlds are in many ways living entities, powered by psychic energy from its Infinity Circuit and responding in an organic way to the stimuli of its residen Eldar's psychic forces. Each Craftworld is a self-contained bio-system with zones that contains forests and other natural flora, acting as green lungs to furnish the breathable atmostphere and provide renewable resources for the Eldar. Craftworlds contain vast space docks, often housing fleets which carry Eldar armies through the Webway to the rest of the galaxy. The power within a Craftworld can be expended as light or heat, and most Craftworld technology could not function without this psychic power grid. Prior to the Fall, Craftworlds were vast trading ships, effectively whole self-contained communities housing hundreds of Eldar families. Trading missions could take the Craftworlds thousands of light years beyond Eldar civilisation, separating the community from its homeworld for centuries. This meant the Craftworld communities had already developed a strong sense of independence and self-reliance, so they remained mostly separate from the increasing decadence of their species. Because a Craftworld might return to the rest of Eldar civilisation only three or four times in a thousand years, it was easy for them to see the degeneration of Eldar society, while to the Eldar as a whole the slow corruption was too gradual to recognise.[1a]
Kaelor	Kaelor is an extremely isolated Craftworld of the Eldar. Under unclear circumstances, at some point in the distant past Kaelor made a webway jump to the edge of the galaxy and has not ventured back towards the galactic centre for several millennia. It has virtually no contact with the outside galaxy, and even the Harlequins barely remember its existence. Kaelor is known to pass through the Calixis Sector, a region normally avoided by the Eldar, every thousand years. The Craftworld of Kaelor remembers virtually nothing of its early history and its earliest known history begins with the Craftwars, and even information of that event is very scarce. What is known is that following a webway jump, Kaelor found itself on a collision course with Saim-Hann. The ensuing conflict supposedly ended with a Kaelorian victory, but this is highly doubtful. All that is known is that Kaelor was virtually rent apart and is now only held together through incredibly strong psychic bonds. During this time, an individual, known only as "Gwrih the Radiant", came to prominence. Gwrih united the Craftworld in an uneasy peace that has held for millennia; a single line, the Rivalin Dynasty, was chosen to hold the position of Farseer. The other "Great families" were effectively exiled from the capital city, the "Sentrium", to the outer reaches of the Craftworld. The heads of the Aspect temples are accorded far less stature on Kaelor than other Craftworlds and swore an oath to Gwrih that they would never intervene in the political struggles of the Great houses.
Aspect Warrior	The Asurya or Aspect Warriors form the main military strength of the Eldar armies. These Eldar have chosen to walk the Path of the Warrior. Once an Eldar has chosen to tread this path they join an Aspect Shrine, a group of warriors dedicated to one Aspect. There, Exarchs train them in a specific aspect of warfare. Each Warrior Aspect represents a facet of the Eldar war god, Kaela Mensha Khaine, and thus embodies a specific aspect of Eldar warfare. Each shrine was founded millennia ago by a single Phoenix Lord. It is impossible to say how many different Aspects there are. The most common Aspects have shrines on most Craftworlds, while some Aspects are unique to a particular Craftworld - such as the weirdly terrifying Slicing Orbs of Zandros, which are confined to a single shrine on a single craftworld. There are dozens[10a] of aspects of Khaine, the Lord of Murder many of which go unnamed.
Harlequin's Kiss	The Harlequin's Kiss (Eldar: brathu-angau, translated "kiss of doom" or "kiss of evil") also known as Sting, is a tubular wrist-mounted Monofilament Injector. As the name suggests it is widely associated with the Eldar Harlequins. The Kiss is only effective in close combat. It contains a tightly-coiled retractable monofilament wire which is around 100 metres in length. When activated (often with a forward punching motion) the wire is violently released. Capable of piercing armour, if the wire penetrates its victim it instantly uncoils and lashes around violently, liquefying bones and internal organs, and causing immediate death. The wire then retracts back into the Kiss.
Shuriken Cannon	The Shuriken Cannon is a heavy class of Eldar Shuriken Weapon. The Shuriken Cannon is a much larger version of the shuriken catapult. While it works in a similar way to smaller shuriken weaponry, it includes a number of additional features, such as an elongated ammunition coil, a triple accelerator field, and a stabilizing gyroscopes. They are generally mounted on Guardian Grav Platforms and Eldar vehicles.[1a] Dark Reaper with Shuriken Cannon
Inquisition War Trilogy (Novel Series)	The Inquisition War is an omnibus of three novels written by Ian Watson and set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe. It was first published in 2004. Cover art is by Clint Langley. Of the three Inquisition War series novels, the first, Draco, is the earliest Warhammer 40k novel - having been originally published in 1990 as Inquisitor.[Needs Citation] All three books, the other two being Harlequin and Chaos Child, feature the Inquisitor Jaq Draco and his retinue. Draco himself was an Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus.[Needs Citation] Inquisitor Jaq Draco was born on Xerxes Quintus, a planet rife with mutants and psykers. It had only recently been rediscovered and unified within the Imperium. Draco's parents were Imperial adepts sent to the planet. After they were killed he was raised as an orphan in a missionary school on the planet. Draco was discovered to be a psyker; when a Black Ship arrived he was taken and brought to Terra. He was one of the very few aboard the Black Ship judged to be psychically powerful enough to be allowed to live and go on to become an Inquisitor.[Needs Citation]
Meh'Lindi	Meh'Lindi was an Imperial Assassin of the Callidus Temple who was chosen as the subject for a unique experiment by her Clade for the purposes of infiltrating Genestealer Cults. Meh'Lindi was born Lindi to a barbarian tribe on a Feral World before being recruited by the Officio Assassinorum and trained over the course of a decade. Despite the efforts of her handlers to have her discard her old identity, she stubbornly tried to hold onto her birth name, proclaiming "Me, Lindi! Me, Lindi!" (partly due to her lack of skill with Gothic). This led to her instructors calling her Meh'Lindi. Prior to her selection for the procedure, Meh'Lindi was regarded as one of the Temple's finest infiltrators. She had even managed to disguise herself as an Eldar well enough to fool another Eldar.

Wraithknight	Wraithknights are colossal Eldar Wraithbone constructs. While gigantic and heavily armed with a mixture of mighty Heavy Wraithcannons, Suncannons, Ghostglaives, Scattershields, and other heavy weapons, the Wraithknight's advanced design still allows it to be nimble enough to run through the ruin of a scattered city. The shell of a Wraithknight houses the spirits of the dead in much the same way as the Wraithlord and Wraithguard. However, Wraithknights differ from their lesser cousins, as they also hold a living Eldar pilot within. These pilots are rare and unusual warriors who were each born a twin. The psychic link between an Eldar and their twin is like no other, and this bond allows them to sense the proximity, mood, and even thoughts of their counterpart. If the twin were to die, the surviving brother or sister will often fade away in sympathy. Sometimes, when such a division takes place, the surviving twin will sacrifice what is left of his life to pilot a Wraithknight. The essence of the dead twin is transferred into a Spirit Stone attached to the machine, whilst the surviving sibling is put into a near-permanent trance within his cockpit. The clarity of thought provided by the living twin ensures that the construct moves with the speed typical of a living Eldar, while the psychic link of the departed sibling allows him to commune with the animating forces of his twin, but also spirits of former pilots of the construct. The great measure of control afforded by this mind gives the pilot mastery over the Wraithknights psychically-powered weapons systems and an acrobatic grace that seemingly defies its size.
Troupe	Troupers, also called Rilletann, are the most numerous Harlequin warriors. The main body of any company of Harlequins will be troupers, who perform as the chorus on both the stage and battlefield. They choose a Light, Twilight, or Dark role, and are led by a Troupe Master, Each Harlequin belongs to one of three type of Troupes:[3b] Every Trouper wears a mask to conceals their identity while evoking the character whose role they play. A Harlequin’s mask can change its features by the moment, displaying shifting features to aid their performance. In battle, those who look into the mask of a Trouper see their worst fears reflected back at them, an inescapable psychoresponsive bombardment that distracts and terrifies in equal measure.[3a]
Kabal of the Broken Sigil	The Kabal of the Broken Sigil is one of the great Kabals found in the High Commorragh. They can date their origin back to the days of The Fall.[1a] The Kabal takes its icon from the ancient Eldar glyph Drethuchii, loosely translated as the Shattering of Harmony. Like its namesake, the Kabal is infamous for its acts of discord. Whenever order and prosperity abound, the Broken Sigil will bring confusion and despair to even the most idyllic places in the galaxy. Terror tactics are much beloved by its Kabalites, so much so that Archon Xerathis is looked down upon his rivals for the "predictability" of his strategies. They are known to engage in sky-writing, blanket-bombing with hallucinogenic gas and hijacking communications channels to ensure their victims are frightened half to death before their invasion even begins, the better to prepare a rich feast of fear from their victims.
Dark Eldar	The Drukhari or Dark Eldar are kindred to the Asuryani and other Aeldari, an ancient and advanced race of elf-like humanoids. Their armies usually have the advantages of speed and technology, though they are often lacking in resilience and numbers. The Dark Eldar revel in piracy, enslavement and torture, and are sadistic in the extreme. Dark Eldar raiding parties make use of advanced anti-gravity skimmers to launch high speed raids on their enemy while still transporting a large number of their warriors. Due to their use of the galaxy-spanning inter-dimensional labyrinth known as the Webway, they are extremely mobile, striking from seemingly nowhere, with little or no warning, and vanishing with their captives before significant military reaction can be mobilised.[1a][1b] The Dark Eldar are unique amongst the races in the sense that they do not occupy many planets, but rather one dark city called Commorragh. They are mainly pirates, though are sometimes used as mercenaries.[1a][1b] Asdrubael Vect is the supreme overlord of the dark city of Commorragh and of the Dark Eldar as a whole. The term "Dark Eldar" also comes from him, being the first one to openly refer himself with "Eladrith Ynneas" in M32.[1c]
Bonesinger	This article or article section is based on information from a Fanatic Press publication such as Fanatic Magazine or one of its predecessors (e.g. The Citadel Journal, Necromunda Magazine, etc.). These publications regularly featured articles submitted by hobbyists, and as such, their content may or may not be in contradiction to established background lore. Bonesingers are the Paths by which members of the Eldar race are able to master their innate abilities to psychomorphically manipulate Wraithbone. Bonesingers are tasked with the construction and maintenance of Eldar structures and machinery. They do this through the psychic manipulation of Wraithbone, shaping and moulding it into various items. While Wraithbone naturally repairs itself, the process can be accelerated by the psychic abilities of a Bonesinger.
High Commorragh	High Commorragh is a region of Commorragh, home of the Dark Eldar. Consisting of the highest spires of the Dark City, they are home to the elites of Dark Eldar society: Archons, Dracons, famed warriors, and other figures of social status. Many of the spires possess thousand-foot idols of Kabalite warlords. A place of great luxury and status for the ruling class, the citizens of High Commorragh consider themselves blessed. They have a great distaste towards those who live in other regions of the city, such as Low Commorragh and the Old City. The denizens of High Commorragh dub these areas Ynnealidh, or the "Necropolis below".
Swooping Hawk	The Swooping Hawks are a type of Aspect Warrior, Eldar who fight according to one of the aspects of Kaela Mensha Khaine. The Swooping Hawks take their name from the wild hunting birds of Eldar mythology that symbolize revenge and retribution. Just as the birds of legend contain the spirit of a murdered Eldar, hovering over their killers as a mark of guilt, so too do the Swooping Hawks fly across the battlefield, dealing swift death to their enemies.[1a][2a][3a] The Swooping Hawks were founded by Baharroth, the Winged Phoenix, said to be the finest student of Asurmen. Like the other Phoenix Lords he is as old as The Fall itself, but it is foretold he will die his final death during the Rhana Dandra, the last battle against Chaos.[2b] Of all the Aspect Shrines the Swooping Hawks are among the most mobile, thanks to their Swooping Hawk Wings, which allow them to lift off into the air at a moment's notice and fly across the battlefield. The speed and agility this gives the Swooping Hawks more than makes up for the fact that their Aspect Armour, compared to that worn by other Shrines, is thinner and offers less protection.[1a][3a] The armour is typically coloured like the sky, such as a pale blue or grey, with contrasting colours as well, especially on the wings.[1a] The ritual weapons of the Swooping Hawks are the Lasblaster and Swooping Hawk Grenade Pack, two weapons especially suited to their role as harassers operating ahead of the main Eldar host. The grenade pack in particular can carry a wide variety of grenades, from Krak and Frag to Plasma and Haywire Grenades. Flying over their enemies' heads, the Swooping Hawks rain down explosive death before closing in to press the assault or falling back to cover to use their Lasblasters.[1a][3a]
Alaitoc	Alaitoc is an Eldar Craftworld known for its extensive use of Rangers. Related to this is the fact that Alaitoc is also a highly ordered Craftworld; many individuals choose instead the Path of the Outcast, becoming Rangers. While all Craftworlds make use of the highly efficient sniper Rangers, none field or produce more than Alaitoc. By their nature, Alaitoc Rangers, known as the Starstriders[6a], do not reside upon the Craftworld, but travel the galaxy. These rangers retain their loyalty to Alaitoc, only returning to their Craftworld on occasion. Aside from the regular Rangers, Alaitoc is also the only Craftworld to field the highly skilled Rangers known as Pathfinders. These highly trained snipers can cause havoc to the enemy. In times of need the Craftworld sometimes recalls their Rangers to contribute to Alaitoc's forces. Alaitoc can also call upon an unusually high number of Exarchs, as its Eldar are known to become utterly consumed by their chosen Path. This, however, causes many of its citizens to sate their extreme desires by becoming Outcasts, making Alaitoc closely connected to Eldar Corsairs throughout the Galaxy.[6a] Alaitoc's symbol depicts the Sword of Khaine bisecting the Red Moon, the sigil of the House of Eldanesh, referencing the War Gods slaying of the Eldar hero.[6a]
Path	Paths are a societal organisation of Craftworld Eldar. After the Fall of the Eldar those Eldar who had managed to save themselves upon the Craftworlds underwent a complete social reform. Their lives would no longer spent in pursuit of their wishes, pleasures, and wanton natures. This had led to the Fall, and the creation of Slaanesh. Instead each individual Eldar chooses for himself a discipline, a Path or 'Ai’elethra and will focus himself upon it. This path will be studied, practiced, and eventually mastered. Then the Eldar chooses a new path and the process will begin anew. Each new role does not completely replace the previous, but merely adds to the Eldar's accumulated experience. As Eldar pass through these different roles they explore the many aspects of their own character. An Eldar of a thousand years or more will usually have experienced many different roles and attained a very sophisticated understanding of the universe.
Shrieker Cannon	The Shrieker Cannon (or Buanna in the Eldar Language) is a weapon used by Eldar Harlequins. The Shuriken Shrieker Cannon is specialized version of the Shuriken Cannon used by Harlequin Death Jesters. In addition to a longer barrel, the Shriker Cannon can fire both normal shurikens and shrieker shurikens, also known as margrech, which are hollowed out and contain a genetically tailored enzyme-based toxin. Centripetal forces created by the spinning of the disc forces this virulent toxin into the target through microscopic pores in the shuriken's spines, which also give it a distinctive shrieking noise as it travels through the air. The result of the toxin is most unpleasant to any living creature: combining with their own genetic material, the unfortunate target's tissue begins to twist and distort itself, organs cease functioning, and delirium sets in as the serum reaches their brain. Eventually the replicating genetic serum reaches a fever pitch, and the target violently explodes in a most horrific and untidy manner. The Shrieker Cannon is also outfitted with a Jester's Blade for close quarter combat.
Vaul	Vaul, also known as the Master Smith and the Creator, was the Eldar God of craft and industry. He was brother to the Phoenix King Asuryan, and uncle to Kurnous and Isha. He gave the Eldar inventiveness, which the aeldari artisans and bonesingers have used to forge wondrous creations, from the glittering structures, imposing statues, and sparkling forests that sprout from a craftworld's wraithbone core to fortress-shattering Engines of Vaul. This deity was acclaimed to be a craftsman without peer and it was said that he was without morality with his singular purpose being beauty rather than truth. After the Phoenix King Asuryan banished the Eldar from the Heavenly Realms to the Mortal Lands, both Kurnous and Isha came to their uncle Vaul as they were both dismayed for being separated from their children. Thus, they asked Vaul to aid them in finding a means to regain contact with their offspring and, according to legend, the Smith God took the tears of Isha, from which he fashioned the first Spirit stones. Through such a means, the Eldar were able to communicate with their gods despite being separated from one another and though Asuryan had banished them. Vaul gave one of the spirit stones to Isha whilst the rest were given to her children so that they could speak to one another in secret. Through these secret exchanges, the Eldar learnt how to use runes and create skeletal structures from Wraithbone.[1a] However, Kaela Mensha Khaine one day overheard Isha talking through the stone to the Eldar and informed Asuryan himself who was enraged that his command was broken. To punish the perpetrators, he had Kurnous and Isha given over to Khaine to do with as he pleased. But Vaul could not see any harm done to them and thus struck a bargain with the War God who agreed to release the pair in exchange for a thousand enchanted blades within a year's time. The Smith God worked long and hard, he managed to forge all the blades except the last one that lay unfinished on his anvil. In order to trick Khaine, Vaul substituted the last blade with a mortal one, which he delivered to the War God who released his two captives, whereupon the three departed. Khaine was quick to discover the subterfuge and cried out in rage where he called the Smith God a cheat whilst vowing revenge.[1a]
Ork Clan	Ork Clans are cultural groupings of Orks rather than actual communities, each embodying a distinct Orkish philosophy. Clans exist outside the organization of tribes - where tribes are inconstant, breaking apart and reforming in war, Clans are constant and enduring. There are countless tribes and warbands throughout the galaxy, but only six significant Clans. Each has its own distinct character, culture, colours, markings, and ways of waging war. The Clan distinctions are possibly genetic, engineered into the Orks by the Brainboys of the distant past.
Mekboy	"Da best shoota I eva made, dat iz. Loadza barrulz, so dat it’s ded shooty. ‘Sept dat wun, ‘cos dat’s da skorcha, dat’s burny insted. Yeah, good an’ propa.

Meks are the spiritual leaders of Ork society, as they are at the heart of the spontaneous psychic event know as the Waa-Ork, which sees the psychic energy of the Ork race manifest trough the building of great war machines, and a subsequent military rampage trough the galaxy.[1c]
Ghazghkull Mag Uruk Thraka	"Some Orks are clever. Some Orks are strong. I'm both"[12b] "Humies is all weak scum that deserve ta get stomped. 'Cept for One-Eye Yarrick. He knows how ter fight." Ghazghkull Mag Uruk Thraka, the self-proclaimed Prophet of the Waaagh!, known in the Imperium as The Beast of Armageddon, is the Ork Warlord of Waaagh! Ghazghkull and currently the most notorious Warboss of the 41st Millennium. He is infamous for his actions during both the Second and Third Armageddon Wars. Ghazghkull is a particularly megalomaniacal Ork, convinced he is blessed by the Ork gods Gork and Mork. He possesses a considerable measure of cunning, and in battle he tends to focus more on commanding his troops compared to other Warbosses, only engaging in combat himself at critical moments. Ghazghkull Mag Uruk Thraka roughly translates into "Metal-skull big/great Ork ruler" in Low Gothic.
Human	Humans are one of the primary races in the galaxy, and the one from whose point of view the vast majority of the background is written. In M41 the majority of humans are part of the Imperium of Man, although other human civilisations are known to exist. Originally little more than tree-beasts, humans originated from the planet Terra and while one with their ecosystem had no greater role defined for them by the Old Ones, an ancient and powerful race that ruled the Galaxy in its infancy. However, following the destruction of the Old Ones in the War in Heaven, humans went on to develop in unforeseen and uncontrolled ways as raw uncontrolled evolution took hold. Eventually humans went on to colonize the galaxy during the Dark Age of Technology. Almost nothing is known about human civilisation in this time, having been lost in the chaos of the Age of Strife. Most of Humanity's shattered colonies were reunified by the Emperor during the Great Crusade, becoming the early Imperium. The recorded history of Humanity can be divided into roughly four periods:
Grot Rigger	Grot Riggers are Gretchin slaves who assist in the operation and movement of Ork vehicles. They allow an immobilised vehicle to start moving again, be it by them pushing the vehicle itself or by them fixing it somehow.

Tau	The T'au (or Tau) are a young race of technologically-oriented beings from the Eastern Fringe and the dominant species of the T'au Empire.[1a] T'au, the T'au home planet, was discovered in 789.M35 by the Adeptus Mechanicus Explorator Fleet ship Land's Vision. Adeptus Mechanicus records indicate that at that time, the T'au species had mastered the use of simple tools and weapons, as well as fire. Before the planet could be cleansed and colonised by the Imperium, however, a violent Warp-storm erupted around the planet. The outbreak of the wars of the Age of Apostasy shortly thereafter preempted any further Imperial follow-up and the then-minor xenos race was effectively forgotten by humanity outside a few Explorator records.[10a] It would be another six-thousand years before the Imperium had any further contact with the T'au, when an unknown class of alien vessel was encountered by system defense ships at Devlan in the Ultima Segmentum. After failing to respond to naval challenges, the ship was attacked and destroyed. Bodies recovered from the wreckage were a close match to the records from the Land's Vision. The rapid elevation from a primitive species on a single planet to a starfaring power in only six millennia represented a new danger to Imperial interests, especially as some of the Human worlds on the fringes of Imperial territory were discovered to already have trade relations with the T'au. Almost a century later, the Damocles Crusade smashed into T'au space, bringing the two powers into war.[10c]
Squat	Kin, also known by the Imperial pejorative of Squats or Homo Sapien Rotundus, are an abhuman species predominately found in the galactic core. They exist in a variety of civilizations, most notably the Leagues of Votann[1a], but also including the Ironhead Prospectors of Necromunda. As abhumans, kin (as they refer to themselves) share a common origin with that of humanity, having almost certainly originated from pre-Imperial Terra in the ancient past. It is said that during this time, mining explorers and settlers known as the First Ancestors set out for the Galactic Core in Generation Ships from what was almost certainly pre-Imperial Terra. Seeking its great wealth, these fleets left with highly advanced Artificial Intelligences known as Votann Ancestor Cores in order to provide them with all the wisdom and aid they would require in their mission.[1a] Thanks to their advanced cloneskein technology, the kin were rapidly able to adapt to the conditions of the galactic core, creating a race physically stronger and more robust than that of a standard human, as well as more resistant to the mutating powers of the Warp. As the fleets settled within the Core Holds soon sprang up and the burgeoning civilization reaped the immense wealth of their new home. Soon enough, a mercantile confederation dubbed the Leagues of Votann formed, and it spent the long millennia settling the immense sprawl of the core and exploiting its boundless riches.[1a]
Evil Sunz	The Evil Sunz are one of the six major Ork Clans, their most notable characteristic is their love of fast vehicles (or "jalopies"). Their symbol is a red sun with a grimacing face, often with yellow or orange flames. The Evil Sunz love loud, rumbling engines, the smell of gasoline, and above all, going as fast as Orkily possible - arguably even more than splitting heads (of course, going as fast as Orkily possible while splitting heads is a dream fulfilled). Usually, an Evil Sunz band will consist almost entirely of Speed Kult members. Even warbands that haven't given completely over to their love of speed will often have many bikes or vehicles in their force. The clan also contains more Mekboyz than most, and therefore they often field more mechanical creations than other clanz. What little footsloggers they do have are saving up their teeth for a good bike, or perhaps a group of Ork mates are pooling in for a flash truck. Most vehicles of the Evil Sunz are painted red with flames down the side to tie in with their main belief that "Da red wunz go fasta!" Often, the Evil Sunz are envied by the slogging footboyz of other klanz for their ability to get into the battle quickly, especially the highly mobile Trukkers, who charge into the fray aboard a large and shoddy Wartrukk that is poorly armoured but blindingly fast, as well as having big shootas. Warbikers in this klan are the best of all the other Orky bikers, often refitting their hull-mounted dakkagunz with menacing mega-blastaz. Their horridly crude engines deliver a sickening plume of smoke wherever they travel, granting them cover.
Ork Quotes	This article collects all famous quotes made about or by Orks and/or Gretchin. The quotes are organized in alphabetical order using the author's name. divide, conquer and count da bodies when we done. WAAAGH! I'm da profit of da Waaagh an' whole worlds burn in my boot prints.

Ork Domains	"There are beasts among the stars, beasts that would crush our lives, make ash of our worlds and break all that we hold sacred. The beasts wait in the dark and shunned reaches like the things glimpsed in the forests of old, things that looked out with red, shining eyes and hearts filled with the joy of ruin."- from Remarks on the Nature on the Unknown by Estivan Mauritin, advisor to Rogue Trader Hiram Sult. The Orks are the most widespread of the sentient races, inhabiting worlds across the whole of the known galaxy, and probably throughout the whole universe. There are Ork realms, Ork Empires and untold numbers of isolated Ork Worlds. Wherever humanity may travel in the universe, there are Orks. The universe is Orkdom, the domain of Orks, and the Eldar say that the Orks have become part of reality itself. Very little is known about the beginning of Ork expansion. It occurs sporadically, giving them an entirely random pattern of settlement through the galaxy. Their main way of expansion is known as Waaagh! — combination of mass-scale migration and holy war through which Orks have managed to get hold on innumerable worlds all over the galaxy. Their expansion is aided by their natural toughness, allowing them to survive in the harshest of conditions and colonise very inhospitable worlds. Particularly successful Waaaghs! capture great swathes of space, resulting in creation of Ork Empires. These are not connected to each other and despite their control over a significant part of known space, Ork Domains are not a united or cohesive organisation - rather they are a collection of thousands of individual territories and empires. These independent factions are as likely to fight with each other as they are with any other species which are sometimes even hard to find in Ork-controlled territories. Due to specifics of Orkoid reproduction, Ork-controlled planets are very hard to recapture and even failed Ork invasions allow them to get hold on the planet. It is widely known that once the world has seen the war with Orks, it is never free from it again as new generations of Feral Orks grow in distant corners to begin new years of bloody conflicts and giving birth to even more Orks.
List of Ork Oddboyz	This article lists all known Ork Oddboyz.
Ion Weapon	Electric (Arc • Tesla) • Flame • Gauss • Graviton • Grenade • Ion/Plasma • Laser • Melta • Missile • Bolt • Ordnance • Projectile • Grenade launcher • Monofilament/Web • Sonic • Volkite Chain • Force • Electric (Arc • Taser) • Power • Miscellaneous Ion Weapons are advanced Tau and Leagues of Votann weapons that fire high-energy streams of ions at a target. These streams can vaporize flesh and metal with equal ease. Tau Ion weapons can be overcharged to generate a devastating attack, but doing so risks overheating its primary power cell.
Vash'ya	Vash'ya is a Sept of the Tau Empire established during the Second Sphere of Expansion.[1a] The sept world of Vash'ya was settled near the end of the Second Sphere Expansion, with the Earth caste machines needing a long time to make the air breathable, making it known as the world 'between spheres'. The sept world provided a majority of Air caste ship crews and pilots for the earlier expansions. Because of this, the Air caste has a long tradition here. Many defence platforms and major Air caste fleets dock near the sept world.[1a] Sometime after the Second Agrellan Campaign, Vash'ya was invaded by a force of Hrud. The Tau countered the aliens' entropic time fields with Drones and remotely operated Battlesuits, delivering a victory for the Empire after a fierce battle.
Kir'qath Class Starship	The Kir'qath (or Defender) is an Escort vessel, and for a time was the only true Escort in the Kor'vattra. The Kir'qath is unusual for an escort in that it is quite slow and not as manoeuvrable as the Imperial Sword Class Frigate that inspired it. It possesses greater firepower than a Sword Class, however, being equipped with both a multi-arc railgun battery and a respectable torpedo salvo. Profile
Jagordian	The Jagordian are a sentient Xenos species, who have joined the Tau Empire. They were convinced to do so by the legendary Ethereal Aun'Wei, after he introduced them to the Greater Good. In thanks for doing this, the Jagordian's technisists created the Sceptre of Unity for him. Ethereal • Air • Earth • Fire • Water
Vorgh (Xenos Species)	The Vorgh are a massive sentient Xenos species who have joined the Tau Empire. Despite their size, they are peaceful until they are roused to anger. Then the Vorgh's size and resiliency allows them to prevail over even a super-heavy combat walker. Ethereal • Air • Earth • Fire • Water
Altar of Maws (Short Story)	"Altar of Maws" is a short story by Peter Fehervari, originally released in a Black Library eShorts week subscription in May 2023. On Phaedra, battling armies of waterborne T'au and Imperials unwittingly disturb a monstrous Chaos creature that has slumbered for centuries.
Team (Tau)	A Team (Tau: La'Rua) is the smallest military unit of the Tau Fire Caste, equivalent to an Imperial Guard Squad. The most common type of Team consists of Fire Warriors, anywhere from six to twelve Shas'la led by a Shas'ui, but all Tau military units are organized into teams of various sizes. In addition to these normal line units are special Teams known as Mission Groups, more analgous to Imperial Kill-Teams, which are purpose-built for specific assignments and commanded from the Coalition level.
Earth Caste	The Earth Caste (or Fio) is one of the five Castes of Tau Society, based around engineering, agriculture, industry, and construction.[1a] This caste provides for the manufacturing, agricultural, industrial, artisans, and engineering needs of the Tau Empire. By far the largest caste in sheer numbers, it is they who erect dwellings, provide food, and produce new technology. Members of the Earth Caste are often described as plain and dour, possessing a rather stoic outlook on life in general. They were originally the first Tau to build cities and practice agriculture. The city of Fio'taun is an example of this, being the first place where the Ethereals appeared.[1a] Most of the simple labor of the Earth Caste is done by Drones.
Kass'l Class Gunship	The Kass'l Class Gunship is a class of Tau Empire warship. Also called the Orca gunship, the Kass'l is a much more nimble vessel compared to the Kor'vattra's other mainline escort, the Kir'qath. Equipped with both Railgun Batteries and Ion Cannons, its only pitfall is that it lacks its own Gravitic Drive, the Tau being unable to manufacture them on such a compact scale. Instead, they are transported via the Gravitic Hooks of larger vessels. Profile
D'yanoi	D'yanoi is a sept world that was once isolated from the Tau Empire for many years. The planet of Vespid is only 3 light years to the galactic south of the D'yanoi sept. As a result, D'yanoi Hunter Cadres are frequently accompanied by Vespid allies. D'yanoi, whose name means "twin moons", was isolated from the main body of the Tau Empire for many years due to a fierce and unnatural space storm; this isolation led the sept to regress to a lower level of technological advancement. Although contact with D'yanoi has since been re-established, its inhabitants are still considered backwards and rustic by most Tau. The Sept has also seen many infamous Ork invasions, though its warriors have defeated each in turn, despite the horrors wrought by the greenskins. In particular, the actions of the veteran Broadside Battlesuit pilot Shas'ui Calon'oi when fighting the Orks have earned him the moniker of "Wavebreaker."
Fire Caste	The Fire Caste (or Shas) is one of the five Castes of Tau Society, structured around war. Members of the Fire Caste are the warriors of the Tau Empire, and as such are most often seen on the field of battle. They have been bred to be the strongest and most aggressive Tau, and weak strains are quickly weeded out. These traits come from the Fire Caste's origin on the plains of T'au, where they were hunters and warriors. Fire Warriors, as soldiers of the Fire Caste are known, spend their entire lifetimes in battle or preparing for it, constantly honing their tactics and working to improve their skills. The strongest of the strong are those Tau from the world of Vior'la, who have slightly greater muscle mass because of the stronger gravity of that planet.[1a] The Fire Caste is guided by the Code of Fire — a doctrine of loyalty, martial arts, and merciless war, tempered by wisdom.[1a][2a] Provided the warrior survives four years of active duty, he undergoes the first Trial by Fire, which can be anything from mere gladiatorial affairs to trial by constant combat. If the Shas'la survives his first Trial by Fire, he is promoted to the rank of Shas'ui, or Veteran. For every consecutive four years of service, the Fire Warrior undergoes another Trial. The higher one's rank within the Fire Caste, the more likely one is to become a Battlesuit pilot. Only those Fire Warriors who prove themselves in battle and pass their first Trial by Fire are eligible to don the Her'ex'evre or Mantle of Heroes and pilot the battlesuit. Upon attaining the rank of "O", a member of the Fire Caste may be allowed to retire from active duty and become an advisor to the Tau military's command, the Shas'ar'tol. Other than death, this is the only way to leave the Tau military.[1b]
Charpactin	The Charpactin are a race of sentient fungoid creatures who encountered the T'au Empire's Fe'saan Water Caste diplomats during the Fifth Sphere of Expansion. They communicate entirely in bursts of ultraviolet colour, whose strobing emanations prove surprisingly effective at subduing and transfixing living beings — making them docile and amenable. After the Water Caste observed this in action, the T'au Empire quickly negotiated a client-state treaty with the Charpactin and have since drafted many of the fungoid creatures into its growing Edification Corps. Ethereal • Air • Earth • Fire • Water
The Greater Evil (Short Story)	The Greater Evil is a Dark Coil short story by Peter Fehervari. In the far reaches of the Damocles Gulf, an expedition of the T'au Empire heads for the system known to the Imperium as Yuxa, there to bring the influence of the Greater Good to humanity – and investigate the reappearance of a Water Caste ambassador thought lost years before. Joined by a mysterious Ethereal and defended by gue'vesa auxiliaries – soldiers once of mankind's Imperium, now devoted to the Greater Good – the expedition's leader expects a trap... But what he finds may just change his perceptions of the galaxy.
Gal'leath Class Battleship	The Gal'leath class battleship (known as the Explorer among the Imperials) was the first major interstellar vessel developed by the Tau. Compared to the average speed of an Imperial ship in the warp, the Explorer could barely approach a fifth of this speed. It is also significantly less well armed and armoured, compared to most battleships. It does have a massive cargo capacity, however, and is much cheaper to produce than other ships of similar tonnage. Indeed, it was only the advent of war with the Orks that finally made the Tau design an alternate vessel for interstellar combat, a role which the Explorer is ill suited to undertake alone. The Explorer has undergone many different refits and reconfigurations since its inception. The two most common that are still active within the Kor'vattra are the Mk XXIII Vash'ya and the Mk XXIV Bor'kan configurations.
Ethereal Guard	The Ethereal Guard, also known as Tau Honour Guards are Tau warriors who serve as the bodyguards and protectors of Ethereals, the undisputed leaders of the Tau Empire. They also act as a secret police force within the Empire.[3a] Specifically bred and trained from the Fire Caste[3a] for their duties, Ethereal Guards are physically large and well-muscled for Tau. They are also fanatically loyal to their Ethereals even by the standards of the Tau. These warriors are dressed in ritual garb but wear Recon Armour and wield Honour Blades.[1a] An Ethereal is always protected by at least two members of the Ethereal Guard. Besides acting as their bodyguards, Ethereal Guards also serve as the enforcers of the will of the Ethereal Caste and will arrest suspected dissidents with the aid of police Drones.[3a]
Tau Auxiliaries	The T'au Empire's military forces frequently incorporate auxiliary troops, recruited from conquered worlds during the Damocles Crusade. Ethereal • Air • Earth • Fire • Water Anthrazod • Boaburi • Brachyura • Charpactin • Demiurg • Domati • Formosian • G’nosh • Galg • Greet • Humans • Hrenian • Jagordian • Ji'atrix • Kroot • Morralian • M'uh'ja • Nagi • Nicassar • Ostense Council • Phosiab • Pohu-Agg • Ranghon • Tarellians • Thraxians • Vespid • Vorgh • Yabi-Yabi
Anthrazod	The Anthrazods are a species of the T'au Empire. They are considered by the T'au to be a sturdy (if dim-witted) race and have proved well-suited for asteroid mining. Ethereal • Air • Earth • Fire • Water Anthrazod • Boaburi • Brachyura • Charpactin • Demiurg • Domati • Formosian • G’nosh • Galg • Greet • Humans • Hrenian • Jagordian • Ji'atrix • Kroot • Morralian • M'uh'ja • Nagi • Nicassar • Ostense Council • Phosiab • Pohu-Agg • Ranghon • Tarellians • Thraxians • Vespid • Vorgh • Yabi-Yabi
Ethereal Supreme	The Ethereal Supreme is the highest-ranking member of the Tau Empire Ethereal Council and the de facto leader of the Tau Empire.
Malk'la	The Malk'la is a type of ritual punishment in the Tau Empire. Considered a rare event, Malk'la can only be declared by an Ethereal against a Tau who has erred in a particularly grievous fashion. Those subjected to this punishment are rendered pariahs in their own society. Often, such souls will seek to sell out their lives in hopes of regaining their status with a worthy death.
Domati	The Domati are an alien species that are auxiliary allies of the T'au Empire. The Domati were auxiliary allies of the T'au Farsight Expedition, with Domati Wyrmships part of the Grand Reclamation Fleet alongside T'au vessels, Nicassar Dhows, Vespid Nest Vessels, Kroot Warspheres, Demiurg Bastions, and Greet Stealthers. The Domati have Wyrmship space vessels.
Lar'shi Class Cruiser	The Lar'shi Class Starship — codenamed "Hero" — was born out of the Damocles Gulf Crusade. During that conflict, the Tau had been shown first-hand where the Kor'vattra was lacking, and attempted to design a ship that could match the Imperium's Lunar Class Cruiser. Although the resulting vessel was still no match for a comparable Imperial warship, the vessel that resulted was nonetheless a credible ship of the line. As a purebred combat ship, the Lar'shi is significantly more effective in a straight-up firefight than its Gal'leath and Il'fannor predecessors. In its primary Vash'ya configuration, the Lar'shi packs a great deal of firepower in the form of a forward Gravitic Launcher, a forward Railgun turret, two launch bays for Barracudas and Mantas, and a pair of Ion Cannon turrets, the latter of which are replaced by slightly weaker but longer-ranged Railgun batteries in the less-common Tolku variant. Both versions are protected by a Deflector that enhances their forward armour, allowing them to survive a head-on confrontation and bring their weapons' overlapping fields of fire to bear on an enemy.
Brachyura	The Brachyura are a species that has joined the T'au Empire native to a planet of the same name. A tiny dexterous-limbed crustacean race, they are unmatched in the delicate assembly of small Plasma Generators needed to fuel T'au Earth Caste inventions.

Information Awareness	Information Awareness is the primary intelligence body of the Tau Empire. The Tau place great value in intelligence, and thus Information Awareness operates centers at the Coalition level. It is not overseen by a single Caste, but rather each caste contributes its own resources. The Fire Caste oversees military intelligence, the Water Caste spies and personnel intelligence, the Earth Caste electronic intelligence, and the Air Caste aerial, satellite, and fleet-based intelligence. Ethereals are the chief overseers of Information Awareness, serving as a unifying body for the disparate assets involved. The collections and special operations arm of Information Awareness is known as the Hundred Eyes. The Hundred Eyes is often deployed far ahead of Kor'vattra fleets years in advance, gathering information on potential enemies and organizing sympathetic local assets to fight for the Tau. Most Tau believe Hundred Eyes to just be a term for integrated intelligence, but it is in fact a highly secretive body made up of Water Caste operatives.
Skether'qan Class Starship	The Skether'qan, aka the Messenger, is one of the smallest Tau ships equipped with a Gravitic Drive.[Needs Citation] The Skether'qan is not a true fighting vessel in its own right, possessing only a single small Railgun battery. Instead, it stays near larger ships and uses its excellent maneuverability to stay out of danger as it uses its sophisticated Tracking System to aid other vessels in a fleet in targeting enemy ships.[Replace citation]
M'uh'ja	The M'uh'ja are a hulking sentient Xenos species, who have joined the Tau Empire. They were among the Empire's allied species that aided in the rebuilding of Dal'yth, after the Damocles Crusade.

T'au Sha'ng	Shas'la T'au Sha'ng, better known as Longstrike, is a Tau warrior of the Fire Caste. Known as the Tau's most decorated tank ace, since his first training sessions he has exhibited a natural ability to handle the Hammerhead Gunship. Due to his superb aim and reputation, Longstrike was chosen as a test subject for the Tau's new XV02 Pilot Battlesuit, which allows him to interface directly with his Hammerhead and negate the need for a crew. It was on T'ros where the young Hammerhead pilot to become known as Longstrike first gained fame. As part of an armored interdiction Cadre, he was assigned to fighting in the western deserts and oversaw the destruction of countless Imperial Guard Leman Russ Battle Tanks. The Leman Russ tanks outnumbered Hammerhead gunships of his brothers at least six to one. However at the peak of fighting, Sha'ng's bond-mates were all slain in the battle. Nonetheless he continued on, discharging Railgun after railgun blast, each destroying a Leman Russ in the distance. The tank duel went on until a squadron of Razorshark fighters appeared to finish the attackers. But even as the Imperial forces retreated, Sha'ng continued to fire at them and continued to score hits despite the distance. He even scored a direct headshot on an Imperial Warhound Titan, destroying the mighty war machine. After the battle, Sha'ng's exploits earned him the name of Longstrike. Longstrike was redeployed during the battle for Mu'gulath Bay during the Third Sphere of Expansion, where he destroyed innumerable Imperial gun and bunker emplacements. As the fighting moved into the narrow Hive streets, Longstrike's lightning fast reactions thanks to his XV02 Pilot battlesuit allowed him to destroy infantry attempting to emerge from cover and attack before they could even get off a shot.
Puretide	Commander Puretide (651-731.M41)[2b] was a legendary Tau Commander during the Second Sphere of Expansion of the Tau Empire. His campaigns greatly expanded the Tau Empire and many Tau septs were founded through the efforts and sacrifices of his warriors. The Septs of Elsy'eir and Tash'var owe their existence to his victories, and it is said that his brilliant tactics in long-range firepower and maneuver made battle unenjoyable for even the Orks.[2d] He later opposed the human Imperial expeditionary forces of the Damocles Crusade leading the Tau defenders of Dal'yth, a major Tau sept. He was seriously wounded near the end of his life[2a] by raiders while inspecting his troops, and now unable to effectively lead his men he retreated to Mount Kan'ji on Dal'yth. There, he spent the rest of his days[2a] as a hermit writing philosophy, developing doctrine, and teaching a new generation of Fire Warriors.[2a] Puretide is known for his treatise upon war written after his retirement from active duty. It teaches a balanced, variable, and flexible approach. Many Fire Warriors have read and studied his work, but almost none have been able to fully assimilate and understand all his teachings. Most are only able to grasp and focus themselves on one aspect among several, and his greatest students have been placed into cryogenic stasis by the Ethereals in hopes of being unfrozen in the future when they are needed. The greatest among Puretide's disciples are O'Shovah, O'Shaserra and O'Kais.[2a]
Galg	Galgs (Admuninus Sextus) are a strange alien race. The Galgs originate from the planet of Adummin, now incorporated into the T'au Empire. They were not particularly warlike and not too advanced technologically, yet had effectively created a paradise on their world which did not know suffering. The Galgs spent thousands of years in this state, wanting for nothing in their underground palace-cities. Their only fear was for the "Maku", a species whom they believed lived even deeper on Adummin; Galg lore claimed that any Galg who lived an unworthy life would become a "Maku" after death. The Galgs' history greatly changed, however, when they encountered the T'au. According to some tellings of the events, the Galgs joined the T'au willingly, happy to give up their lives of pleasure seeking to be given purpose within the Greater Good. Conversely, other sources say that the Galgs were conquered or coerced to join the T'au some centuries before the end of M41. Both accounts have been given credence by independent Galg mercenaries who roam the wider Galaxy since Adummin's integration into the T'au Empire. Some Galgs state that the T'au gave their species new purpose and prevented them from wasting their potential, but others have organised as "freedom fighters" to overthrow T'au rule.[3a] This suggests that the encounter with the T'au was accompanied by a split of the Galg species into opposing factions.[3a]
Bork'an	Bork'an is a Tau Sept, a world within the Tau Empire, known as an education, industrial, and manufacturing hub.[8a] Bork'an was originally the homeworld of the Poctroon, but after disease devastated their race the Tau inherited it.[3a][4a] The sept was subsequently founded as part of the First Phase Expansion.[2a] Bork'an is renowned as the center of education for the Tau Empire and is home to many libraries, universities, and research centers,[1a] including the most prestigious military training centre in all of the Empire.[4b] Its systems also has many rich mining planets and Fire Warriors of this Sept outfitted with the especially fine equipment and weapons.[7a] The warriors of Bork'an known as cerebral and restrained and its population in general is amongst the most scientific, sporting the highest Earth Caste population.[7b][8a] Some of Bork'an's most noted scientist achievements are stasis chambers and the first Pilot Battlesuit. Rumor has it that Bork'an science cadres were transported in secret to N'dras at the early end of the Second Sphere of Expansion to develop the deadly Ghostkeel Battlesuit.[8a]
Greater Good	The Greater Good, or Tau'va (literally, "Good Greater"), is the founding collectivist principle of Tau society. The Tau'va system is based on a Caste System and is designed to allow for the advancement of the entire Tau society together towards a more successful, prosperous and easier existence in the future. The Tau'va can be summed up simply: that any individual life of any given member of the Tau Empire is of less importance than the needs of the Empire itself. Followers of the Greater Good will gladly expend incredible efforts, endure horrific hardships, and lay down their lives without a second thought in order to furtherance the Tau'va. Moreover, they believe that it is their duty to carry this creed out into the stars and unify every sentient species beneath their banner. The Tau put great importance in every achievement and personal sacrifice that advances this goal. Those who excel in the service of the Greater Good are lauded, while those rare few who allow personal hubris, vanity or selfishness to come first are vilified. The Tau feel genuine pity and compassion for those races not under the Tau'va, which are labeled primitive and ignorant. The Greater Good believes each and every member of the Empire has its place and value, and this is reflected in the stringent Caste System which predetermines ones lot in life. According to the Greater Good, displays of self-directed wealth or individualism are viewed as disdainful. Yet equally there is nothing of the poverty or squalor that afflicts most other civilizations of the Galaxy. Yet the Tau and other races of their Empire have little say in their destiny, which is controlled entirely by the unquestionable edicts of the Ethereals, who act as the first amongst equals. No Tau or ally would dare contradict an Ethereal, and they will gladly toil away their entire lives for the Greater Good surrounded by carefully cultivated propaganda.
Formosian	The Formosians are a race that has joined the T'au Empire. They joined the empire at the convincing of the Golden Ambassador in 896.M40.

Aun'shi	Aun’el Viora’la Shi is a T'au Ethereal from the Vior'la Sept of the T'au Empire. Aun'shi frequently accompanies Fire Warrior squads as Shas'aun'shi.[1a] His titles include Master of the Blade, Saviour of the Fire Caste, Hero of Fio'vash, and The Aged Wonder. In what was supposed to be his final assignment before retirement, he was sent to the planet of Kel'tyr, to oversee a mining colony dealing with Feral Ork tribes.[1b] During the inspection of the town of Fio'vash, they came under attack by one such tribe of Orks, intent upon capturing the mine workings there. When the Shas'vre in charge of the Fire Warrior garrison was killed, Aun'shi dispatched a messenger and a Stealthsuit Team to the capital for help and in the meantime led the defence himself, slaughtering Orks by the dozen, armed with only his Honour Blade.[1b]

It was written by the High Admiralty; a Games Workshop-sanctioned board of fans who have been charged with all future development of the game.[Needs Citation]
Ta'lissera	The Bonding Knife is a ceremonial knife that serves as part of the Tau ritual of the Ta'lissera, in which a group is bonded together through ritualistic cutting of their flesh.[1b] Following their ritual bonding the knife is then carried into battle by the team leader, although it is not designed for use in actual combat, and serves as a reminder of the sacred bond the group shares. Fire Warriors who serve as part of a Battlesuit team may also undergo the process, although instead of carrying the actual knife into battle the team leader may instead paint a knife design onto his armour.[1a] The Ta'lissera is a Tau ceremony which has been translated by Imperial xenolexicons as "communion" or "marriage." Tau who take part in the ceremony pledge support and community to one another and may address each other by their individual names. The bonds that these Tau swear to each other are much admired and seen as embodying the best aspects of the Greater Good. While the bond may be performed by any group of Tau, it is most commonly Fire Caste warriors or Earth Caste work teams who undergo this ultimate expression of respect for one another.[1b] A common Fire Caste proverb is: Only in death are the bonded parted.
Phosiab	The Phosiab are a sentient Xenos species, who have joined the Tau Empire. They can see reality in nine dimensions and slip through the void unharmed. These abilities are a boon to the Tau Empire's extra-orbital construction. Ethereal • Air • Earth • Fire • Water
Aun'Va	"Our Conquest is inevitable, our ascension a matter of time. Let none who are wise deny our destiny."[2b] Aun'Va is the most recent known T'au Ethereal Supreme, the Aun'o of the T'au Empire and Master of the Undying Spirit.[1a] His full name was Aun'o'T'au'Acaya'Va'Denta and his title included Master of the Undying Spirit and stood as supreme Ethereal in the new Spheres of Expansion with Commander Shadowsun at his side at all times. He led them forward to new frontiers and enemies.[1a]
Gue'vesa	Gue'vesa (literally, "Human Helpers") are Human soldiers who serve as Auxiliaries in the T'au military. Human auxiliary troopers are a fairly common sight along the western fringes of Tau space, in particular on those worlds contested during the Damocles Gulf Crusade. The T'au proved a hardier foe than anticipated by Imperial forces and, as the offensive stalled, they were forced to hurriedly withdraw in response to the far greater threat presented by the arrival of Hive Fleet Behemoth in nearby sectors. Gue'la throughout the Empire are often the descendants of those abandoned Imperial Guard troops or the colonies captured in the aftermath of their defenders' retreat. For them, fate has dictated that the rule of the Adeptus Terra be replaced by loyalty to the collectivist T'au Empire and the ruling Ethereal caste. Those humans who have embraced the Greater Good in this way are provided with the technology required to prevail on the T'au frontier and granted limited production capabilities, allowing them to construct equipment ranging from simple farming tools to a copy of the standard issue Imperial lasgun. In times of war, the T'au allow the Gue'vesa access to more advanced weaponry such as Pulse rifles, Pulse Carbines and other, more specialised equipment including gear like Markerlights, EMP Grenades, and tranquility wafers. These auxiliaries have become a (usually) respected part of the T'au military, filling a tactical niche between the barbaric Kroot and the mainstay of T'au armies, the Fire Warrior teams. Gue'vesa may lack the close combat savagery of the Kroot but they are fully capable of using the more advanced examples of T'au technology, zealously doing so to further the cause of the Greater Good.
Thraxian	The Thraxians are a chitin-covered multi-armed Xenos species that was discovered by Humanity after they began to migrate into Imperial territory.

Vespid	The Vespid (known as Stingwings by the Imperial Guard and Mal'Kor by the T'au) are an insectoid race allied with the T'au Empire. Hailing from the world of Vespid, the race was already fairly technologically adept when they were approached by the T'au Empire's Water Caste diplomats. It seemed unlikely that the Vespid would ever submit for the Greater Good, as their mindset was so freakishly different to anything the T'au could understand that their emissaries made little headway. However, after the Ethereals provided the Vespids with a custom-made communication headset, they suddenly became completely compliant, calmly accepting total annexation by the T'au Empire. Rumours have circulated ever since as to what true purpose these headsets serve.[4a] Vespid were at first mostly in the background of the T'au Empire and were rarely encountered by the galaxy at large. While useful as fast light infantry or scouts, the limitations of their communications helm made it hard for Fire Caste commanders to issue complex orders. Eventually a solution was found by giving Strain Leaders' helmets a neural link to the Fire Caste handler and issuing a Oversight Drone. Now, the T'au may finally utilise Vespids for complex independent operations where a Stingwing can operate in the field for weeks alone.
Tau Quotes	This article needs work on its citations.For help on citation see the citation guidelines. You can help Lexicanum by fixing it. This article collects all statements made by, or concerning, the Tau,. The quotes themselves are organized in alphabetical order using the speaker's name. N.B. Tau names follow different rules: 1st = Caste; 2nd = Rank; 3rd = Home planet; 4th = cognomen (i.e., the true name as we understand it). Because it is possible for two Tau individuals to share the same cognomen, they can be distinguished most easily by their other names, such as their home planets.

You can help to restore them to the article by finding the correct citations and re-integrating the quarantined text and/or images as described in the Help article on citations. The Kroot (scientific name Krootis aviana,[4a] referenced by the Imperium as Kroot Carnivore[6a]) are a humanoid species of xenos. They appear throughout the galaxy, but are most frequently associated with the T'au Empire. The Kroot originated on their homeworld of Pech, and there is evidence to suggest that their evolution was avian in origin. Thousands of years ago, an Ork Rok crash-landed on Pech and the Greenskin survivors were promptly eaten by the native inhabitants. After several generations, the first true city of the Kroot had been erected around the wreck. Using their newly incorporated Orkoid DNA, the Kroot were able to interact with the Mekboy technology found aboard the crashed Rok. Within the span of a few thousand years, the Kroot had used the Greenskin technology to create five primary "Hive" cities, factory farming, and mining. They were also able to construct their first warp-capable spacecraft in the form of Warspheres and take to the stars. Soon the Kroot were able to colonise several worlds close to Pech.
O'Shovah	"Each must find their own way. If those in our heartland had witnessed the savageries of the void as have we they would know this. The hand of each of the starfarers is turned against the other; none will join their strength together just to see their ancient enemies prosper. Neither should we."[2d] Shas'O Vior'la Shovah Kais Mont'yr, aka O'Shovah or Commander Farsight, is alleged to still be leading the Farsight Enclaves, although this would mean that he has lived for at least three centuries, considerably beyond the ordinary lifespan of T'au Fire Caste members. It may be that another has taken up his mantle, or that the real Commander is extending his lifespan through some technological process. One thing that is certain is that the breakaway Farsight Enclave maintains a strongly martial tradition closely based on the Vior'la Sept (lit: "hot-blooded"), O'Shovah's birthplace.[4c] Even before he was known as Shovah, the young Vior'lan absorbed and memorised every facet of the Vior'la Fire Warrior training academy. He spent much time in the Mont'yr Battle Dome war simulations and quickly became able to memorise the Code of Fire from end to end. He even deciphered the combat codes and signals used by his superiors, taking advantage of his knowledge to monitor their communiques. Despite being several years younger than most T'au within the Mont'yr Battle Dome, Shoh quickly outperformed his classmates. During Shoh's graduation from the academy, the legendary Commander Puretide was there to inspect the ceremony.[4c]
Greet	The Greet are an invertebrate Xenos species from the Ocean World of Isla'su that are part of the T'au Empire.[1a] The Greet joined the T'au Empire after the Earth Caste agreed to build them many floating factories in a negotiation led by the Golden Ambassador.[1a][1b] This in turn paid for the protection of their planet by T'au Space Stations and allowed the Greet to contribute to the Greater Good.[1a] The Greet are known to have been infiltrated by Genestealer colonies, though the Greet have not proved to be an ideal host.
Nagi	The Nagi are a xenos race from the world of Sha'galudd. Highly intelligent worm-like creatures, the small Nagi are known for their mind control abities. When they were first discovered by the Tau Empire, they were despised by the Tau, who fought a series of violent conflicts with them. However they have since agreed to a peace accord and have joined the Tau Empire. Nagi frequently serve as advisors to the Ethereal Caste. Ethereal • Air • Earth • Fire • Water
Pohu-Agg	The Pohu-Agg are a sentient Xenos species of the Batrazadji Cluster, who have joined the Tau Empire. However the species' sheer ferocity initially caused them to resist the Tau Empire, which led to the War of Integration. The Ethereal Aun'Jash later brought the conflict to an end, by unleashing the Neuro-empathic Nullifier on the Pohu-Agg. Doing so, made the species docile long enough for the Ethereal to convince them to join the Tau Empire. Ethereal • Air • Earth • Fire • Water
Il'fannor Class Cruiser	The Il'Fannor class cruiser (designated as Merchant class by the Imperium) was the next major ship designed by the T'au after the Gal'leath Class Battleship. It was originally designed to become the new workhouse of the fledgling T'au Empire, its Gravitic Drive being able to reach a third of normal warp speed. As the Gal'leath proved ineffective as a military vessel against the Orks, the Merchant was heavily redesigned into a cheap and effective (if rather slow) warship that remained the T'au's mainline military ship until the advent of the Lar'shi class. As a cruiser, it lacks the hard-hitting firepower, speed and durability of those of the other major races, but makes up for it by being very cheap and easy to produce. There exist two current configurations of the Il'fannor cruiser, the Ke'lshan and Dal'yth.
Coalition	A Coalition (Tau: Shan'Al) is a Tau organization combining all four Commands of a particular location, usually a world or solar system. Led by an Ethereal or council of such, Coalitions are where cooperation between the different Castes is coordinated in order to further the Greater Good. This arraignment also serves as a check in the entirely unlikely event of rebellion by one of the castes, limiting the potential revolt to a single planet which can be easily contained. In addition to organizing all Tau activities within a given area, Coalitions are also formed in order to peacefully bring new worlds into the Tau Empire. These Coalitions are devised well in advance of a conflict and tailor-made for each particular situation. Each Coalition will be labeled based on their intended function, such as Emergent Crisis Expedition, Encounter Observation Team or Threat Dissipation Contingent. Tau Coalitions have an Ethereal-run intelligence center operated by Information Awareness.
Command (Tau)	A Command (Tau: Uash'O) is a grouping of all members of a particular Tau Caste of a given location; often this will be a planet or solar system. Likewise Commands are classified by their location and caste members, i.e. 'Air Caste Command Nimbosa'. For the Fire Caste, the most senior Tau Commander is placed in charge of a Command and may be referred to as High Commander.
Vior'la	Vior'la is a Tau Sept which orbits a binary star and is known for its extreme temperatures and difficult living conditions. The planet passes through a gap of two stars each year, causing plasma storms to ravage the planet in a time called the "Trial by Fire". The word Vior'la literally translates as "hot blooded". It is a notorious Fire Caste world containing centuries old academies that are reputed as the most respected in the empire. The most renowned of these are Va'shea, Fo'ur'as, and Ko'vrett based around Vior'la Prime. Known foremost for their military prowess, Vior'la warriors produced here are particularly aggressive and well-schooled in high-speed warfare and often choose Mont'ka strategy.[4b] Even when employing Kauyon tactics, Vior'la commanders use their own trademark aggression, luring in enemy assets to cause them to cry for aid before unleashing devastating ambushes. The sept warriors of Vior'la are usually painted with hot colours, like red and orange, and usually have many Fire Warriors and Battlesuits. The citizens of Vior'la are proud of their "edge", and their Earth Caste Scientists have been responsible for short-ranged high-impact weapons such as the Pulse Carbine and Pulse Blaster as well as the Onager Gauntlet. Its Water Caste are similarly forthright, known as hard-bargainers and profitable risk-takers.
Tau Merchant Fleet	The Tau Merchant Fleet is the state-owned mercantile armada of the Tau Empire. In the early days of their space-borne expansion, the Tau made little distinction between trade and conquest. Their heavily-armed and armored trading vessels served them well in early conflicts, blazing a trail of expansion. However upon encountering the Imperium, the Tau were forced to modernize their vessels and build dedicated warships. Today, the older generation of Tau warships still serve within the Merchant Fleet. The Merchant Fleet is composed of very few, slow, and well-equipped vessels. Each is equally capable of destroying the foe at a variety of ranges, relying on their formidable shields to keep the vessel intact while barrages of ordnance and torpedoes reduce the enemy to ruin.
Tarellian	Tarellians, also called Tarellian Dog-Soldiers (or "dog soldiers"), are a minor reptilian species of alien found throughout much of the galaxy. According to legends the Imperium virus-bombed a few of the Tarellians' worlds during the Emperor's Great Crusade. This has given the Tarellians a deep hatred of the Imperium, even 10 millennia later. Tarellians are called dog soldiers because of their long canine-like faces. They are narrow-waisted, broad shouldered and a bit shorter than most humans. Their fingers are described as clawed, and Tarellians are known to have knees and ribs.

You can help to restore them to the article by finding the correct citations and re-integrating the quarantined text and/or images as described in the Help article on citations. Drones are AI-controlled light hovering vehicles that perform a variety of civilian and military roles for the T'au. Unlike the Imperium of Man, the Tau make extensive use of these and other machine intelligences.[1a][2a] Drones are conventionally disk-shaped, armoured, and equipped with an anti-gravitic generator and jet motors for propulsion. Their advanced processor unit has only a basic intelligence, which requires regular orders from their masters, often through a drone controller. It is also programmed for self-preservation, and will typically flee in the face of danger (drones without propulsion systems will instead self-destruct upon capture). However, Drones can network together, increasing their intelligence and processing speed. This allows them to operate in a group independently of a controller for long periods of time.[1a][2a][5a]

O'Shaserra	"To follow any path other than the Tau’va is to doom us all. Only together and with courage and discipline shall we stand victorious. Fight with fire and courage and nothing can stand against us." O'Shaserra, also known as Commander Shadowsun, is the current Tau Empire supreme commander. The young Shas spent much of her youth on Dal'yth as a student of the famed Commander Puretide alongside his other pupils Shoh and Kais. Together, they braved the harsh and frigid conditions of Mount Kan'ji. All three survived and were accepted as full students of Puretide. Shas would go on to become a famous subordinate of Shoh, who became known as Commander Farsight.[13a]
Orbital City	Orbital Cities are large orbital habitats where much of the Air Caste is born and raised. They are somewhat necessitated by the fact that, while Air Caste Tau can enter a gravity well (such as to pilot Barracudas), it is unknown what effect it would have on their weightlessness-adapted physiques.
Nicassar	The Nicassar are a psychic xenos race who were the first addition to the T'au Empire.[Conflicting sources] The Nicassar are highly psychic. Fearing that the Imperium's distrust of psykers would intensify their already dangerous xenophobia, the T'au have carefully kept them hidden from humans. Physically, Nicassars are ursine in appearance and have ivory hair-quills and stubby, clawed limbs. They possess no eyes, instead sensing their surroundings with psychic abilities generated by glands in their avian skulls. Nicassar are described as having long, furred snouts.
Yasu'caor	The Yasu'caor is the guiding philosophy of the Yasu'aun, the Ethereal analog to the Impium’s Inquisition.
Battle (Tau)	A Battle (Tau: Kavaal) is a grouping of Fire Caste Contingents and represents the largest field unit of the Tau military. As with Contingents a Battle is a temporary formation, created to achieve a specific military objective before being dissolved.
Battlesuit	Battlesuits (termed Her'ex'vre in the T'au Lexicon, meaning "Mantle of the Hero") are bipedal mobile armoured platforms used by the T'au. They incorporate many weapons, advanced armour, and a variety of systems, allowing them to fulfil many specific roles within the T'au military.[2a] Battlesuits are a type of advanced power armour, with the larger models likened by Imperial observers to fast-moving (and infinitely more graceful) Dreadnoughts. They vary in size, from no bigger than a Fire Warrior in standard armour, to being twice as tall as a Space Marine (with the new XV104 Riptide having surpassed even this).. Battlesuits vary in role, from battlefield infiltration to fire support. Most are designed to be worn by a single Fire Warrior and are packed with advanced weaponry and devices, including multi-spectrum sensors and scanners useful for detecting hidden enemies, and recoil absorption technology which, while not providing the same stability as Terminator Armour, allows for accurate shooting of light weaponry while moving. Battlesuits are piloted directly by a neuro-link from the operator, which interfaces with the vehicle through a monofilament needle inserted through the back of the head into their brain. This allows the pilot to make the Battlesuit an extension of their own body movements, allowing for fast and fluid reactions. Modern Battlesuits are equipped with dense nanocrystalline alloy armour with liquid metal coatings, which while providing superior durability and protection to internal systems is also light enough to avoid unnecessary encumbrance. Damage to armour and internals can be transmitted to the pilot's nervous system as sympathetic pain via the inner cocoon, though only ever at level sufficient to inform pilots and never intense enough to distract.[16a]
Ostense Council	The Ostense Council are an alien group that are known to have acted as mercenaries for the Tau Empire. During the Fourth Sphere of Expansion of the Tau Empire, Winged Discs of the Ostense Council were included as mercenaries in the Tau Fleet, fitted with Slipstream devices. When they entered the Warp, the mercenary ships were attacked by Daemons, including the Ostense Council's Winged Discs, Greet Lineships, Human Cruisers and Cutters, Kroot Warspheres, and Nicassar Dhows. The Daemons ripped open the craft, and physically carved the crews apart with weapons, bare hands, and mouths. The Ostense Council have Winged Disc space vessels.
Kles'tak Explosives	Kles'tak Explosives are high-density Tau explosives that can be packed into the chassis of their military drones. With the explosives in them, the drones turn into highly mobile bombs, controlled by Fire Warriors, that when remotely detonated are strong enough to blow apart a Space Marine.
Boaburi	The Boaburi are a sentient Xenos species who have joined the T'au Empire. They were among the Empire's allied species that aided in the rebuilding of Dal'yth, after the Damocles Crusade. Ethereal • Air • Earth • Fire • Water Anthrazod • Boaburi • Brachyura • Charpactin • Demiurg • Domati • Formosian • G’nosh • Galg • Greet • Humans • Hrenian • Jagordian • Ji'atrix • Kroot • Morralian • M'uh'ja • Nagi • Nicassar • Ostense Council • Phosiab • Pohu-Agg • Ranghon • Tarellians • Thraxians • Vespid • Vorgh • Yabi-Yabi
Air Caste	The Air Caste (or Kor) is one of the five Castes of Tau Society, based around air and space travel and trade. The Air Caste is charged with holding the Tau Empire together through the Kor'vattra, the Tau Empire's merchant and war-fleet in addition to operating Tau Orbitals and Fortress Stations. Formerly functioning as messengers, these days they are the Tau Navy and are sometimes called the "Invisible Caste", for they rarely if ever set foot upon planets. Living in Orbital Cities, Tau of the Air Caste are the tallest and most slender of all Tau, with long, skinny limbs and hollow bones developed due to lives lived mostly in low- and zero-gravity ships and space stations. In the past, before the time of the Mont'au, the Tau that originally became the Air Caste had membranes stretching between their limbs, allowing them to glide on air currents. Tau pilots tend to be superior pilots compared to their human counterparts because they have a better depth perception and higher G-tolerance, but lack battle-experience compared to the best Imperial fighter-pilots. The Air Caste also operates air defenses within Tau territory.
A Sanctuary of Wyrms (Short Story)	A Sanctuary of Wyrms is a short story by Peter Fehervari. It was originally released as part of Xenos Hunters (Anthology). On the sept of Fi'draah, a tau water caste ambassador is sent deep into the jungles of the mysterious Dolorosa Coil on a vital mission. As she and her companions explore an abandoned Imperial facility known only as 'The Sanctuary of Wyrms', they find humans both dead and alive, including those of the Imperium's elite alien hunters - the Deathwatch.
Contingent	A Contingent (Tau: Tio'Ve) is a grouping of Tau Hunter Cadres, typically between three to six, roughly equivalent to an Imperial Guard Regiment. Unlike a regiment a Contingent is a temporary formation, although over the course of an extended campaigns some Contingents will become more proficient working together. The most senior Cadre Commander will have command of the Contingent, with his personal Cadre essentially becoming the headquarters unit.
Ji'atrix	The Ji'atrix are a race of ethereal xenos in the T'au Empire, that have an affinity for the void and skill at space-faring. Ethereal • Air • Earth • Fire • Water Anthrazod • Boaburi • Brachyura • Charpactin • Demiurg • Domati • Formosian • G’nosh • Galg • Greet • Humans • Hrenian • Jagordian • Ji'atrix • Kroot • Morralian • M'uh'ja • Nagi • Nicassar • Ostense Council • Phosiab • Pohu-Agg • Ranghon • Tarellians • Thraxians • Vespid • Vorgh • Yabi-Yabi
Demiurg	The Demiurg are a race of short, semi-humanoid traders and miners allied with the T'au Empire.[7b] In truth, they are Kin of the Leagues of Votann which have been misidentified as a minor xenos race by the T'au and Humanity alike.[10a] During the Great Crusade they came under the notice of the Imperium of Man, who learned that they were a technologically advanced race that maintained cordial relations with several xeno cultures. They rarely enter the territory of mankind but by this era they maintained a clandestine mining installation at Tenebrae 9-50 with its existence not being widely known by the Imperium. Their once rarely sighted vessels began to be seen within increased frequency in the Ultima Segmentum in recent centuries. Imperial fleet strategists postulated the link for the increased Demiurg presence to expansion of the Tau Empire in the Eastern Fringe. There are three sightings of Demiurg among Tau and Kroot fleets around the Damocles Gulf. Some, however, believe that these activities are simply the result of Demiurg attempting to capitalize on the disruptions caused by the Tyranid hivefleets.[7b] It is unknown if 'Demiurg' refers to some culturally distinct group of the greater Squat species, or the species as a whole. They are involved heavily in trading and economic relations with the Tau (most notably introducing the T'au to Ion Weapons), though it is unclear if they formally joined the Empire. Like the Votann, they are said to be a race principally consisting of miners and traders.[7b]
Water Caste	The Water Caste (or Por) is one of the five Castes of T'au society, based around diplomacy, bureaucracy, commerce, propaganda, espionage, history,[12a] art,[12a] and law.[1a] The Water Caste serve the T'au Empire as traders, merchants, public servants, bureaucrats, administrators, diplomats, and ambassadors. The Water Caste are used as orators and propagandists for the T'au, hailing the exploits of successful Fire Caste Commanders.[12a] They have a keen sense of recognising beauty, and thus act as the T'au's artists.[12b] They also act as academics relating to history and the study of alien cultures.[12b] Members of the Water Caste are described as handsome and charismatic. The Water Caste interact with other races when such affairs are not handled by the Fire Caste, and often act as administrators of T'au worlds in the absence of an Ethereal governor. Like water, Water Caste bureaucrats fluidly move between other Castes and alien races incorporated within the Empire to make sure that it flows smoothly. The Water Caste are known for their great linguistic, diplomatic, and negotiation skills.
Genestealer	A Genestealer is a species of Tyranid used as the ultimate shock trooper. Their purpose is to advance ahead of a Hive Fleet and pinpoint potential planets for the Tyranids to devour. They are amongst the deadliest creatures in the Galaxy, combining high cunning and lightning-fast reactions and movement, with large, extremely sharp claws that can rip through the toughest armour in seconds.[1b] Genestealers were the first Tyranid species to be encountered by the Imperium. But before the Imperium had knowledge of the Tyranids as a species, they believed Genestealers were a separate species indigenous to the moons of Ymgarl (using leech-like creature called Csith as main host for reproduction) but then spread to other planets by infiltrating passing cargo ships and derelict Space Hulks.[1a] It is believed Genestealers were introduced to the moons of Ymgarl in M35 from Hive Fleet Tiamet in the Tiamet System, carried inside the Imperial vessels that were sent to destroy the system.[2a] In 680.M41, the first Genestealer Cult was encountered by the Imperium on Ghosar Quintus. When the Battle for Macragge with Hive Fleet Behemoth took place, Technomagi spent years classifying the left-behind bodies, including Genestealers used as Tyranid shock troops. Further investigation confirmed that all Genestealers were in fact Tyranids.[1a]
Morralian	Morralians are an alien species.[1a] Their soldiers, the Morralian Deathsworn, are known to fight alongside other species, such as the Tau, and as mercenaries for the Alpha Legion.[1a] The Morralian Deathsworn have been known to fight for the Tau. They formed part of the D'yanoi Sept's Be'etar Expeditionary Force, as part of its Auxiliary Reserve Despatch, alongside Kroot Carnivores, Vespid Stingwings, and Hrenian Light Infantry. The Deathsworn also fought as part of the xenos mercenaries of the Alpha Legion's Sons of the Hydra in their campaign to eradicate the Ultramarines' Successor Chapters guarding the rimward edge of the Maelstrom in late M41.[1a] They took part in the successful ground assault against the Marines Mordant's Fortress-Monastery the Bas-Silica on Vitrea Mundi.[1a] Here they fought alongside the Tarellians, Galgs, Fra'al, Sslyth, and Eldar Outcasts, and were united with them by a shared seething hatred of humanity.[1a] The use of different species was chosen to provide maximum strategic flexibility, and their extremely varied combat styles made them very difficult for even the Marines' Veterans to defend against.[1a][1b]
Yasu'aun	The Yasu'aun are an order of- and formal title for- Ethereal followers of the philosophy of Yasu'caor, known colloquially as Seekers. They perform a role in the T'au Empire somewhat similar to the Imperium’s Inquisition. Yasu'aun, literally meaning the-finders-of-the-truth-that-hides, are solitary mystics who wander space of interest to the T'au Empire, said to be able to pass unseen by members of other castes as they follow paths only Ethereals can comprehend. On occasion they are known to unexpectedly join T'au expeditions, never taking direct command but their direction always followed, as their presence is welcomed and held as a great honour. Seekers train diligently to transcend love, hate, sadness, and all other emotions, learning to instead perceive connections and anomalous elements – be they events, objects or individuals – so as to create harmony, spiritual and otherwise. They listen, learn, and conduct events by intuition alone in order to better tune the Greater Good.
Sept	A Sept, also known as a realm, is a star system, or a series of star systems, colonised by the T'au Empire; this includes all colonised planets, moons, and holdings such as orbital stations, and void structures within the system.[10a][10b] Each Sept is named after its Sept World, also known as Prime Planet or Capital Planet, from which the Sept is governed and is denoted by a different Sept Symbol and colour for each, often related to the unique culture of each Sept.[10b] Tau Septs are managed by an Elemental Council. This includes representatives from the five Tau Castes (Ethereal, Fire, Air, Water, and Earth) as well as a 6th observer seat that goes to a prominent member of an Auxiliary race for an "outside perspective". However final word on the Council ultimately goes to the Ethereal representative.
Voice of Experience (Short Story)	"Voice of Experience" is a short story by J. C. Stearns published in February 2020 by Black Library. Few are the humans who can claim to be trusted members of the T'au Empire. Among their number is Kalice Arkady, a former Astra Militarum officer whose conversion to the Greater Good has been total and successful. Alas, there are others among the gue'vesa – the human auxiliaries who fight alongside their t'au allies – who see their alien saviours as oppressors and would stand against them. Assigned to investigate a series of accidents that may be human sabotage against the t'au, Arkady is drawn into a mystery that will reveal new enemies lurking in the shadows...
Hunter Cadre	A Hunter Cadre or Cadre (Tau: Kau'Ui) is a standing combine-arms military formation of the Tau Empire. At its core the Hunter Cadre is composed of members of the Tau Fire Caste, organised into teams of warriors originating from the same Sept and often bound by the Ta'lissera, with allied species attached as Auxiliaries. Led by a veteran Tau Commander, and sometimes accompanied by an Ethereal, these cadres are considered to be capable of dealing with most any tactical situation they find themselves in on the battlefield. Averaging slightly more than fifty Tau, with some numbering up to a hundred in total, Hunter Cadres are roughly analogous to an Imperial Guard Company but differ in that the divergent combat arms are fully integrated at the tactical level and operate as one unit.[2a][2b] The typical Hunter Cadre will have anywhere up to six Fire Warrior Teams along with a number of Pathfinder, Stealthsuit and Crisis Battlesuit Teams. A cadre will also includes a handful of vehicles, from general units such as Hammerhead Gunships to more specialized versions such as Sky Rays. A large stockpile of additional vehicles and equipment are kept on hand so that the Cadre can operate in a variety of roles: for example, mounting all Fire Warrior teams on Devilfish troop transports so that it can operate as a mechanized force. Auxiliary troops, including Kroot, Vespid and Gue'vesa, are normally kept at a higher level such as Command and assigned to the Cadre for specific tactical roles. The two most common methods of warfare employed by Hunter Cadres are the Mont'ka and Kauyon. Each method is taught by the great Fire Caste academies on each Fire Caste world and have their own adherents amongst the Shas'o and Shas'el masters. They are both based on two approaches to hunting; Kauyon involves bringing the prey to the hunter, Mont'ka involves the hunter running the prey to ground.[2a]
El'Myamoto	Sub-Commander El'Myamoto, more commonly known as Darkstrider, is a renowned T'au Pathfinder. Although regarded as a cunning tactician, his unconventional methods and disregard for protocol have caused much trouble and made him many enemies among the T'au Empire. Myamoto began his career as a Shas'ui born on T'au, passing his Trials by Fire but scorning the honour of donning a Battlesuit. He was again offered an opportunity to wear one - a Stealth Battlesuit this time. However, he again rejected the offer. Instead, he preferred to return to the Pathfinder teams with which he had first served. In this capacity, he became infamous for leading his Pathfinders into near-suicidal situations but still escaping with glory. On Dal'yth, he shut down strange Necron mechanisms, while on Nep'tan he hunted down a strange tri-headed beast that terrorised local mining colonies. During the Great Wars of Confederation, the grim leader earned the nickname Darkstrider after infiltrating Ork camps and using markerlights to pick out Gargant components under construction. He has recently returned from battles against Imperial Space Marines in the Zeist Campaign. Myamoto regularly walks a fine line between insubordination and initiative, regularly spurning T'au Commanders. However, Commander Shadowsun values the sly tactics and bravery of Darkstrider and stated that she values working with him.
Calx	The Calx are described as a endemic Xenos species, found in the area of the planet Manga Unine. The Calx were the target of a decades long military campaign of the Imperium, comprising several million Imperial Guardsmen and eleven Adeptus Astartes Chapters, including the Iron Hands.
Broodlord	Broodlords are a Tyranid leader organism, regarded as the epitome of the Genestealer breed. Broodlords are even more powerful than the standard Genestealer, and are specifically adept at infiltration to get closer to the enemy. They are very adaptable and highly intelligent as well as being a synapse creature that allows them to function independently from the Hive Mind. Their powerful talons can cut through most materials with ease. The Broodlord is always the first Genestealer to make planetfall when the Tyranids first infest a world, and lead the Genestealers in their bloody ambushes.
Amphi	Amphi are an abhuman strain hailing from the world of Lampra. They are known to possess shapeshifting properties.
Orkoid physiology	The Ork Physiology is simple and robust made to allow Orks to survive the most horrendous injuries and still come back for more. The term Orkoids constitutes several races or species. Of the Orkoid species the Orks are the dominant race: There are two theories relating to why Orks have such a unique biology. The first is that they were adapted by their masters the Snotlings, a race that soared to intelligence upon eating a particular species of mushroom, spread across the galaxy with the help of their less intelligent Ork slaves, and were then deemed stupid again when the Orks consumed all traces of the mushroom which only grew on their home planet.[Needs Citation]
Prime Ork	Prime Orks is an Imperial designation given to hyper-evolved members of the Ork race. The end result of a extremely large and successful Waaagh!, Prime Orks display increased intelligence, technological capacity, and psychic power as well as massive physical size. One Prime Ork is described as approaching the size of a hab-block and fully encased in advanced Power Armor. The Prime Ork identified as The Beast spoke clear and fluent Gothic, something which shocked even the Primarch Vulkan. The Adeptus Mechanicus theorized that Prime Orks were the final evolution of the Orkoid race, evolved by the species out of necessity when an Orkoid empire reached a certain size and power. The description of Prime-Orks resembles that of the Krork, the legendary ancestors of the Ork race.
Abusir	The Abusir are a Xenos species.
Byavoor	The Byavoor are a former slave race of the Yu'vath that were used to feed the hunger of their alien masters by being incorporated into dark rituals. It is believed that the Yu'vath limited the thought processes of the Byavoor, making them more docile. This forced docility may have spared the entire race as the Inquisition decided they would not be deemed a threat during the Angevin Crusade. Currently the Byavoor are scattered around the Calixis Sector acting as mercenaries, and described as little more than "sentient cattle".
Borlac	The Borlac are a xenos race which has been heavily influenced by the Thexian Trade Empire.
Necrontyr	The Necrontyr were an ancient race of humanoids now long extinct. The Necrontyr's planet of origin was barren and radiation-blasted, making it incredibly hostile to life. Their bodies were ridden with radiation sickness and they lived a morbid life, constantly fearful of their coming deaths. Their cities were built in anticipation of their demise, little more than vast tomb complexes with a few temporary homes for the living. The Necrontyr attempted to overcome their mortality with scientific means, but realized after thousands of years that their bodies could not be changed to survive on the planet. Instead, they developed spacefaring technology, though of a much slower and more uncertain nature than the methods of the Old Ones. Where the Old Ones were able to move between the stars in seconds, the Necrontyr had to use slow-moving ships, equipped with stasis crypts, to reach out to the stars. They clad their ships in living metal to withstand the rigors of space flight. Despite establishing interstellar colonies, the Necrontyr still could not escape their genetic curse and continued to die quickly from tumorous growths.[3a]
Shrieker (Eldar)	Shriekers are feral bat-like Chaotic Eldar Mutants who dwell on Belial IV. Their ancestors were once normal Eldar who lived upon the Crone World, but a hundred generations of living within the Eye of Terror led the Shriekers to their current state. They now live in communal nests that lie high in Belial IV's ruins and hunt while letting loose the shrieks that give them their name. Upon encountering the creatures, the Apothecary Arrian Zorzi noted that the Shriekers were among the few stable Eldar ab-strains he had seen, although their their genetic code was degraded to the point of indecipherability.
Necron Pariah	Necron Pariahs are a symbiosis of Necron technology and human evolution, representing the next stage of the C'tan ideal for the galaxy.[1a] Necron Pariahs are crafted from the symbiosis of Necron technology and human evolution, specifically those carrying the Pariah Gene. Pariahs resemble artificial beings, radiating a sense of menace and horror to those nearby. Due to their soulless nature, Pariahs blot out psychic emanations and infuse those around them with a sense of their own mortality. Representing the next phase of the C'tan ideal for the galaxy, Pariahs embody the ultimate horror of the Necron threat.[1a] Necron Pariahs, besides their fear-inducing and anti-psychic abilities, are armed with with Warscythes with built-in Gauss Blasters. However, being a symbiosis of flesh and Necron technology, they are not true Necrons. Therefore, they do not possess the living metal skin the Necrons do, nor do they possess the ability to revive through resurrection protocols.[1a]
Carnoplasm	The Carnoplasm are a thankfully rare Xeno species, that attack worlds for prey to devour. They feed by liquifying and then drinking the flesh of their victims, leaving nothing of their bodies except a few scraps of brain and cerebrospinal tissue.
Brynarr	The Brynarr were xenos that at some point was devoured by the Tyranid race. It is said that the Swarmlord himself was responsible for the genocide of the Brynarr. At the same time just before the 13th Black Crusade one of the Cadian Regiments fought with the Brynarrs and noted that this xeno race were not warriors at all but rather sentimental towards their pupae - so they were systematically trapped and killed by Cadians.
Maug (Xenos Species)	The Maug are a liquid-based sentient Xenos species, that dwell in the Vadrius System. They are able to summon weapons at will from their bodies and are even capable of speaking a crude form of Low Gothic. Due to their physical makeup, the Maug have a amorphous 'spirit-like' appearance, which led early reports from Adeptus Mechanicus Explorator Fleets to describe them as Daemons. However later studies revealed the Maug's true nature to the Imperium and after they were declared to be Xenos Horrificus, the species was marked for destruction. Due to their liquid bodies, though, the species have proven to be almost unkillable, though their war with the Imperium continues to this day. The Rogue Trader and Xenologist Janus Draik, however, believes that with the threats now facing the Imperium, it will not be able to devote the resources needed to end such a small-scale threat, as the Maug.
Avloryx	The Avloryx are a sentient xenos race. Sometimes they serve Radical Inquisitors of the Ordo Xenos and sometimes even befriend their operatives.
Lazul	Lazul are an abhuman strain hailing from the world of Garganus Prime. They are known for their distinctive blue skin.
Pelager	The Pelagers, also known as Homo Sapien Oceanus, are a recognized strain of abhuman within the Imperium. Often hailing from worlds which are entirely underwater, Pelagers have the ability to breathe almost any liquid, and live under pressures which would crush any standard human, as well as standard pressures. They are possessed of iron-hard muscle, gills, scales, and are not dissimilar to an ogryn in size.
Stiltlimb	Stiltlimbs are a strain of abhumans that first appeared during the Age of Strife.
Chaotic Eldar	Chaotic Eldar are Aeldari who have fallen to Chaos. They are Mutants, monstrosities, newly chaos-tainted and the truly damned millennia-old survivors of the Fall: the Renegade Eldar Chaos Champions. To the rest of the Aeldari, Chaotic Eldar are kin no more, forever lost, intentionally forgotten and unacknowledged. Most of the Chaotic Eldar now survive on the Crone Worlds in the Eye of Terror. Asuryani Rangers who venture into the Eye of Terror make dealings with the Chaotic Eldar for Spirit Stones, Shuriken Casters, and other artifacts of the Eldar Empire. Expeditions are made regularly to the Tyrakesh Archeomarket on Arach-Cyn; Inquisitor Bronislaw Czevak has also had dealings at the market. Others survive throughout the Galaxy as isolated bands of chaos-devoted Pirates.
Ghilliam	Ghilliam are human mutants caused by irradiated or polluted voidship decks. Looking like sickly and crazed men, they are furtive scavengers with a pack mentality. Whether outcast, victim or fugitive, to become a Ghilliam is to leave humanity forever, descending to depths from which there is no return. Haunting the dark spaces and abandoned holds of great vessels, these debased, insane mutants are carrion eaters that subsist on whatever meat they can find and aren't too picky as to how they get it. They are dangerous and clever vermin and are exterminated mercilessly whenever possible.
Chittrix	The Chittrix are a parasitic race that is a new threat to the Imperium.
Thrix	Thrix are an abhuman strain. They possess famously lethal plumage.
Chimeriac	The Chimeriac are a sentient Xenos species, whose Shivertech is being studied by the Imperial Forge World Stygies VIII.
Byzaks	The Byzaks are rumoured to be a Xenos sentient species that reside within the Durotorum Sector. They are described as towering, clawed and hairy creatures, whose heads can rotate three hundred and sixty degrees. It is also said, that their heads have a face on either side of them.
Axlo	The Axlo are a rare Xenos species, that were targeted for destruction by the colossal cyborg known as the Cacodominus. This was brought about, after the immense cyborg used its Psychic powers to order an enthralled Dreadblade Knight to wipe out the species. Though the Cacodominus was later killed by the Black Templars, this did not stop the Dreadblade from carrying out its final orders. However the final fate of the Axlo species is not known.
Zoat	The Zoats are a centauroid, engineered slave race of the Tyranids, whose stocky build better enables them for ground combat and their advanced intellect allow them to act as ambassadors. Despite Zoats being bio-constructs of the Tyranids, should a Zoat somehow escape the influence of the Hive Mind, it may escape or rebel against the Tyranids and pursue their own agendas. It was initially believed that the Zoats were an engineered slave race of the Tyranids, known as bio-constructs. Like other bio-constructs, such as the Genestealers and Grabber-Slashers, the Zoats were created to fulfil a particular purpose. In the case of the Zoats, it is to communicate with alien creatures so that they may act as ambassadors and information gatherers, and to generally subvert other species to bring them under Tyranid control. Zoats are also speculated to have been created purely for combat, as their stocky builds easily enable them to perform under atmospheric conditions, unlike the space-faring Tyranids. Zoats are probably an ancient strain of bio-construct, as their six-limbed structure is shared with Tyranids and Genestealers. Their form is likely derived from the native creatures of the lost Tyranid homeworld in whatever remote galaxy thy originated from. Although they are a slave race, Zoats occupy important positions within the Hive Fleets, with certain individuals gaining great power. However, Zoats are known to rebel against the Tyranids, though rarely. The rarity of these rebellions is due to the Tyranids secreting a special slave-hormone, which suppresses the Zoats' natural sense of independence. However, renegade Zoats do exist throughout the galaxy, either having broken away from the Hive Fleets, or become lost during scouting missions and have broken away from the influence of the Tyranid slave hormone. Zoats who have broken away are able to develop independent civilizations and even strong psychic powers. Approximately half of renegade and independent Zoats will develop psychic powers. Independent Zoat civilizations are very diverse, with small groups isolated from each other on widely scattered planets. Other Zoats may find themselves employed as mercenaries, however rare. Eldar pirates favour Zoat mercenaries, due to Eldar antipathy to Orks and due to finding humans irksome. These mercenary Zoats, whether abandoned or escaped by or from their Tyranid masters, have little choice but to fight for whoever pays best and complains least.[3b]
Old Ones	The Old Ones were an ancient, space-faring reptilian race who had an advanced civilisation before the development of the Young Races in the current age. They are notable for being the first of all the Galaxy's sentient life[6a] as well as being the first race to cross the sea of stars, making them the oldest space-faring species in the Galaxy. The Old Ones are said to have had a slow, cold-blooded wisdom, studying the stars and raising astrology and astronomy to an arcane science. It was their understanding of the universe that allowed them to manipulate alternate dimensions and it was known that they undertook great works of psychic engineering.[1b] At some unknown point, they crafted the Webway to serve as a conduit through which they could travel to far-flung worlds without suffering from the tides of the Warp. Such was their advanced science that they had the capacity to cross vast tracts of space with a single step by way of Webway portals and through such means they managed to spread their spawn to many other places. They believed that all life was useful and they are known to have brought about the rise of numerous new species and impregnated thousands of worlds which they made their own.[1b] According to the Deceiver, the Old Ones once waged a war against the race of beings known as the C'tan. This was a conflict that the C'tan lost and in the aftermath they went into hiding in order to avoid the Old Ones' wrath.[6a] As the Old Ones passed through the cosmos, a number of younger and fiercer races developed within their wake, including the Necrontyr, who struggled in their colonisation of other worlds. During this encounter, the ultra-intelligent races of mystics known as the Old Ones were seen to have swiftly colonised other worlds with far greater ease and had an immense longevity to the point of immortality.[1b] The Necrontyr are known to have petitioned the Old Ones for the secret of eternal life but they refused.[6a] This kindled a burning hatred within the Necrontyr, whose harsh sun cursed them with diseased bodies and difficulties in colonising the stars.[1b] At this time, the Necrontyr empire was suffering from the Wars of Secession with the various Dynasties battling one another. The ruling council known as the Triarch believed that an external foe would unify their species and their enmity with the Old Ones led to them declaring war upon this ancient race. The temptation of the spoils of victory along with the secrets of immortality saw the separatist kingdoms unite, bringing about a conflict that would become known as the War in Heaven.[6a] The jealousy grew, eventually leading to the ancient Necrontyr dedicating their entire civilisation single-mindedly to the goal of the extermination of the Old Ones and their spawn.[1b]
Troth	The Troth, also known as Homo Sapien Verdantus, are a recognized strain of abhuman within the Imperium. They are restricted to the world of Verdant. According to legend, a tribal king called Nemus once ruled over a people isolated from the rest of humanity in the time before the Great Crusade. It is said that Nemus swore an oath to protect his world of Verdant if the planet would protect his people. As a result, Nemus' descendants, the Troth, share a symbiotic relationship with the forests of their homeworld that enables them to "converge" with their environment and confound invaders. Over many centuries, the Troth have supposedly been transformed into beings with flesh as tough as oak and digestive systems that can extract nutrients from the earth.
Aenos	The Aenos are a Xenos species.
Neandor	The Neandors, also known as Homo Sapien Hyannothus, are a recognized strain of abhuman within the Imperium. They are restricted to the world of Hyannoth IV. Neandors are a regressed strain of humans which were "created" due to a lack of "oversight" by their high-born masters. Primitive, these lowbrow savages serve little purpose other than being used for their physical strength. They have limited language and intellect, but some Imperial commanders have found that their brute strength can be used to free up more quick-witted troops for combat duties.
Ak'Haireth	The Ak'Haireth or Bone Drinkers, were a fungoid Xenos species that was a bane to the Imperium during the Great Crusade. These parasitic sentient lifeforms who operated as psychically interwoven gestalt Blooms, and sustained themselves by slowly and agonizingly feeding on any animal life. Human bone marrow in particular was a favourite target. The species operated at the edge of Segmentum Solar, inhabiting scavenged ships of other species and raiding isolated colonies and Feral Worlds to feed on unprepared populations. They were also a threat to the early human settlers of the Askellon Sector. The Ak'Haireth were resilient and able to always return despite genocidal campaigns by the Space Wolves and Night Lords. However in the Hunting of the Ak'Haireth, Alpharius and the Alpha Legion were able to deploy a deadly biological weapon and drive the species to extinction.
Barghesi	The Barghesi, also spelt Bhargesi, are an alien race known for being 'hyper-violent' that inhabits the Grendl Stars constellation in the Eastern Fringe. They are described as having red eyes, tough hide and sharp claws. Imperial wars against the Barghesi date back to at least the Great Crusade, where the horrific beasts almost destroyed an entire Brotherhood of White Scars, the Brotherhood of the Foresworn. The Emperor's Children, including Fulgrim and Fabius Bile, also fought with these beasts. According to Imperial records, the Iron Lords Space Marine Chapter proved instrumental in confining the Barghesi to the Grendl Stars, and also in preventing the destructive biological potential of the species from being harvested by Hive Fleet Kraken.
Mandrake	A Mandrake is a type of Drukhari native to the region of Commorragh known as Aelindrach. Mandrakes are often cannibalistic and wild, living separate from other Drukhari.[1a] A Mandrake's physique has adapted to make himself or herself camouflaged almost anywhere. They have evolved the so-called shadow-skin, which makes them nigh-invisible out of direct light. They also exist within a different reality itself and are capable of entering into reality straight out of another person's shadow. No-one knows how this dramatic change has occurred, not even their Drukhari kin. While the shadowskin could be just the result of warp exposure, other theories exist. Some consider them to be the very shadows brought to life, while others claim that Mandrakes are the descendants of a forbidden cult that found a way to pass into shadow to avoid the Fall, yet other rumors tell of a union between Eldar and Unholy Entities created when the Eldar Empire was at it's most decadent. Other rumors hold that the first Mandrakes were created by Haemonculi employed by the Wych Cult of Grief.
Basemekanic	The Basemekanic are vast Xenos beasts, that have thick metallic hides. Several of the creatures invaded and subjugated Gamma-Incunablar during the Great Crusade, but they were later destroyed by the Third Legion and the 43rd Veradan Solar Auxilia.
Dharlok	The Dharlok were a Xenos species. The last of their kind was exterminated by the Rogue Trader Elucia Vhane.
Donorian Fiend	Donorian Fiend are a race of possible Webway or Warp-inhabiting Xenos. After Tech-Priests on Graia breached a strange portal on Mount Laochan, they triggered a devastating invasion by the creatures which caused the Forge World to be relocated.
Caryatid	Caryatids are small, winged, blue humanoid creatures which infest the many air-ducts and vents throughout Necromunda's hives in great numbers.[1b] Caryatids are seen as good luck charms by many hivers, as they tend to attach themselves to charismatic, powerful and successful individuals: for example, very successful gang leaders and their henchmen are often attended by several Caryatids and Necromunda's Planetary Governor Lord Helmawr was known to have at least one named Blinky.[1a] Mildly psychic, they are particularly attracted to the soon-to-become-powerful and can penetrate human minds, usefully recognizing malicious intentions against their companions (and sometimes even fighting alongside those they latch onto.[3a] Although they are a sign of good fortune of those they adopt, an individual whose 'pet' caryatid leaves them is regarded as waiting for death, as the departure is seen as an omen of doom.[1b]
Arachen	The Arachen are an alien species. In 896.M40, they rejected an appeal by the Golden Ambassador to join the Tau Empire, instead driving the Tau from their territory. What followed was a brutal multi-year conflict known as the Veil War, as the Tau and Arachen fought for control of the Western Veil. Ultimately, a young Commander Farsight was able to assassinate the Arachen leadership, known as the Arachen Trinity as Commander Dawnstone was launching a final offensive. The plan worked, and the Arachen were driven from the Western Veil forever. Male Arachen are noted for having blade-like legs and were capable of fighting with bizarre but deadly martial arts, and they traveled through space in cocoon-like ships. Their nest-cities were designed as mazes, which made fighting through them extremely difficult.
Drahken	Drahkens are a species of xenos living very close to human colonists on the planet Tabius Rasa (in the Charon Stars, near the Hadex Anomaly). Drahkens are a six-limbed, reptilian species that grow up to a metre in body length with a longer tail. They are sentient and actively communicate with humans. The origins of the xenos are unclear. Records of the system from the Jericho Sector era do not identify any sapient or even protosapient species. Warp contamination could have induced a metamorphosis in a native life form, but there are few signs of contamination among the human population. Alternatively, it could be that Drahkens are not native to the Tabius Rasa system. If that is the case, they might be colonising the planet as well, though the absence of any indications of spaceflight fail to support this theory. The peculiar environment of Tabius Rasa (oceans high in phosphates and potassium salts, four moons, surface winds frequently exceeding 150 km/h, very small amount of minerals and no surface plants harvestable for foodstuffs/hardwoods) has made many scholars question the way the colony had survived with small resources and no technology of note.
Hive Mind	The Hive Mind is the gestalt collective consciousness of the entire Tyranid race, a psychic embodiment of the Tyranid instincts and racial imperatives to devour and destroy. The Hive Mind is not a single mind capable of small, conscious thought the way a human's mind works, but instead it is a grand agglomeration created from the psychic presence of untold billions of Tyranid creatures. It is a nightmarish and unfathomable intelligence that allows Tyranids to coordinate and adapt as if every Tyranid creature is merely a part of a single massive organism, one which is utterly focused on consuming all other life. The psychic presence of the Hive Mind is so powerful that it radiates out of Tyranids like a flood. This permeating psychic power on the gigantic scale of a Hive Fleet distorts the Warp for light years around the fleet's position, preventing Imperial Astropaths from sending or receiving telepathic messages, stopping spacecraft entering the Warp and forcing spacecraft already in the Warp wildly off-course as Warp travel becomes increasingly unpredictable. This invasive "Shadow in the Warp" sows terror and confusion on prey worlds as it traps and prevents the doomed inhabitants from calling for assistance. It even penetrates into the minds of nearby creatures and manifests as a primal malaise that can never be expelled. If a creature has psychic potential, the horror they feel is magnified tenfold and using their psychic abilities could drive them into incurable insanity. As a Hive Fleet approaches a target planet, whole populations will plunge into madness and despair even before the first Tyranids have made planetfall.
Djarlik	The Djarlik are a former client race of the Yu'vath. The Djarlik were aquatic xenos and spent generations practising three-dimensional combat. This made their transition into void warfare smooth and intuitive, and the Djarlik proved themselves to be expert pilots and tacticians. During the Angevin Crusade the Inquisition deemed them a threat and the species was purged. There are no known remaining Djarlik and their eradication is one of the many successes linked with the Crusade.
Enslaver	Call them what you will — Krell, Psyrens or Enslavers. Just one witch, unsanctioned, caused the destruction of Hive Skorpios when one of those things used her brain as a gateway to this world. Within three days the entire hive’s population was reduced to drooling mindslaves. Within three weeks an entire continent was at war. And all because the governor thought his family should be exempt from the psyker cull and refused to give his daughter to the Black Ships.— Inquisitor Mallen, Ordo Xenos The Enslavers, also known as Psyrens, Krell, dominators or puppeteers, are entities that are native to the Warp. The history of the Enslavers is traced to the War in Heaven that was fought millions of years ago between the C'tan-led Necrons and the Old Ones, along with their successor races. In this era, the Old Ones had engineered a number of species with a strong connection to the Warp to serve as warrior races of Psykers against their enemy. The growing pains of these Young Races disturbed the peaceful Empyrean, turning it into a hellish environment filled with now-deadly Warp predators.
Draethri	The Draethri are a xenos race. The Draethri Pain Gauntlet, which often takes the form of a whip or gauntlet, but can appear as a myriad of other shapes is a torture device, that connects to the target's nervous system, and overloads it with pain.
Clawed fiend	The Clawed Fiends are an alien species, originating from the Donorian Sector These semi-sentient monsters care nothing for civilisation or war, only for their animalistic instincts of consuming prey. They are hulking monsters of muscle and fur with incredible senses capable of perceiving multiple spectrums at once, and are known to be at their most dangerous state after having been wounded as the scent of their own bleeding ichor sends them into a berserk fury that few warriors will be quick enough to escape. Clawed Fiends are made use of by the Dark Eldar, as long ago the Webway Portal leading into the Donorian system was destroyed by the force of a Warp Storm, splitting the portal apart and allowing Clawed Fiends to enter and infest the adjacent Webway tunnels. Since then they have become one of the main creatures used by Beastmasters, who capture them for bloody hunts in the gladiatorial Wych arenas of Commorragh or for use as war-beasts in Real Space raids.
Felinid	Felinids (Homo sapiens hirsutus), are a recognized strain of abhuman within the Imperium. They are primarily known as being native to the world of Carlos McConnell. Considered a rarity outside their world, few have seen them, and there are known con men who sell supposed felinid remains which turn out to be human carcasses stitched with animal skins. Xenologist Janus Draik recorded a discussion with Kroot Mercenary Dahyak Grekh in which the Kroot described felinids as cool in the face of the most brutal opposition and as some of the most efficient killers in an Astra Militarum regiment. However, he ultimately found it difficult to distinguish one human from another, and as such, felinids, to Kroot eyes, looked no different from the rest of humanity. At the mention of felinids possessing claws the length of a human forearm, the interviewer disregarded the whole statement as coming from an unreliable source.
Cyranax Watchers	The Cyranax Watchers are a xenos race with terrible viral weaponry, capable of scourging entire worlds of their populations.
Cell-Kin	The Cell-Kin are a minor Xenos species of the Technetium Belt that came into conflict against the Subjugators Chapter in a protracted campaign. The unique reproductive cycle of the species made their complete eradication very difficult to achieve. The Cell-Kin reproduce by viral dissemination, their DNA infecting the body of another creature where it would literally reshape the host in its own image. The Space Marines' enhanced genetic make-up proved largely resilient to this thread, but twenty of the brethren of the third company were lost in the early stages of the campaign, they were slowly mutated into new, hideous forms, leading to permanent metamorphosis, ramdom mutations or more subtle but equally damaging changes. The Chapter's Apothecaries identified the threat, but they were to late to save the Battle-Brothers affected by the Cell-Kin's infection. The infected brethren that survived the conflict escaped, and are assumed to be at large in the galaxy to this day.
Antedil	The Antedil are a race of the galaxy. These beings appear no larger than an Astartes' palm, and resemble a seven-fingered hand with no thumb. Antedils are psychic beings who possess empathic powers that not even a Primarch can block. Their appearance and abilities are a result of their gas giant homeworld far in the galactic north, where crushing gravity made normal limbs and sensory abilities impossible. Outside of their homeworld, Antedils house themselves in floating orbs that contain artificial atmospheres.
Adarnian	The Adarnian were a Xenos species that were discovered by the Imperium, during the Great Crusade. However they were decreed to be harmless and were allowed to live under an Imperial protectorate. Unfortunately for the Adarnian, though, their genetic makeup was soon discovered to have miraculous restorative effects on Humans, when their bodies were rendered down to a fluid. This elixir, which was injected into the bloodstream, became the last resort for Humans, when all other Rejuvenats had failed and the Adarnian were soon harvested to extinction. There were three draw backs from using the Adarnian's genetic material, though. The first was the intense pain the elixir caused its users, while it restored their bodies. The second and third were more detrimental, however, as the youth brought about by the elixir was only temporary and afterwards left the user's body in an even more decrepit state. Currently, the elixir has not been available for ten millennia, since the Adarnian are extinct and no one was able to synthesise the species' genetic material.
Delq	The Delq are a sapient xenos species that clashed with the Imperium's forces on Karkhemish Secundus in M42. The species later successfully forced the Imperials to retreat from the world.
Autochthonar	The Autochthonar was the ancient progenitor of the Khrave species, who once ruled over them.[1a] It was originally a Psychic weapon created by an advance Xenos civilization, to spread anguish and terror amongst sentient species. In time, the Autochthonar learned to reproduce, giving birth to the Khrave and an immense psychic network that connected them all together. This grew with each new Khrave born and the Autochthonar would go on to outlive its long-forgotten creators and thrive in a galaxy ripe with chaos and strife. Even as the Khrave began using their Psychic powers to dominate other species, and built an empire of thralls, the Autochthonar ruled over them all, through their psychic network and each Khrave answered to its will.[1a] The Khrave's predations continued during the Imperium's Great Crusade and among the worlds they attacked was Muspel. Using their immense psychic powers they began slowly dominating the world's population. They would then later use these thralls to begin upheavals and rebellions to gain control of Muspel, during the Ullanor Crusade. This drew the attention of the Dark Angels Primarch Lion El'Jonson, who led a portion of his Legion and other Imperial forces to investigate the matter. When they arrived, the Khrave began to immediately attack them with their thralls and created new ones by psychically dominating non-Dark Angel members of the Primarch's fleet[1b]. The Legion held firm, though, and the Xenos were forced to step up their efforts to kill the Dark Angels. This resulted in the Khrave investing much of their psychic powers into individual thralls and turning them into Khrave-Hosts. While this gave the Khrave a powerful thrall to perfectly control, it put them in danger as once the Host died, the Khrave died as well. This led to the deaths of several Khrave at the Dark Angels' hands[1c], which weakened their psychic network and damaged the Autochthonar. In response, the Khrave's ruler led a large fleet towards Muspel, from their homeworld within the Ghoul Stars, in order to finally end the battle and destroy the Dark Angels. However the Primarch El'Jonson learned of this, after the Khrave-Host that was once the Remembrancer Savine Grael attempted to psychically dominate him. The attack backfired, as the Primarch's mental strength was too much for her[1d] and as she died[1e], the Primarch gazed into her memories and the psychic network the Khrave shared. Through this, he not only learned of every Khrave's location, but also that the Autochthonar was leading a fleet to Muspel[1d]. El'Jonson had suspected the Khrave were responsible for the predations of Humans near the Ghoul Stars and had in fact come to Muspel knowing the Xenos were behind the world's rebellions. He had planned to lure them out so the Dark Angels could destroy them, but had kept that information to himself and a select few others. In doing so, El'Jonson had prevented the Khrave from learning anything when they gazed at the memories of the non-Dark Angels they psychically dominated among the Primarch's fleet. This allowed El'Jonson to safely enact his plans to finally end their threat to the Imperium and Mankind.[1f]
Argonite	The Argonite are a minor xenos species named after the Rogue Trader who first found one of their derelict vessels drifting through space. The ships were monochromatic, suggesting that the Argonites' vision is not comparable to humans. Their homeworld has yet to be discovered. On the Argonite ship a weapon now called the Argonite Whistler was discovered. The weapon appears as a grey rod with a handgrip. When pressure is applied to the rod, different tones emanate. It was discovered by Magi-Xenologists that when a greater force is applied to the rod it will fire a tightly focused sonic beam.
Drahendra	The Drahendra were one of the Xenos races comprising the Cabal. Their bodies were made from sentient, energised dust and they lived on dying gas giants, forming membranous skins around them. Their intellects were inscrutable even to other Cabal races, perceiving the universe very slowly. As a race, they were almost extinct by the last years of the Great Crusade, at the time the Horus Heresy began to unfold.
Fra'al	The Fra'al are believed both to have an empire[3a] and to be nomadic. Occasionally sighted in the Gothic Sector (including the Bhein Morr Subsector as raiders in early M41,[3b] and during the Gothic War by the Mars Class Battlecruiser Marquis Lex on anti-pirate patrols of the Hammerhead Deeps and across the Quinrox Sound), the neighbouring Tamahl Sector and the Osiris Cluster (in M40), their empire is thought to be based in Segmentum Obscurus.[3a] While their empire includes planets which they protect and an organisational system including Satraps (local rulers) who are known to have traded with the Imperium on occasion (probably mostly indirectly through Rogue Traders in the Cold Trade, greedily selling secrets and even human slaves for Fra'al technology), they are better known as raiders, attacking various convoys and systems. The Imperial Navy chases down and engages Fra'al raiders on anti-pirate patrols and in fleet actions,[3b] though the Fra'al agenda on these raids remain obscure. Little Fra'al technology is known to or understood by the Imperium, with what has been traded described by the Fra'al Satrap Master Vray as “mere trinkets and toys... the least of our crafts”. One of the main advances which the Fra'al have over other races is that of Ether technology, the basis of the deadly Ether Cannons of their Battlecruisers which fire a pulsed energy beam at the enemy ship, causing an Ether field which corrodes the enemy hull, ignoring and even overloading void shields and Eldar holo-fields; Tech-priest Hieronomus Tezla “won great renown amongst his fellows for his audacious examination of a crashed Fra'al spacecraft in the Tamahl sector and his subsequent etheric-plasma theorums”.
Vampyre	Vampyres are nocturnal bloodsucking humanoids known to exist on Necromunda. Their origin is unknown but they most likely represent yet another semi-stable mutation of humanity. They are considered by many to be ancient fables from Terra used to frighten children, but only a select few are aware of these creatures. They are thought to be in league with Chaos and the threat they pose to mankind is considered high. Despite ninety-nine percent of the population of Necromunda not knowing about them, they are considered a dangerous form of Wyrd and the bounties on their head correspond to those of other Outlaws. The Inquisition has been investigating outbreaks of vampyrism for centuries and only recently have they found an enclave on Necromunda. They have decided to quietly stop them from escaping and infecting other worlds as they could easily escape in space through one of the world's main shipping lines.
Bale Childer	The Bale Childer were a xenos race or entity defeated in the Angevin Crusade along with the Yu'vath, after both their homeworlds were destroyed by Exterminatus. They were the last resistance to Imperial rule in the Calyx Expanse, which signaled the end of the Angevin Crusade and the birth of the Calixis Sector.
Demos	The Demos are a mind-eating Xeno species that were defeated by the Imperium. After the Badab War, Ordo Xenos Inquisitor Parnival Gründvald described that the Imperium had defeated "the mind-eating Demos", among many other Xenos and other threats.
Poctroon	The Poctroon were a xenos species that are notable for being the first sentient race to join the T'au Empire in 893.M37. However, within a few generations, disease destroyed the indigenous population. The T'au, who were immune to the plague, inherited the Poctroons' homeworld, renaming it Bork'an and turning it into a prime world.
Elquon	The Elquon are a Xenos species, whose physical appearance is described as being a mixture of Human and Canine characteristics.
Delaque (Xenos Species)	The Delaque are an extinct aquatic xenos species that existed on Necromunda long before the world was claimed by humans. In Necromunda's ancient history, it was covered in oceans and was filled with aquatic monsters. Some of these creatures were so grand, that the world's lesser sentient Xenos species worshiped them as gods. The Delaque were among them and they called these grand monsters the Silent Ones. After thousands of years, however, an unknown calamity caused Necromunda's oceans to be swallowed by the world. This caused the world's lesser species to begin dying off and even the Silent Ones felt their death approaching. The Delaque though, were not content to let themselves or their Gods die. They discovered as Necromunda's oceans sank, great underground seas were created close to the world's core. Being more cunning than most of Necromunda's species, the Delaque sought to save the Silent Ones by building a city for them in the underground seas. As their world died around them, the Delaque completed the city and then saw the Silent Ones to their slumber within it. Afterwards, they returned to Necromunda's drying surface and made their own plans for achieving immortality. They would succeed by creating the psychic Psychoterica devices, which held their gestalt consciousness. The Psychoterica were also linked to the minds of the Silent Ones and many of the devices were created. Each, though, still shared a link to the Delaque and Silent Ones. Then with their goals complete, the Delaque and all of Necromunda's sentient species died. Millions of years passed, until humans discovered Necromunda and set foot upon its surface. The saw a world worth colonizing and were oblivious that it once held, oceans and sentient species. This would begin the rise of the current age of Necromunda and Hive Primus would be built over the slumbering Silent Ones' city. Thousands of years later, the Imperium would claim the world during the Great Crusade. Then in 876.M36, a plague of dream sickness struck Necromunda, after the rogue world Somnus closely passed its orbit. Some speculate that Somnus's passing weakened the veil of reality to the Warp, where the sickness could have come from. The dream sickness caused the infected to see visions and they began to hear voices when they were awake. This led a small number of Hive Primus's population to eventually leave their homes and travel to its Underhive. They did so to find something there, and when at last the plague went away, a whole group of infected people had gathered together. Though they had all come from various stations in life, it felt as if they somehow all knew each other. They eventually found the Psychoterica and were forever changed, as they became permanently linked to the Delaque's gestalt consciousness. In the years to come, they would be joined by thousands of others who had seen the dream sickness's visions as well. These people eventually became House Delaque, and the visions that brought them to the Psychoterica had been sent across time and space by the original Delaque Xenos. Somehow a form of House Delaque's true history became known outside of the House as the tale of the Drowned Empire. According to the end of the tale, when the time is right, House Delaque will travel to the city of their gods and finally awaken the Silent Ones. However, to those who hear the story, it is just one of the many possible origins that Necromunda's population has given to the mysterious Delaque.
Cryptosi	The Cryptosi were an exotic meta-dimensional Xeno species that came into conflict with the Imperium, after attacking several of its colony worlds, during The Great Crusade. What became of the Cryptosi after a Sub-Company of the Alpha Legion was sent to investigate the atrocities they committed is unknown; though the Imperium soon lost contact with the colony worlds they attacked, due to the actions of the Legiones Astartes.
Deeper (Mutants)	The Deeper are mutants that dwell in the depths of Necromunda's Hive Primus.[1a] They are originally descended from foolish homesteaders who tried to make a life in the fungal depths of the hive's bottom. Mere centuries later, that environment changed them so that the Deeper now have[1a] hairless ratlike skulls[1b], skin the color of pus[1a], and black eyes[1b] that look like lumen globes, and they are also both taller and thinner than other mutants. They have since become a stable strain of mutation, but are not yet classified by the Imperium as being abhuman.[1a]
Akvrani	The Akvrani are an extinct Xenos species that once dwelled within the Askellon Sector. Scant records about the species remain, to the point that Askellian scholars debate whether their annihilation occurred before or during the Sector's Imperial Compliance. A small amount of the Akvrani's artefacts remain, however, with the Akvran Cutter grenades being the most common.
Chikanti	The Chikanti are a sentient Xenos species.[1a] They are described as being squat, barrel-shaped biped creatures with four arms, mottled brown skin[1a] and lip-less[1b] fish-like heads. The Chikanti also have moist eyes[1a], flat noses, double rows of wide teeth and big, flat feet that have fringes of toes running most of the way around them[1b]. They have voices that sound like broken rocks[1a] and their society has a pantheon of gods.[1c]
Vampires	Vampires are polymorphic creatures that are native to the Warp. These entities do not hold a homeworld and the reasons for their evolution into a parasitic existence within alien societies is unknown. They became entrenched within legends on Old Earth and were later regarded as being discredited myths as well as legends. However, in reality, their existence was real and they were known to infiltrate societies where they masqueraded as their chosen race and sought positions of power. At some point, a Warp-spawned Vampire had risen into power on the Hive World Cephian IV. The Black Templars were known to have battled the creatures, with Helbrecht slaying the entity with this act seeing him inducted into the ranks of the Sword Brethren. The natural form of a vampire is a humanoid bat-shaped creature. However, they are able to alter their metabolism to mimic the races that they live amongst thus allowing them to blend into their surroundings. As they live in the manner of their chosen race, a vampire is not easily singled out by the societies they have infiltrated. Vampires are known to possess psychic powers that are comparable to Humans and maintain their existence by absorbing the lifeforce of other creatures. They are able to drain this energy through prolonged physical contact though are able to gain some sustenance from normal food or drink. Completely drained victims become something like zombies under Vampire control. By nature, vampires are known to crave power among intelligent races and even regard other members of their kind as a rival thus making them a threat.
Caradochian	The Caradochian are members of a fickle, winged race that sell their services to the highest bidder.
Thesstrian Flesh-takers	The Thesstrian Flesh-takers are a Xenos species.
Gaanerth Pact	The Gaanerth Pact are a Xenos civilization living under Eldar protection in the Laevenir Archipelago. The race is known to have a caste society consisting of commanders, slaves, and various "wartypes" which include designations such as 'Bloodlashers', 'Sagitus', 'Venox', and 'Aspus'. These forces are divided into units known as Clews, Blooms, and Devotions. They are currently engaging the Tyranids in War Zone Laevenir.
Nightsider	Nightsiders (Homo Sapiens Tenebris), are a strain of Abhuman found in the Imperium. Having evolved on worlds or parts of planets shrouded in darkness, Nightsiders have a variety of particular attributes including echolocation, tapetal reflexes which allow them to see almost in total darkness, chemiluminescence which enable them to "glow", and heightened olfactory and auditory senses. As a result, they are sometimes used in Imperial Guard Regiments for use during underground or night operations. However their physical attributes (including oversized eyes to no eyes at all, colourless or transparent skin, luminous appendages, etc.) have made them reviled and mistrusted by the very people they seek to serve.
Genestealer Hybrid	A Genestealer Hybrid is any being infested by a Genestealer or the progeny of such an individual. When infected by a Genestealer, a person's offspring are hybrids with dominant Genestealer traits. These hybrids can infect others, continuing the cycle until the fourth generation, when they appear almost entirely Human. Fourth-generation hybrids reproduce normally but can give birth to Humans, hybrids, or purestrain Genestealers. Alarmingly, Human parents seem unaware of their children's monstrous nature, possibly due to psychic influence. Genestealers are formidable enemies, as a single one can initiate an infection that spreads rapidly, threatening entire races. Purestrain Genestealers cannot use tools due to mental limitations, but their hybrid descendants, particularly later generations, can use weapons and equipment, making them even more dangerous.
Barasonilash	The Barasonilash are a sentient Xenos species of four-armed bipeds with short legs, six eyes and a gill-like slit in place of a nose. Their existence may also predate the origins of the Aeldari, making them possibly among the oldest sentient species known to exist. This theory was concocted by the Rogue Trader and Xenologist Janus Draik, who discovered the Barasonilash were referenced in both Aeldari and Imperial sources. These include several translated ancient Aeldari myths and legends that refer to wars and events that predate their own origins, while the Imperial Xenographia Universalis contains reports of Adeptus Mechanicus Explorator Fleets that encountered Barasonilash Seers. Given the similarity in the description given of the Barasonilash in both Aeldari and Imperial sources, Draik is inclined to believe they are the same species. However if this is true, the Barasonilash may have since gone extinct, as Draik has been unable to find recent records of any encounters with the species.
Cryptos	The Cryptos are a Xenos race. They appear as a strange gaseous cloud with an eerie greenish glow filled with half-formed shapes, without solid physical shape and able to pass through solid matter, and they are able to take human bodies as hosts.
Cimmeriac	The Cimmeriac were a xenos race that fought Hive Fleet Jormungandr at the side of High Admiral Vortigern Hanroth with their ships, Cimmeriac Shadowcruisers. Their civilization was destroyed less than five years later by the same High Admiral.
Scalies	Scalies are a mutant strain of abhuman found in the underhive which have stabilised over time, although there is still a lot of variation, and are not as stable as other abhumans found in the Imperium, like Ogryns, Ratlings, and Squats.[1a] Scalies are massive reptilian mutants almost as broad as they are tall. Their durability and strength are legendary among the people of the Underhive and have a fearsome reputation. Like some reptiles they have the ability to regenerate lost limbs and their thick skin acts as a natural armour.[1a] They are rarely seen but they are at their most numerous in the Underhives of Necromunda. They are undoubtedly intelligent but seldom speak due to their twisted mutated necks and voice boxes having changed beyond the ability of normal human speech. Very little is known about their origins or if there are hidden clans or tribes of Scalies in the most severely polluted badzones in the Underhive. They are mainly found in the employ of Scavvies. Why they choose to work along side them is unknown. No Scavvie Boss or King worth his salt will be seen without one or two Scalies in their gang.[1a]
Drepanes	Drepanes are an abhuman strain hailing from the world of Azetium IV. They are known to have ‘sickle-like’ heads.
Elohim (Species)	The Elohim were a mysterious xenos species that once inhabited, among other worlds, the planet Aghoru. In the legends of the Aghoru people, the Elohim evolved their forms to such perfect physical beauty that they fell in love with their own appearances. They had the ability to change the forms of plants, thus allowing them to build enormous organic constructs, scattered around their vast empire of worlds.[1d] Having attained such power they devoted their lives to hedonism and the exploration of pleasure. Eventually, the powers they harnessed in pursuit of these pleasures turned on them, and led to the almost-instantaneous and nearly-complete extinction of their race.[1d]
Ecto-Saurids	The Ecto-Saurids were a Xeno species that were driven to extinction, when their Homeworld of Verikhonia was invaded by the Iron Warriors Legion during The Great Crusade.
Empothanes	The Empothanes are a Xenos species that has clashed with the Imperium.
Exodite	The Exodites are the Eldar who abandoned their homeworlds before the Fall, establishing new cities on Maiden Worlds of the Eldar Empire in order to escape the growing decadence of their civilization. Protected from Slaanesh's predation by their World Spirit, they purposefully live a physically rigorous life[2a], expressing the intensity of their Aeldari nature through a powerful loyalty to their clans and a strong determination to acheive the clan's objectives. They are known for the martial superiority of their Dragon Knights. Beginning in M30 as the Eldar Empire neared its Fall, the degeneration of Eldar society leading to the Fall did not go wholly without resistance. Far-sighted individuals began to criticize the decadence of their citizens and warn against the newly formed cults[2b] and the abandonment of the Eldar Gods. Mostly ignored or else treated as narrow-minded fools and fanatics by their fellow citizens, as society collapsed they became resolute that this would be a decline without end.[2b] They were the ones still untainted by the touch of Chaos, and by now they were few. They would form a new group of doomsayers and survivalists, deciding to leave the Eldar worlds and settle planets far from Eldar civilization among the Lilaethan, the Maiden Worlds[2b] seeded at the height of the empire by Turella Dandramensha Dominion Genesis ships, abandoning their homeworlds in a series of migrations called the Exodus[2b] and for their exodus they were named Exodites. The first Exodites would launch from Hiron-athela and assortment of spacecraft would follow, including Craftworlds built from the habitat towers, domes, and Webway pylons that would become the foundation of new cities. The Exodites would also bring with them the tremendous war-machines of the Eldar Knights. The Exodites travelled far away from their collapsing civilization, mostly eastward, settling many, often harsh, worlds – a place of safety (for most) beyond the psychic implosion that would wipe out most of the Eldar race and its empire[2b] in M31.
Draxian	The Draxian are a race of aliens that form part of the Draxian Hegemony, a fledgling empire that's beginning to conquer Imperial space.
Spinedorians	The Spinedorians are one of the minor alien races of a galaxy. A cluster of this race lived on the planet Urk in the period between the Dark Age of Technology and the Great Crusade.
Malgreth	The Malgreth are a Xenos species. Sightings of malgreth are known to fall within the remit of the Deathwatch to investigate.
Enoulians	The Enoulians are a race of humanoids believed to have originated from the Halo Stars but are occasionally encountered in the Calixis Sector. Enoulians are smaller than baseline humans, being on average 1.5m tall with a slight build. They also have yellow skin that exudes a lubricating material that allows them to slip free from any attempt to capture them. They do not have externally developed ears or noses like other humanoid creatures such as Humans or Eldar instead having simple slits where those organs should be.
Galthite	The Galthite are a saurian Xenos species from the Oenorian Inner Systems. They are the creators of the Galthite lacerator, a fist-like weapon capable of rending flesh with ease. Similiarly, Siege Claws used by Chaos Decimators are noted to resemble certain blades used by the Galthite serrator-assissins. In one of wars, the Red Talons Chapter and their Contemptor Dreadnought Skara Brae fought with this race. Some of the species, also joined the Warband of the Dragon Warriors Sorcerer Lord Nihilan and took part in his invasion of the Salamanders' Homeworld Nocturne.
Breg-shei	The Breg-shei were a Xenos species that lived on the planet Farinatus Maximus. This world was the scene of a joint campaign during the Great Crusade by the Raven Guard and Night Lords. This campaign is called the Farinatus Extermination. Millennia later, Imperial colonists on Regnan Impri were terrorised by Breg-shei. In response, Iron Hands pursued the Breg-shei through Regnan Magna's rings and moons. On Regnan Drey, the Breg-shei conducted an ambush by laying in wait in cyst-nests under the regolith. The Breg-shei were described as insectoid in apparence with metal maws and long sharp stabbing appendages. They lived in something called "sanctuary-nests" and operated as a hivemind.
Longshank	The Longshanks, also known as Homo Sapien Elongatus, are a recognized strain of abhuman within the Imperium Longshanks are unnaturally tall abhumans who reside on worlds with low levels of gravity. In appearance, the Longshanks are bald with very pronounced eyes and have unnaturally long legs when compared with baseline humans.[2a] Longshanks serve in a variety of Auxilia Regiments of the Imperial Guard, where they tower over others like giants. When heavily armed and armoured, they can make an imposing sight, while their long strides allow them to cross difficult terrain at great speed. However, their lofty height makes them easy targets for enemy fire.
Chromes	The Chromes were a race of metallic insectoid Xenos encountered by the Imperium in M32.[1a] Their total numbers were estimated as near 88 billions[1b] and they have been encountered on sixty-seven worlds (including Ardamantua). According to Magos Biologis investigations Chromes were not harmless, but also not a naturally aggressive species. This Xenos species was called "Chromes" because of the silvery metallic finish of their chitin armour.[1c] In appearance, they resembled human-sized insects with impressive speed and long forelimbs. They were armoured around their heads, necks and backs, and made noises compared to broken cogitators.[1c]
Lok'kroll	The Lok'kroll were a Xenos race inhabiting regions of Ultima Segmentum, specifically near the Storm of the Emperor's Wrath. Over the centuries, the Lok'kroll had carved out their own empire and were a plague upon Imperial colonists and mining outposts in the area. Described as hulking invertebrates, the entire race was wiped out in the Lok'kroll Xenocide in 119.M37. The genocidal campaign was led by the Novamarines.
Jehangir	The Jehangir are a savage Xenos species, that terrorized the Teras of Piruz region and the Cowled Wardens Chapter was nominally tasked with purging them. However, sometime after the Dark Angels' Primarch Lion El'Jonson awoke in M42, he led the Successor Chapter to a final victory over the Xenos.
Khoasps	The Khoasps are a Xenos species.
Cythor Fiends	The Cythor Fiends (classisfied as Homindae crystallis by the Imperium) are a mysterious Xenos race that previously inhabited the Ghoul Stars. The Cythors have spindly limbs and vile faces, elongated and inhuman. They live in the fortresses with sheer walls of glimmering crystal and used some uncanny weapons. According to the Death Spectres, the Cythors are not alive in the sense humans would understand it. Cythor Fiends use small silver discs that when activated causes them to shatter apart and reform into deadly crystals that quickly slash the throats of their victims. These mobile crystals can become quite small, and seemingly possess the essence of the Fiend. In addition, the Cythors employ unique warships, with one known class being the Pinion Class Stealth Frigate.
Dracolith	The Dracolith are a race of crystalline aliens, that form part of the Church of Dracolith, a fledgling empire that is beginning to conquer Imperial space. The Dracolith were at one point found in the Askellon Sector before they were driven out by the Imperium many centuries ago. One of their weapons, the crystralline projector, shares characteristics with the Decimator Stormlaser encouraging theories within the Inquisition of hybridisation.
Phenaem	The Phenaem are a Xenos species, that build tunnel structures that contain hydrogen-rich vents. The 3rd Saturnyne Rams of the Solar Auxilia, later used that against the Xenos on Hekrun, during the Great Crusade, by using Volkite weaponry to ignite the vents. The resulting explosions not only completely destroyed the Xenos structures, but also killed all of the Phenaem that dwelled within them.
Tanaril	The Tanaril are nightmarish Xenos who fought the Ultramarines Legion during the Great Crusade.
Scandrane	The Scandrane were a Xenos species that clashed with the Imperium during the Great Crusade. Their Queen was killed in battle by the World Eaters Primarch Angron.
Ghoresh	The Ghoresh were a Xenos species, that was exterminated by the Brazen Beasts Warband.
Loxatl	Loxatl a race of sinuous, non-humanoid quadrupeds evolved from amphibian forms. They are commonly found as mercenaries in service of Blood Pact armies in the Sabbat Worlds region[2a], but they have been seen as far the Maelstrom, Jericho Reach and in the Eye of Terror. In appearance they resemble a slimy-skinned, scale-less Terran Komodo Dragon, with a broad toothy head with yellow eyes (some varieties have been encountered with red, pupil-less eyes), and a flickering purple tongue that constantly tastes the air. Their natural environment is under water - outside of water, their vision, hearing and sense of smell are impaired, and they rely on their powerful senses of taste and vibration to hunt on land, making them excellent scouts and trackers, as they can taste the presence of enemies from kilometres away and feel their location through the vibration of their heartbeat or footsteps.
Brain Boyz	The Brain Boyz are believed to be an ancient subspecies of Greenskins that are related to the Orks and were believed to be a master or ruling caste of their kind who shared a similar physique with their cousin species. Ork legend (such as it is) is generally passed down by the Runtherds. They speak of a legendary caste of greenskins who created the Orks of today. This ancient race was extremely intelligent, and held dominion over the Ork castes. They were much smaller than their servants, so they bred the Orks to be as strong and fierce as possible to protect them from predators and invaders. It was believed that this group was the driving force behind their civilisation and were responsible for developing their technology as well as directing the different castes. There is even some speculation that both Orks and Gretchins may have been specialised mutants that were deliberately created by the Brain Boyz to serve certain duties, though it believed that the truth of this will never be known for certain. Regardless, it is known that the Brain Boyz died out long ago and the Orks inherited their civilisation to the point that this ruling caste become little more than legend. According to Orkish beliefs, the Brain Boyz died from a great plague which ran across many centuries that caused their numbers to dwindle and eventually led to their extinction. It is believed that this caste was aware of their falling numbers and took steps to preserve their knowledge by engineering it into the genetic structure of their slaves. This lasting legacy allowed the Orks to retain their high level of technology in later years by way of artificial strands of DNA which contains knowledge imprinted in their metabolism that allowed the Orks to live following the demise of their masters.
Endymine Cordat	The Endymine Cordat are a Xenos species that made attempts to coexist with the Imperium. To do this, they tentatively offered the Imperium technology seen to be anathema to Daemons. In response, the Deathwatch was unleashed and the forces of three entire Watch Fortresses invaded the worlds held by the Endymine Cordat. In the end, their civilization was shattered and the Endymine Cordat's primary world was destroyed by Exterminatus. The surviving Endymine Cordat, that lived on the few worlds they still held, later devolved into a feral society and their remaining gene pools were barely large enough to stave off their extinction.
Shrive-wrack	The Shrive-wracks are a Xenos species known to inhabit Space Hulks.
Hrud	Some text passages and/or images of this article have been removed due to insufficient Citations and placed under Quarantine on this article's Discussion page until proper citations have been provided. You can help to restore them to the article by finding the correct citations and re-integrating the quarantined text and/or images as described in the Help article on citations. The Hrud (also known as the Temporaferrox[24b] and by the scientific name Troglydium hrudii) are a mysterious xenos race. Described with labels such as chronomantic[23a] and chronophagic[26b], they have the ability to manipulate the flow of time through both technological and biological means. The Imperium first encountered the Hrud during the Great Crusade.[8a] The earliest Imperial reports labeled them as the 'nocturnal warriors of Hrud', however Xenologist Janus Draik describes the Imperial records as being unclear on whether Hrud was intended as the name of their homeworld or the name of their species.
Phycene Skur	The Phycene Skur are said to be a sentient Xenos species, who have humanoid upper bodies and serpentine tails. However there is some doubt, as to whether the species truly exists. The Imperium's only known encounter with the Skur occurred, when they invaded Salhad and began butchering its nomad population. The nomads described the Xenos as having descended upon Salhad, while being bathed in holy light and that they were beautiful and wore dazzling mirrored armor. The Skur are said to have fed hungrily on the slain nomads' intestines and when wounded they leaked flames instead of blood. However the Rogue Trader and Xenologist Janus Draik, has done research on the Skur, which led him to believe they do not exist. This is because Salhad's nomads indulge in week-long fasts and mainly ingest hallucinogens when they do eat. After learning this, Draik wondered how the nomads' claims were ever taken seriously and he has declared the Skur to be nothing more than a fantasy.
Sepolcrali	The Sepolcrali are a race of worm-like Xenos encountered by the Imperium on the planet of Thermia V. They have serpentine or worm-like appearance. Most often they attack under the cover of sandstorms, like ghosts hiding in the veils of sand. When they are searching for a scent of their victims they rise up at one end of their bodies, tasting the air. However, the greatest danger - is their way of attacking. When they kill the victim with their jaws, they dissolve in the air and plunge straight down through its throat. Then after a few minutes the victim again rises to his feet, like an undead, and begins to grow, sometimes reaching a height of at least 30 feet with appropriate bulkness. The possessed victim also attacks other nearby victims grabbing them and hurling them toward the mass of other Sepolcrali so that they also possess them. This process is repeated until all the Sepolcrali and their slave vessels would be completely destroyed. On the planet of Thermia V (where the local citizens called Sepolcrali the dust worms) despite the participation of the Blood Angels and Mephiston himself, who killed a lot of Sepolcrali, the Imperium armies were forced to withdraw and left the planet to xenos.
Noisome Reek	The Reek, also known as the Noisome Reek, are a race of aliens that form part of the Worldweave of the Noisome Reek, a fledgling empire that is beginning to conquer Imperial space. Among the Reek's noted engagements with Mankind are skirmishes with members of the Arcadius dynasty of Rogue Traders. A voidswarm of Reek encountered the forces of Abad Gerrit of the Arcadius at the Battle of Ghallenburg. Abad managed to single-handedly stem the tide of the xenos' interface vessels as they made planetfall. Members of this race are known to have occupied the Si'coa system that fell under the dominion of the Tau Empire. This was until the arrival of Aun'Va who instilled within the Fire Warriors a righteous rage which they turned against the hateful Reek which led to them being eliminated at Si'coa.
C'tan	The C'tan (Eldar Yngir) are beings of pure energy that form a fundamental constant of the universe. Said to be the first beings in existence, they led the Necrons in their war against against the Old Ones before their followers turned on them and shattered most of them into shards to be used as weapons of war.[25a] It is said that the C'tan were born during the creation of the universe itself, formed of the insensate energies unleashed in the churning mass of unimaginable force. It was long before the planets first formed and cooled that the first self-aware entities emerged from the seas of plasma and solar flares. While these creatures would later be known as the C'tan, during the early stages they bore little resemblance to the terrifying entities they would later become. At these early stages they were merely monstrous parasites suckling upon the stars that bore them, shortening their lives by uncounted millennia. In time, these star vampires learned to fly on diaphanous wings of magnetic flux, leaving their birthplaces drifting to new feeding grounds. They paid no heed to solid matter for the internal fires and electromagnetism of the new-born planets were insufficient to register their on their monstrous hunger. These beings continued their benign existence with little conception of the universe until the intervention of the Necrontyr. Since the earliest times the Necrontyr had studied the stars to understand their baleful energies, seeking some power to unleash upon their bitter enemies, the Old Ones, during the War in Heaven and find a cure for their short lifespans. The Necrontyr, having been defeated by the Old Ones and scattered to the halo stars. had fallen into civil war, the second such War of Secession.[25a] It was during this period that the Necrontyr under their Silent King Szarekh[25a] had perceived anomalies in the oldest dying stars. They had discovered a sentience more ancient than any corporeal lifeform in creation; beings of pure energy in the complex skeins of etheric energy. These beings found feeding upon the solar flares and magnetic storms of bloated red giants were perceived as the progeny of the Necrontyr death-god, who would act as weapons of retribution to cast down the Old Ones. These beings would come to be known as the C'tan, Star Gods in the Necrontyr language.
Dvorgite	The Dvorgite are a sentient Xenos species that raided Imperial mining asteroids during the Nachmund Rift War. They are ferocious creatures whose blood-parties have come into conflict with other space faring races, including Craftworld Aeldari.
Sub	Subs (Homo Sapiens Deformum) are a strain of abhuman found in the Imperium. Known to be hideous to the point of being the frequent victim of Ecclesiarchy purges, Subs regularly live in constant fear for their lives. Despite this, several groups are still known to be loyal to the Imperium and seek redemption in battle. They are often useful despite their appearance, utilizing mutations that have practical uses on worlds with harsh local conditions. These Subs are known to be zealous warriors, and are far more numerous than the High Lords of Terra realize.
Slaugth	The Slaugth are a xenos race, vaguely humanoid in shape, covered in hundreds of half-melded maggot-like worms. Covered in viscous mucus, they are impervious to all but the most extreme injury. The Slaugth are believed to be impossibly ancient, likely native to the Calixis Sector long before the arrival of Mankind. Much of their known activity takes place around the region of the Hazeroth Abyss that consists of cursed space and dead stars. Their true homeworld is, however, unknown and may not be located within the Abyss.[5a] Their origins are largely unknown to the Imperium though Rogue Traders and xeno-savants believe that any empire that they hold lies far out the Trailing Halo Stars. The circumstances of the first contact between mankind and the Slaugth is unknown, though some sources claim that they have been encountered on the edge of Imperial space as far back as the Age of Strife.[1b] The abundance of humans in the galaxy has led to them becoming the favoured prey of the Slaugth. Despite this, they seem content to use infiltration and human agents to bring about their incomprehensible plans.[5a] Many of the encounters with these xenos follow the same pattern, with black, tenebrous vessels entering into Imperial space, where they wreak havoc on isolated outposts or shipping lines. The Slaugth's victims are either left behind as mutilated bodies or disappear altogether. In other encounters, the Slaugth give their vile technologies to renegade humans in exchange for slaves.[1b] Those Imperial worlds that border the Hazeroth Abyss often tell the stories describing the Slaugth as the "worms that walk", a nightmare that emerges from the depths of the Abyss to kill the living and feast on the dead. Ultimately, however, the upper echelons of the Imperium dismiss them as little more than a myth.[5a]
Tushepta	The Tushepta is a Xenos race that came into contact with the Imperium during the course of the Great Crusade.
Genestealer Patriarch	A Genestealer Patriarch is the founder and leader of a Genestealer Cult. The Patriarch is always the oldest purestrain of the cult. As the first Genestealer of the group, all other members are psychically linked through it; this leads it to attain a level of intelligence much higher than that of other Genestealers. Over time, it can become a very powerful psyker; it grows in size and strength, gaining a bloated and immobile appearance. A Patriarch whose cult is on the verge of taking over a world becomes a psychic beacon, attracting Tyranids to the planet; as the Tyranids approach it will fall under the power of the Tyranid Hive Mind, and begin leading the cult in attacks on vulnerable positions to facilitate the inevitable invasion. It is assumed that it knows nothing of its role in the Tyranid invasion, and once the Tyranids are successful, it and the brood are also consumed by the Hive Fleet. Twice the height of a Space Marine and with strength enough to slice an Ogryn into bloody chunks, this creature is a leering nightmare of tooth and claw. In a flurry of whipping limbs and diamond-hard talons the Patriarch can tear through platoons of heavily armoured warriors and even light vehicles. Yet it is the hypnotic spell with which it binds its chosen hosts that mark it out as perhaps the most dangerous Tyranid yet encountered by the Imperium. The uncanny powers of the Patriarch make it a fearsome puppet master, a threat so pervasive it has a xenocode threat designation unto itself. By spreading the Genestealer Curse, this creature is capable of destroying not just warriors and war machines, but entire worlds.
Morgauth	The Morgauth are a scavenging reptilid race of xenos, not known for their subtlety. The Morgauth Burn Caster is a hybrid weapon created from xenos and Imperial technology. The weapon is often used by pirates and renegades operating past the Fydae Great Cloud in boarding actions and has the stopping power to kill an Ork. The Burn Caster rapidly fires self-propelled thermic rounds.
Vargah	The Vargah are a Xenos species, that are psychic predators and hypnotic flesh changers, who mold and meld their prey for amusement. They have six glossy, black eyes arrayed around their mottled mouth parts and prefer to use cliff warrens to conceal themselves. In M42, the Deathwatch Captain Ghyros led a successful extermination campaign, against a large number of Vargah that infested a volcanic world.
Hullghast	Hullghasts bear extensive physical mutations. They have hairless, leathery skin, and arms ending in vicious talon-like claws. Their faces have oversized mouths filled with layers of huge teeth. Their bodies are covered pustules of flesh, which erupt in tusks and horns. Hullgasts' mutations make them highly resistant to the various environmental hazards encountered within a ship's Black Holds or in derelicts drifting through space, and they display almost total immunity to most forms of toxins, mild radiation, and gravity fluctuations. Hullghasts inhabit forgotten, abandoned decks of voidships, as well as space hulks. Unlike the furtive, scavenging Ghilliam, they are highly aggressive, and prefer feeding on crewmen that go too deep below decks; they are also known to prey on Ghilliam, although they seem to prefer the flavor of unmutated meat. When unable to do so, they feed on each other.
Agusa	The Agusa were a sentient snout-nosed Xenos species, who resided on Clabrus V and suffered repeated attacks by the Cythor Fiends. These invading Xenos' skin gives off a foetid stink that has a paralytic effect on all who come in close proximity to it. The Agusa, though, claimed that by wearing a scented poultice over their snouts, they would be able to ward off the Cythor Fiends' debilitating aroma. Because the Fiends eventually wiped out the Agusa, however, the Rogue Trader and Xenologist Janus Draik, is inclined to disregard their claims.
Ulindi	The Ulindi were a Xenos species that were wiped out by other neighboring species long before the rise of the Imperium. The Man of Iron UR-025 encountered the Ulindi prior to their extinction and described them as a moderately successful species that were tedious conversationalists.
False Necron	False Necrons are complex, artificial-intelligence-driven Necron machines, that serve as advisers to their Dynasties' ruling nobles. They are simulacra of their Dynasties' luminary Necrontyr members, who died before the C'tan converted their species into the Necron.[1a] False Necrons were leaders of their society, politicians, generals and other deceased Necrontyr that the Necrons deemed worthy of remembrance and reconstitution into machine bodies. In this way, the wisdom of the species' past was allowed to be preserved and brought to immortality. Nevertheless, the machines' Necrontyr personalities have only been approximated based on other Necron's recollections of them. As a result, there will be differing opinions on how accurate a False Necron truly is to the Necrontyr on whom it is based. As well as their thoughts and behaviours, the False Necrons' advanced programming has them mimic how their Necrontyr were perceived to have carried themselves. This leads some to forever stand proudly, while other machines remain hunched over. While False Necrons resemble their species, and are also made of Living Metal, they are clumsy and awkward in their movements. Despite knowing they are simulacra and lacking the poise of a true Necron, the machines consider themselves to be alive in a way. As a result, False Necrons will fight to protect themselves or their Dynasties, even if that means firing their ornate weapons against their fellow Necrons[1a]. Also, despite being machines, False Necrons can still be infected by the Flayer Virus.[1b] False Necrons were originally created, when the Necrons still served the C'tan, during the War in Heaven. They served their Dynasties as advisors and the mere mention of the C'tans, would cause the machines to offer sigils of their obeisance to the Star Gods. When the Necrons turned upon their former masters, the False Necrons continued in their role as advisors. However the machines were ingrained by the Necrons with engrams to prevent them from completing their sigils to the C'tan. When the Great Sleep began, the False Necrons were shut down and placed in tombs, that were located close to their Dynasties' nobles. Because they were machines, though, the False Necrons' tombs were far less elegant. When the Necron back to awaken millennia later, the False Necrons resumed their roles as advisors.[1a]
System	System is a catch-all term used by the Imperium to classify the various forms of star system that make up the galaxy. Each system is formed of at least one star and the stellar material that orbits it. Planetary systems are a minority of the systems that make up a sub-sector. Even within planetary systems with several planets, worlds inhabitable by humans are low in number. Of the ones that are inhabitable, or worth exploiting, the majority are mining, agri and civilised worlds. Relatively few systems possess Forge or Hive worlds, making those that do strategically important. Uninhabited systems can also have strategic importance, depending on their galactic location. Traveling between systems requires use of the Warp. Many systems are linked by Warpspace channels, which significantly speed up travel time.
Men of Gold	The Men of Gold are a mysterious subset of humanity. According to ancient sources, the Men of Gold appeared sometime during the Age of Terra, joining the Emperor as he watched and nurtured humanity. To watch and learn from mankind, the Golden Race spread across the face of Old Earth, multiplying and establishing order and civilization on the anarchy of nature. Though physically and emotionally superior, the Golden Race eventually created the Men of Stone for the purpose of colonizing the galaxy. In time, the Men of Stone supplanted the Men of Gold, and by M21 their influence had waned. It is ultimately unknown what happened to the Men of Gold.
Drugh	The Drugh are a large "larval" invertebrate or worm-like xenos-race, with advanced psionic ability, that lives on Pyrus I. As a subterranean species they infested Mundus Planus. It is believed that their original homeworld was destroyed by the Imperium towards the end of the Great Crusade. The examination of the Drugh Mouthparts, a preserved bony structure, by Magos Biologis Sharle Darvus, suggests it is a dual defecation/consumption organ.
Navigator	Navigators (Homo navigo) are a strain of abhumans[2e] responsible for guiding human ships through the Warp, via the use of their specialized third eye. Without the Navigators fast voyages beyond the closest systems would be impossible, thus being one of the most valuable assets.[3b] The majority of them comprise various Houses of Navis Nobilite, highly influential within the Imperium of Man.[2f] The status as mutants and members of the elite causes Navigators to rarely interact with other members of imperial society.[4b] The origins of the Navigator gene are shrouded in mystery and rumour,[2f] even among Navigators themselves, but firmly placed within the Dark Age of Technology;[2f] some sources state them to originate in M10, M15, M19,[8b] or M22, in any case predating the re-emergence of psykers in mankind. It is unknown whether they evolved on their own, or were manufactured by genetic engineering;[2f][10c] even if the consensus leads to the latter being the case, either would appear to be a response to mankind’s need to perfect Warp travel.[2f] Since their appearance they began to extend their influence due to their crucial service within human society, forming noble houses that with waxing and waning times ultimately grew in wealth, escaping the grasp of industrial and trading cartels,[10d] eventually establishing the Navis Nobilite well before the advent of the Imperium.[12a] It is of note that in M41 many held a belief that Navigator gene originated from the time just before the Great Crusade which took place between late M30 and early M31, manufactured by the Emperor himself.[2f] Some Ordos amongst the Holy Inquisition suspect that the ancient stasis vaults beneath the mansions of the Navigator's Quarter on Holy Terra contain records of the true origin of the Navigator gene.[3e] The aforementioned gene is easily lost through its recessive trait, and can only be saved for future generations through intermarriage, lost when bred with ordinary humans.[10c] The primary trait of a Navigator is their pineal eye, nested in a socket on their forehead.[3a] While it perfectly fills the sensory function as either of his normal eyes do, it is also extraordinarily able to open a miniscule Warp gate within it. From this stems all the Navigator’s powers. Although a state of the eye being open in a commonplace way of lifting its lid doesn’t cause the gate to open, confusingly the term “fully open” is applied when the latter happens. During the opening of said gate, Navigator is able to glimpse the Empyrean in its true state,[2f] although their mind converts this image to a more mundane approximation; only in age the allegory recedes to ring closer of the true horror of the Warp.[2b] Nonetheless the ability to observe the Warp is crucial in their function as navigational officers, allowing them uniquely to have some semblance of assurance of their position within it. While the eye always appears within a genetically pure newborn, in some cases it is located deep within the skull, requiring trepanning surgery and/or a cybernetic shutter for it to be brought to its proper spot. Those surgeries commonly occur during Navigator's adolescence.[2f] If, even with both of the parents being Navigators, a newborn has his Navigator gene dormant, and no Third Eye to speak of, they are called a Typhlotic. Even if the child is a barren fruit of the line, they aren't known to be harmed, and are kept around, although the specifics of their role in the house are unknown.[13b] Notwithstanding the Navigators' toleration of their unfortunate typhlotic kinfolk, the appearance of them within a lineage is considered a threat to the house's survival. Across the history there were few known houses who slowly but surely lost the ability to produce purestrain genestock, and at some point not even spending their whole fortune on bloodbrokers and unsound marriage arrangements is able to save the house from falling back into baseline humanity, without any such useful abilities their ancestors possessed.[3f]
Liber Xenologis	Liber Xenologis is a background book. It is written from an in-universe perspective by the Rogue Trader Janus Draik. "The Imperium is beset by horrors. Xenospecies too numerous to mention are bent on our destruction. Only by naming and studying these predators does humanity stand any chance of survival. And by circumstance, or perhaps by divine will, it has fallen to me, Captain Janus Draik, Rogue Trader and first son of House Draik, to codify the myriad threats aligned against us.
Xenos of Carmyn	The Xenos of Carmyn were an unnamed xenos race that inhabited the planet Carmyn, that xenobiologists estimated to be between sixty and six hundred million years old. They were a primitive autochthonous race with access to high technology trough traders. An eight-man Deathwatch Kill-Team was dispatched in 758.M41 to perform a cleansing operation on the planet, which was achieved in twelve Terran days. The Gladius Class Frigate Thunder's Word transported the force to Carmyn and carried out the opening bombardment phase. Within seventy-two hours no living xenos remained on the surface of Carmyn and the Kill-Team descended to locate and liquidate any survivors; extensive systems of underground nests were discovered and the Kill-Team methodically swept through them destroying all xenos. The xenos attempted to fight back against the Kill-Team with spears and slings, only revealing the aliens' hiding places the sooner.
Gretchin	Gretchin, Grots, or Runts are a lesser Orkoid slave race who do the menial tasks which Orks consider themselves above. Gretchin have a similar physical structure to orks but are much smaller and weaker. They have short, runty legs and grasping fingers to employ their greatest skill, low cunning. They are far more numerous than orks and have large, bulbous heads with tattered ears which flatten when they are scared. They have sharp-fanged jaws, which are their best physical weapon. They have excellent senses of smell, hearing, and low-light vision. These traits aid their self-preservation, allowing them to survive in dangerous ork society. Some gretchin have even developed a sixth sense of sorts, or a natural ability to be far more fortunate than they have a right to be. The Gretchin are happy enough in their role. They bear little resentment towards their superiors, for them Orks are just a fact of life. Individual Gretchin can enjoy a relatively comfortable existence by providing valuable services to their Ork masters. Most Grots are owned by Orks as personal servants, though some gather together into loose tribes that may even own functional weapons and equipment. The Gretchin have created an entire enterprise culture of their own within their Ork-dominated society. Many Gretchin operate their own black-market businesses on the side, such as selling fungus-beer, roasting squigs on sticks, coordinating the bets when a fight breaks out or looting corpses for fun and profit.
Hyperios missile launcher	The Hyperios Missile Launcher is a specialized, anti-aircraft missile launcher mounted on Space Marine Whirlwind Hyperios. It is capable of firing up to twenty Hyperios missiles at fast, low-flying targets, making it ideal for defense against ground-attack craft making strafing runs.[1a] Due to a lack of manpower for dedicated air defense units in Space Marine Chapters, It is common for Hyperios Missile Launchers equipped with automated remotely-activated defense systems to be utilized by Space Marine forces for local air defense. These automated platforms are dropped in by Thunderhawks, activated by the chapters Techmarines, and can be monitored via command vehicles. The Hyperios Anti-Aircraft Missile functions in a similar fashion to a Hunter-Killer Missile. Tracking equipment within the missile locks onto a target, which feeds information to a logis-engine. Once fired, the logis-engine manipulates the missile's fins in order match the target's movements, avoid obstacles, and destroy it. Most of the missile's mass is taken up by fuel needed to intercept fast-moving targets, allowing it to fly short distances at high velocity. The Hyperios missile does not contain enough fuel to reach high-altitude targets, which are better suited to Manticore AA missiles.[1b]
Nekulli	The Nekulli are a minor alien race about which little is known. A nekulli traveling in the entourage of a Rogue Trader in the Helican subsector was described as: "Slender and humanoid, but with long spine-scales flowing back from his scalp. The nekulli's eyes were white slits, his nose virtually absent, his lower jaw thrust forward. Two thin fangs hooked up from his underbite over his top lip. Like all nekulli, he walked with a hunch-shouldered waddle."[1a] Nekulli were mentioned as traders in the free trade station Bonner's Reach, and a nekulli was also encountered as a bodyguard.[1b]
Sirens	The Sirens are a psychic Xenos species, that can gain control of those who fall prey to their mesmeric abilities.[1b] They are small Xenos, that have numerous tentacles and cluster of orbs for eyes, which have a terrible intelligence within them. The Sirens attack with their psychic abilities and cast out their senses to find the minds of their prey. Once they sense one, the Xenos will use their mesmeric abilities, which strike directly at their victims' minds. This will feel like a hundred tiny worms are crawling through them, before this gives way to warmth and relaxation spreading through the victims' bodies. What comes next is the most dangers part of the Sirens' psychic attack, as their victims' brains are shown tempting visions. The parts of the brain that can analyse and know they are being shown false visions are then disabled, as the victims are completely overwhelmed by the Xenos' psychic might. These tempting visions vary depending on the victim and could for example transport them back to their childhood. Regardless of what is shown, however, the visions are used to convince the Sirens' prey to come to them, and could use the form of a family member to do so.[1b] If the victims are completely enraptured, they will do so and will attack anyone who tries to stop them. It is not known what the Sirens do to their victims when physical contact is made, but the usual result is their victims become zombie-like creatures known as the Mindless. These are psychically controlled by the Xenos, which causes the Mindless to mumble and drool, while having trembling and erratic motions, along with stumbling movements. It will also remove the Mindless' abilities to feel pain or fear and the Sirens will send them stumbling at their foes, heedless of the damage they take or losses they suffer. The Mindless will continue to advance regardless of the damage they take, unless their bodies are taken apart. Even the loss of legs will not prevent them from trying to come into physical range of the foes of their Xenos masters. Should they do so, the Mindless become extremely deadly, not only because they can not feel pain, but also because the Sirens have given them unnatural strength as well. This allows the Mindless to easily beat the Sirens' foes to death with their never tiring, flailing fists. A direct powerful blow can even kill on impact, while then sending their foe's body hurtling through the air.[1b]
Chuffian	The Chuffian are a race associated with the Chuffian Power Maul.
Dark Heresy Core Rulebook	The Dark Heresy Rulebook was published in 2008 and contains the core rules for the Dark Heresy Warhammer 40,000 Role-Playing Game system. It also contains new and expanded background material, particularly focusing on the Calixis Sector. During the production of this book, the following persons were involved considerably.
Thunder Warriors	The Thunder Warriors (also known as the Thunder Legion or Legiones Cataegis[10a]) were the genetically engineered warriors of Terra created by the Emperor of Mankind to unite the homeworld of humanity beneath His rule in the 30th Millennium. They were gene-enhanced warriors created by the Emperor and served as the precursors to the present-day Space Marines. Wrought to be living weapons, the Thunder Warriors were known to be physically stronger, more savage, and more potent in combat than the later Astartes, though they were not as long-lived. Thunder Warriors were the elite super-soldiers that marched with the Emperor to conquer Terra in the Wars of Unification. The engineering that the Emperor used to create the Thunder Warriors, whilst creating superior fighters, was not as efficient as what was used later to create the Space Marines, nor was the technology as advanced or the geneticists as entirely willing.[5a] These proto-Astartes were organised into twenty regiments of no more than a few hundred warriors, each named by the Emperor himself.[4b] The Thunder Warriors battled throughout the Unification Wars and united Terra for the first time in millennia under the rule of the Emperor. According to myth, they were all killed during the final battle of the Unification Wars, the Battle of Mount Ararat.
Helschen Empire	The Helschen Empire was a Xenos empire that were defeated by the Imperium. Ordo Xenos Inquisitor Parnival Gründvald was known as the Xenoscourge of Helschen. After the Badab War, Gründvald described that the Imperium had defeated the Helschen Empire, among many other Xenos and other threats.
Vorni	The Vorni are a sentient Xenos species, which are described as hulking bipedal crustaceans, that are nearly the height of a Space Marine. They are armed with powerful weapons called Thermic Accelerators and also have Warp capable void ships. The Vorni's leaders are known to be powerful Psykers, who have the ability to posses the minds of their enemies. It was this fact, that may have led the Blood Angels to attack the Vorni in the Plian System, which was held by the Xenos. What followed was a long and difficult campaign, that ended in the Vorni's defeat, but many of the Xenos were able to escape the System aboard their remaining void ships.
Chrobdyr Ferrophagites	The Chrobdyr Ferrophagites are a hostile sentient Xenos species. In M42, they are among those species that have been driven onto the warpath, after the Great Rift's creation consumed their home systems. This has led the Chrobdyr Ferrophagites to attack the territories of the Leagues of Votann.
Osirian Psybrid	The Osirian Psybrids were the term given by Imperial authorities to a race of highly psychic xenos. Clad in baroque armour containing ghastly barely-corporeal forms of mist, the Psybrids psychically traveled in hourglass-shaped vessels and mentally enslaved other species such as Humans and Orks. After inflicting severe losses on the early Ultramarines in the Osiris Rebellion during the Great Crusade, they were destroyed by Roboute Guilliman at the Battle of the Eurydice Terminal.
Species of Tyranid	A list of all known Tyranid species and sub-species. These are creatures that the Magos Biologis believe exist, but for which there is no physical evidence. These are species that the Magos Biologis believe may be species that evolved from Tyranid that were left behind from failed Tyranid invasions.
Kharateg	The Kharateg are a Xenos species. Some members of the species, joined the Warband of the Dragon Warriors Sorcerer Lord Nihilan and took part in his invasion of the Salamanders' Homeworld Nocturne.
Egarian	The Egarian (or Egerian) are an extinct race that lived deep within the Winterscale Realm, in a cluster of four systems known as the Egarian Dominion. Their planets suffered a cataclysm of stellar proportions and the only traces of the species' existence are the cyclopean Maze Cities in these planets. They are the subject of various dark legends. It is said that they were corrupted by the Yu'vath of the Calyx Expanse, granting the Egarians powers that doomed them to total extinction, and traces of this terrible fate are found throughout the Koronus Expanse, the Rifts of Hecaton being a prominent example.
Ff'eng	The Ff'eng, are mysterious xenos race that the Imperium knows little about.
Threadlairs of the Riftborn	The Threadlairs of the Riftborn are a Xenos species.
Medusae	Medusae are strange creatures of the Webway that often find themselves as servants within an Archon's court and are quite sought after by the denizens of the Dark City of Commorragh. Medusae are known to be highly empathic parasites that appear as a collection of brains and spinal cords that are stacked on top of one another. These creatures seemingly float across the ether like jellyfish where they feed on the dreams, as well as nightmares, of sentient beings. They can also latch upon a living host, allowing them to feed upon the emotions of their host directly and through this process, provide the power they require to manifest in realspace, thus becoming hybrid creatures of both the material world and the Immaterium. In combat, their empathic abilities are weaponised: a simple gaze from a Medusae can lead to instant emotional hemorrhaging by exposing their victims to raw anguish, potentially putting them into a coma from which there is no recovery. In addition, they are also able to absorb extreme sensations, which are highly prized in Dark Eldar society. The brain fruit of the Medusae are capable of being consumed and allow an individual to re-experience the vivid and anarchic emotions of a raid all over again.
Thazeme	The Thazeme were a race of horrific xenos destroyed in the Purging of Castillium in M41 by an Imperial biological weapon.
Xenarch	The Xenarch are an isolationist warp-worshiping xenos species whose empire is believed to reside in the Galactic north. It is rumoured that they are able to generate biological electro-plasma and are known to have created devices of an unknown alloy known as Xenarch Conduction Spines designed to focus as well as generate energy directly from Xenarch biology. Their electrical weapons became highly prized as they utilized charge cells and capacitators that were beyond the capabilities of the Adeptus Mechanicus to manufacture. One of their most notable weapons is the Xenarch death-arc, a rifle-sized weapon that unleashes a series of arcing bolts of lightning. Little contact had been made between the Imperium and the shadowy Xenarch empire that is located in the Northern Rim. In 989.M41, Helbrecht of the Black Templars Chapter was responsible for the final subjugation of the Xenarch in the Sigilare Nebula.
Kethid	The Kethid were a Xenos species that lived on the planet Golthya. The Human population of the planet had been subjugated by the Kethid and Golthya was therefore the site of a Compliance action by the Iron Hands and World Eaters Legions, during the Great Crusade. The Kethid were described as grey skinned and hairless humanoids who could control the winds.
Unfleshed	The Unfleshed were a group of mutant-like creatures that existed on Medrengard, the current homeworld of the Iron Warriors. Inside the fortress of Khalan-Ghol, the Iron Warriors created the Daemonculaba, a system designed to manufacture vast numbers of Chaos Space Marines, by combining human slaves with the captured geneseed of Imperial Space Marines. The Unfleshed were the failed "offspring" of the Daemonculaba, born disfigured and without skin.[1x] After failing inspection by their creators, they were flushed out through the fortress's sewer systems of a fortress upon Medrengard. However, these creatures did not always die, but sometimes survived and even thrived. Although each was unique in shape and size, the scent they carried from the Daemonculuba made them kin, and together they hunted for meat wherever it could be found on the Daemon World.[1x]
Perpetual	A Perpetual is an immortal and nigh-indestructible human. Some Perpetuals are part of a sect that wished to guide human evolution. Some Perpetuals can regenerate from almost any injury however grievous, including decapitation, dismemberment, and disintegration.[1a] There are few ways of actually killing such Perpetuals. One method is by the Fulgurite.[1b] Perpetuals may be natural-born or created. The Emperor transformed Dalia Cythera into a Perpetual so that she could watch over the Void Dragon indefinitely. The Cabal is capable of turning humans into Perpetuals John Grammaticus is one such example. Ollanius Persson, by contrast, is a natural-born Perpetual. In addition to the abilities, many Perpetuals consider it their mission and indeed, their moral responsibility to guide humanity. Having withdrawn from this imperative, at the beginning of the Horus Heresy, a retired Oll Persson was living in exile, and refused to be called a Perpetual.
Kral'ac Star Empire	The Kral'ac Star Empire was a xenos empire that came into contact with the fleet of the Rogue Trader Nestor Marchandrei during the Great Crusade. Conflict would break out between them and though the Rogue Trader's fleet was destroyed, Marchandrei had contacted the Imperium for aid before he died. This aid came in the form of the Space Wolves Legion, which completely destroyed the Kral'ac Star Empire.
Saruthi	The Saruthi are a minor alien race encountered by the Imperium over the course of events of a young Inquisitor Gregor Eisenhorn during his prosecution of House Glaw. Until the forging of the Imperium, the Saruthi had an ancient and small empire of about forty worlds, though this would change upon their first contact with humanity. Fleeing from the Imperium at an unknown point in history, a heretical group of human refugees bartered with the Saruthi for asylum in exchange for the Necroteuch, a Chaotic tome of considerable power. The knowledge contained within corrupted the Saruthi utterly, and the power of Chaos entered into their souls and minds, even their genetic code. A civil war engulfed their empire, leading to abandonment of many outposts and colonies. Their empire shrank immensely.[1b] One old world of theirs that had been abandoned as a result of their civil war was designated in imperial records as KCX-1288, to which they would briefly return to complete their compact with House Glaw. Another world, which held a surviving population of Saruthi, was the world known as 56-Izar,[1c] which had been invaded by an Inquisitorial task force searching for the Saruthi version of the Necroteuch. 56-Izar was subjected to Exterminatus after the Saruthi Necroteuch was destroyed, and no contact was made with the Saruthi again.[1d]
Cratchets	The Cratchets are a leather-skinned Xeno species that has come into conflict with the Imperium.
Lacrymole	The Lacrymole are a lesser known race of aliens which have the ability to shapeshift and change their appearance at will. They stow aboard Imperial craft to travel the galaxy where they feed upon the blood of their victims. They were first discovered by Inquisitor Parnival Gründvald on Betacairn. Gründvald held an assembly with many other members of the Ordo Xenos to declare the race Xenos Horrificus. It was believed that Lacrymole were purged and cleansed, though later Inquisitor Malas Dyce encountered them on the Space Hulk Charnel Spectre.
Ubergast	The Ubergast are a horrific breed of Xenos. Feared by the Imperium, the Ubergast had a major resurgence in mid-M32 during the War of the Beast.
Vektates	The Vektates were a deviant Xenos species that resided on the world Arkenath. They had the ability to form an overmind, which they used to enslave the Human population that also resided on their Homeworld. However during the Great Crusade, the Ultramarines Captain Hektor discovered Arkenath and launched a three year war to free the enslaved Humans. When the last of the Vektates were killed, the Humans of Arkenath were finally freed of their mind control and they eagerly joined the Imperium.
Tygrrish	The Tygrrish were a Xenos species, that were wiped out by Tyranids led by the Swarmlord.
Saharduin	The Saharduin, also known as Pisceans, are a Xenos species that were attacked by the Space Wolves Legion during the Great Crusade, losing at least some domains due to this attack. Despite these losses, the Saharduins were still active in late M41, and many of their planets remain unexplored by the Imperium.[Note 1] The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Snotling	The Snotlings (sometimes called Snots) are an Orkoid species. The exact nature of the Snotlings is the subject of some controversy. Ork legend tells of a lost race of Orkoids that were highly intelligent, called the "Brainboyz" by the Orks. The Brainboyz created the other Orkoid species as a means of protection, while at the same time directing Greenskin society. What happened next is unknown. Some legends indicate the Brainboyz died out during a great plague (giving the implication that the Brainboyz were really the Old Ones). Other legends indicate that the Brainboyz reverted into the Snotlings.[1a] They are tiny beings that appear as small Gretchin, and being so, occupy what is perhaps the lowest rung of Ork society. While the Gretchin serve as servants and other secondary positions in Ork society, Snotlings will serve sometimes as "pets," but more often they serve in Orkish agricultural and animal husbandry roles due to their affinity with the fungus and squigs that appear in Ork settlements. Supervised and trained by Runtherds, Snotlings will cultivate the fungus to provide Orks with food, drink, and medicine. Snotlings' affinity with squigs usually ensures that only a few dozen Snotlings are eaten by their "livestock" on any given day.[1a]
Immortal Duty (Short Story)	"Immortal Duty" is a short story by Nick Kyme in the Horus Heresy series. Ahrem Gallikus, Medusan Immortal and disgraced warrior of the Iron Hands, faces death – at the hands of his own brothers. But first they would know his story – the story of his greatest battle, against his erstwhile allies on board the warship Retiarius in orbit of the world where their Legion was shattered – Isstvan V. Forming part of a boarding action, Gallikus took the battle to the traitors – but what happened, and why has it led him to where he is now?
Vassalian	The Vassalian were a race that fought Hive Fleet Jormungandr at the side of High Admiral Vortigern Hanroth, with their ships in Vassalian Slavebirds. They were at war with the Donarathi before the attack of the hive fleet.
Reptos	The Reptos are an alien species native to the Jungle World of Hyades.[1a] Reptos are described as being both simian and reptilian. They were fairly quick but on the small side, and easily killed by Space Marines and the Hyades PDF. They are sentient and intelligent enough to form plans and set traps. They have their own language.[1c] The Reptos are quite primitive and have no higher levels of technology. They may have built certain temples on Hyades. Once the Imperium arrived on Hyades they were deemed little more than a nuisance and little effort was made to exterminate them.[1b]
Kalavassi	The Kalavassi are a territorial Xenos species that launched a war against one of the Black Legion's Balefleets after it entered their territory.
Gnostari	The Gnostari are a sentient xenos species. During the Nachmund Rift War, they used the opportunity to raid Imperial mining asteroids at Giara's Necklace. According to the 9th edition Votann codex, the Gnostari are a misidentified fleet of the Leagues of Votann.
Ghluthykk	The Ghluthykk are a Sentient Xenos species. Several of their viro-combines were active in Segmentum Pacificus' Bastior Sub-sector, when Hive Fleet Grendyllus invaded it during the Fourth Tyrannic War. This led the Ghluthykk to be among the many Xenos species that either fought against or fled from the Hive Fleet, as it swarmed the Sub-sector.
Ghassulian	The Ghassulians were a Xenos species that ruled a small empire during the Great Crusade known as the Ghassulian Sub-Realms. The aliens lived in fortified bastion-cities which proved difficult to capture, resulting in the Space Wolves requesting the development of the Whirlwind Scorpius to try and counter them.
Piscean	Pisceans are a mythical Xenos species heavily associated with the history of Necromunda. It is rumored that long ago this aquatic xenos race arrived on Necromunda, which at the time still had large oceans. It is said they were both cunning and violent and viciously resisted humanity's conquest of Necromunda years later. According to the legends of House Delaque, the Pisceans vanished shortly before Necromunda became consumed by industry and war. The Delaque believe the Pisceans did not leave Necromunda, but instead took refuge in the subterranean oceans near the planet's core. It is thought that Delaque first encountered them thereafter and discovered they had a similar psychic gestalt mind as members of the House. A silent partnership has grown over the centuries between the two; though the Delaque have never visited the cities of the Pisceans, it is believed the fish-aliens have ventured to the surface and offered themselves to the House of Shadow. These are ancient Piscean warriors who come to the depths of the Hives to die in the enclaves of Delaque and have their brains placed in mechanical caskets. These are eventually fashioned into cybernetic hunters known as Piscean Spektors. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Asuryani	The Asuryani,[1a] also known as Craftworld Eldar or Eldar of the Stars, are kindred of the Drukhari and other Aeldari, an ancient race of elf-like humanoids. Their armies make use of specialist warriors, known as Aspect Warriors and a wide range of specialised vehicles.[1b] The Asuryani reside aboard vast ships known as Craftworlds and transverse the galaxy use a network of extra-dimensional tunnels known as the Webway. Each Craftworld possesses its own heritage, history, and even goals. While some Craftworlds may be reclusive in nature, others are known to have gained notoriety.[3a] Amongst the more well-known races and factions in the galaxy, the Asuryani are unique in that they are entirely void-faring. However, a Craftworlder may leave the Asuryani path to potentially become an Outcast, Corsair, or any number of paths beyond life in the Craftworld.[1d] While Craftworlds may be allied, there is no singular leader amongst the Asuryani. Each Craftworld may possess different forms of leadership, be they Seer Councils[1e] or a system of clan alliances.[1f]
Zutan Scribes	The Zutan Scribes are said to be a sentient Xenos species, which sketches depict as kraken-like leviathans with lots of tentacles. However there is some doubt, as to whether the species truly exists. All the myths regarding the Zutan refer to them as a race of scholars and archivists, who seek and hoard information for a purpose known known only to them. Several reputable Xenologists have refuted claims that the Zutan are a genuine Xenos species and suggest the tales originated in sightings of oversized octopodiformes.
Indaar	The Indaar are a highly advanced sentient arthropod Xenos species, whose warriors are larger than a full-grown Grox. The Imperium's first encounter with the Indaar occurred in Ultima Segmentum, when the Xenos attacked and defeated a large Explorator Fleet. The level of firepower displayed by the Indaar's warships was beyond anything in the Imperial Navy's arsenal and few of the Explorator Fleet's warships managed to escape. One warship that did, however, brought back the corpse of an Indaaran warrior, which resembled the trilobite fossils once found on ancient Terra. The Imperium still knows little about the Indaar, though it has discovered the Xenos build a type of warship called the Cenadensis.
Slann	The Slanni, also known as the Slann,[1b] are a sentient reptilian or amphibian alien species who are or were or have inherited the legacy of the Old Slann.[1b] Before the Imperium of Man, and even before the Yldari, the Slanni ruled a mighty galactic domain. The Slann claim to be, and may actually be, the oldest of all the races in the galaxy. During the heyday of their old empire, they discovered and nurtured many primitive species, encouraging their evolutionary process while eradicating or moving more dangerous species, and seeding many worlds with livestock.[1b]. When the Eldar first encountered the Old Slann, who were the greatest of all spacefaring peoples, they learned many secrets of the universe from them, including the principles of warp-tunnel engineering, the nature of the warp, and referring to the sentient creatures of the warp as the Powers of Chaos.[3a] While the Old Slann taught the Eldar about the dangers of the warp, they also taught them about its many positive aspects. They taught how the mind of a living creature passes upon death into the warp, where it may, if the individual mind has achieved power, remain whole and immortal as a spirit in the warp. It was the Slann belief that the object of life was to perfect the mind, and thereby achieve conscious immortality as a spirit of in the warp, where it could then reincarnate. However, the Old Slann warned that such an existence was impossible if one's own thoughts were too close to the Powers of Chaos, for one's consciousness would be devoured by a greater power upon death, with one losing their identity and melting into the greater power.[3b]
Avenians	The Avenians were humans who resided on Ark Reach Secundus during the Great Crusade. Mechanicum geneticists recorded that the Avenians possessed an incredibly diverse genetic baseline noted to be far removed from the archetypal human genome. It was speculated this was due to the millennia of separation from the rest of humanity during Old Night. The Avenians were described as being graceful and fine-boned with facial features sharp and angular. Although they appeared to be weak and fragile; later research proved their bodies to actually be flexible and strong. They lived in silver towers on top of the tallest mountain peaks of Heliosa. These towers were interconnected by feather-light bridges.The Avenians were also noted to have a close relationship with a wide variety of aerial beasts.
Vygore	The Vygore are a thermoparasitic Xenos species.
Vurls	The Vurls are a Xenos species.
L'Huraxi	The L'Huraxi are a race of purple-skinned giants, equipped armoured vehicles, that fought against the Catachan Jungle Fighters at the Battle of Moden's Ridge.
Kehletai	The Kehletai were a minor Xenos race encountered by the Imperium during the Great Crusade. They were eventually wiped out in a campaign known as the Kraal Compliance. The Kehletai made monomolecular-edged close-combat weapons that were some of the keenest blades ever encountered in the galaxy. One example of these, known as a "Friction Axe", was broader than a Fenrisian battle axe, and joined the private armoury collection of the Ultramarines Primarch, Roboute Guilliman. During the Battle of Calth, this axe was used to great effect by Sergeant Aeonid Thiel, and by Chapter Master Marius Gage, against the daemons overrunning the flagship Macragge's Honour. Gage, who had lost an arm to the daemons before being rescued by Thiel, noted that the axe, despite its massive size, was light enough to be wielded one-handed.
Knydd	The Knydd are a Xenos species whose migrations have been interrupting Imperial shipping in the Asmodiox and Morpheum sectors of Segmentum Pacificus in M42 just before the start of the Fourth Tyrannic War.
Gudoryx	The Gudoryx are a sentient Xenos species, that was nearly destroyed by the Black Templars Ledovar Crusade. They once had a rich religious heritage, that contained life-shrines, crystal statues and sacred myceleine codices. All of which were protected by the Gudoryx's War-broods. However during their conflict with the Ledovar Crusade, 23 of the Crusade's Sword Brethren appointed themselves the holy task of eradicating all trace of the Xenos' fervent faith. By the time the Crusade was done, the Sword Brethren had erased from the galactic record, every trace of the Gudoryx's fervent faith. The last dregs of the Xenos species that still live, are now left to squirm in the mud, in barbarous ignorance.
Haruspex (Xenos)	The Haruspex are xenos marauders believed to originate from the Slinnar Drift, in the Jericho Reach. They travel in packs and are led by Haruspex Lifeseekers.
Grell (Xenos Species)	The Grell are a small Chaos worshiping Xenos species, that sells arcane psychotraumic instruments. They were once greater in numbers, but the Grell were nearly destroyed by the Corvas Vault's Deathwatch forces. When the Night Lords Chaos Lord Veska'gar learned of this, he attacked the Watch Fortress in a rage with his Warband. By the battle's end, the Corvas Vault's Deathwatch forces were dead and Veska'gar had all of their eyes taken out. He would deliver these to the surviving Grell, who accepted the gelatinous prizes with relish. The Xenos then tell the Chaos Lord, that his actions earned him great favor with the Masters Beyond.
Greyva	The Greyva are a xenos species, that are currently fighting the Imperium across multiple war zones. Due to the Indigan Praefects' reputation for being experts in fighting giant creatures, such as the Tyranids, they are requested as reinforcements whenever the Imperium encounters the Greyva.
Oretti	The Oretti are a sentient Xenos species of insecto-hominids. They have elongated, multi-jointed limbs which end in hooves and a thick, leathery carapace. The Oretti also have numerous tentacles where their mouth is located and a cluster of spider-like eyes. Their males resemble small sneaky creatures with long forelimbs and a single back limb resembling a tail, which helps them to make powerful jumps. These Xenos make some sort of energy weapon which they can hold with their belly appendages. The weapon are too weak to penetrate a Space Marine's Power Armour but can easily hollow out the bare flesh of humans. Female Orreti are much larger – twice the height of Space Marine - and besides energy weapon they are also armed with gleaming blades and wear plates of iridescent armour. The legs of an Orreti end in hooves. Some Orreti can speak in Gothic, although with their own musical accent.
Thengl	The Thengl were an ancient xenos species, whose history and deeds have been lost to myth. They were one of the many species to have encountered the moon-sized Space Hulk known in the 42nd Millennium as the Gallowdark, which they named the Thousand Maws.
Londaxi	The Londaxi are a sentient and technologically gifted[1a] Xenos species, that has clashed with the Imperium. Among the weapons they have created are the Londaxii Tribalests, which are sometimes wielded by Kroot Heavy Gunners.[1b]
Wolfen	The Wolfen are a Xenos species.
Killip'rene	The Killip'rene are a Xeno species that has come into conflict with the Imperium.
Gransha	The Gransha are a Xenos civilization. They have suffered several harvesting raids by the Necron Enat'hef Dynasty.
Septeryx	The Septeryx are a hostile and insidious sentient Xenos species. In M42, they are among those species that have driven onto the warpath, after the Great Rift's creation consumed their home systems. This has led the Septeryx to attack the territories of the Leagues of Votann.
Gykon	The Gykon are a Xenos race that opposed the Imperium at the time of the Great Crusade.
Eldar Gods	Eldar Mythology, told through the Eldar Mythic Cycles, is an ancient story that binds the Eldar race together and forms a basis for much of their thinking on their ancient past. It told of their pantheon of gods and heroes, all of whom would perish in the Fall of the Eldar – save three, Cegorach in the Black Library, Khaine shattered among the warhosts of the Asuryani, and Isha held captive in the Garden of Nurgle.[1a] It tells of their new heroes, the Phoenix Lords, of the awakening god Ynnead, and into the fated future and end of all Eldar, the Rhana Dandra. The Eldar Mythic Cycles are recorded in verse, remembered in the metaphors of the Eldar Language, and told throughout the Aeldari diaspora by the dances of the Harlequins. The Eldar race are descended from Isha, the goddess of the harvest, and Kurnous, the god of the hunt, through the two brothers Eldanesh and Ulthanesh.[5a] Their first leader was Eldanesh, who, with the support of his brother Ulthanesh, led the Eldar to many victories over nightmarish foes such as the Hresh-selain.[4a] In their moment of creation, the Eldar were given one gift by each god: Asuryan gave the Eldar wisdom, so that they may know themselves; Isha gave the Eldar love, so that they may know one another; Vaul gave the Eldar the Artifice, as a means to make their dreams realities; Lileath gave the Eldar joy, so that they would be happy; Kurnous gave the Eldar desire, so they that would prosper; Morai-Heg gave the Eldar foresight, so that they would know their place in the world; Khaine gave the Eldar anger, so that they may have a means to defend their gifts.[4b]
Laer	The Laer were non-humanoid aliens.[1c] They, along with their planet Laeran, were exterminated by the Emperor's Children (Pre-Heresy) during the 28th Expedition in a campaign that came to be called the Cleansing of Laeran.[Needs Citation] All Laer maintain a snake-like lower body, with insectoid heads and mandibular features. But the Laer society genetically and chemically modified their bodies to better suit the task individuals were given, something that came to be a fascination with Apothecary Fabius Bile. Noted are aerial, land-based and aquatic warrior forms.[1a] They wielded gauntlets capable of firing green-hued energy beams, able to pierce Space Marine battle armour with ease, and also sported energized blades from which not even Terminator armour found refuge.[Needs Citation] The Laer were passionate worshippers of Slaanesh, and the cleansing of their planet would be the ultimate underlying cause of Fulgrim's turn to Chaos, and with it his Legion.[Needs Citation]
Guldaniri	The Guldaniri are one of the many Xenos species that became extinct, after the Imperium brought the Askellon Sector into Compliance. While little of their civilization remains, the Guldaniri's weapons are still easily found and terrorize the Sector's Low Worlds to Rubicon.
Hopeweavers	The Hopeweavers are a Xenos species.
Warriors of Tohruk	Warriors of Tohruk are the debased and brutal cousins of the Ogryns. Dwelling in the Eastern Fringe, they struck a secret agreement with Night Lords Primarch Konrad Curze sometime before the Horus Heresy. During the Thramas Crusade their agreement was enacted, and they were used as shock troops by the Night Lords against the Dark Angels.
Kond Hounds	The Kond Hounds are said to be a sentient Xenos species of winged semi-canid humanoids. However, there is some doubt as to whether the species truly exists. They are a staple in myths across the worlds of the Neldus Sector in Segmentum Obscuras. The most outlandish stories claim the Kond are wise humanoids, who can produce void-faring ships and plasma weapons. However these stories originated in the now discredited Bibliotheque Xenologis text.
Jorgall	The Jorgall were a race of aliens that occupied Imperial space in the Tasak Beta and Fallon systems at the time of the Great Crusade. They traveled between planets in enormous cylindrical spacecraft with chlorinated atmospheres. During the Battle of Iota Horologi Battle-Captain Nathaniel Garro's company of the Death Guard fought aboard one of their cylinder ships, aided by a cadre of the Sisters of Silence. The Jorgall were radially symmetrical with three arms and legs, scaly and horned skin, and an egg-shaped head with fleshy notches for mouths and noses atop an extensible neck. The nervous system was centralized in the torso and their circulatory systems pumped foul-smelling crimson blood. A mature adult stood 4.5 metres tall. All Jorgalli encountered had extensive cybernetic augmentation including wheels for feet, claws for hands, teleoptic cameras in place of eyes, subdermal armour, or implanted needler weapons. A group encountered by the Death Guard had two legs replaced with wings. The children of the race possess psychic abilities, which may be lost once they reach adulthood.
Khrave	The Khrave, also known as Khrave Marauders are a xenos-race of mind-eaters. The Khrave have been described as larger than humans, with faces like huge, carnivorous bats. Some have been described as possessing wings. It is said they exist in both the Materium and Immaterium simultaneously. Khrave are divided into "root minds", which are the actual organisms, and those slave organisms that serve their will. Root-Minds are over three meters tall and capable of great psychic feats which can enslave an entire world on their own. However even Khrave root minds require an initial biological host to fully manifest.
Donarathi	The Donarathi were a race that fought Hive Fleet Jormungandr at the side of High Admiral Vortigern Hanroth, with their ships in Donarathi Thunderprows. They were at war with the Vassalian before the attack of the hive fleet.
Thyrrus	The Thyrrus are a squid-like alien species who see war as a performance, thus making tactical decisions based on spectacle, flash and aiming to inflict the heaviest casualties on both sides - rather than what is tactically sensible to non-Thyrrus. They made unprovoked assaults in the Segmentum Pacificus around 2.306.784.M41 against regiments of the Stemivari Imperial Guard, who referred to them by the nickname of "squiddies." Sighted possible classes/unit types are Thyrrus warriors, soliloquns, propmasters, and luminous war-machines.
Nostrafex	The Nostrafex are an abhorred Sentient Xenos species which, like the Simulacra and the Cryptos, pose an insidious and subtle danger to the Imperium. The species have the ability to turn Humans against each other and treats Mankind as little more than their cattle or playthings.
Mebrii	The Mebrii are a Sentient Xenos species. They were active in Segmentum Pacificus' Bastior Sub-sector, when Hive Fleet Grendyllus invaded it during the Fourth Tyrannic War. This led the Mebrii to be among the many Xenos species that either fought against or fled from the Hive Fleet, as it swarmed the Sub-sector.
Skorl	The Skorl are a Xenos species that resemble invertebrates and they first came to the Imperium's attention when they attacked G-X-17. The Xenos then began feasting upon the Agri World's farmers and their Priest sent out a plea for aid. Unfortunately for the farmers, the message was received by the Radical Inquisitor Bors Callimue, who began studying the Skorl, instead of sending help. The Inquisitor soon found them to be a remarkable species, which did not merit being destroyed by the Imperium over the loss of a few hundred fungus farmers. Bors determined that the Skorl's weapon technology alone, such as the phase-inverter cannon, demanded that the Imperium make peaceful contact with the Skorl in order to initiate trade between them. In order for that to happen, Bors decided to offer the Skorl the right to prey upon G-X-17's population without worry of Imperial retribution, at least until the Imperium could reverse-engineer the Xenos' technology. Once that happened, Bors would make sure the Skorl were destroyed.
Scythian	The Scythians are a xenos species in the galaxy of which little was known except that they came from a region of space designated HR8518. They are noted as being a race of warrior-monks, dedicated to a peculiar form of armed martial arts. The species is known to be the creators of both the Scythian Venom Talon and the Scythian Fury Talons that are ritualistic weapons capable of delivering multiple doses of poisons or drugs. This race was first encountered shortly after the Horus Heresy and was previously unknown to the Imperium. At this time, the Crimson Fists Chapter engaged the xenos and cleansed their home system. During the Crusade, they specialised in underhanded surprise tactics and preferred the use of much-feared venom-based weaponry. During the war they met with only limited success but were able to strike down Alexis Polux, the first Chapter Master of the Crimson Fists. Some were able to survive the xenocide, and the race lives on as mercenaries, often offering services as assassins. Like the Tarellians, they are always keen to exact revenge against the hated Imperium.
Taralais	The Taralais are a Xenos species whose domains were lost in an invasion by the Space Wolves Legion during the Great Crusade.
Kreg	The Kreg are a powerful sentient xenos species. According to the 9th edition Votann codex, the Kreg are a misidentified fleet of the Leagues of Votann.
Ghanathaar	The Ghanathaar are described in several Imperial records as an ancient non-humanoid Xenos species, that once resided in the Jericho Reach. This ended during the Great Crusade, when the Imperium attacked the Ghanathaar's domain at the Reach's border with the Eastern Fringe. The war against the Ghanathaar was considered to be amongst the most serious opposition to the Crusade's efforts to bring the Jericho Reach into Compliance. While the Imperium was ultimately victorious, the war with the Xenos destroyed the capacity of numerous worlds in that portion of the Reach to sustain life. This is a factor that has come to shape the future the Jericho Reach. The Ultramarines Legion are believed to be among the Imperial forces that took part in the war against the Ghanathaar. 2033 members of the Legion perished, in what the Ultramarines called the War against the Ghan'at Hark. The fallen were honoured by having their names engraved upon a Charantracite relief panel in Macragge's Chapel of Ages.
Kolobite Empire	The Kolobite Empire was a Xenos Empire that clashed with the Imperium during the early years of the Great Crusade. They suffered a massive defeat on the world Carthis when the Kolobite's drone-king was killed in single combat with the Space Wolves Wolf Guard Brynngar.
Phor'pex	The Phor'pex are a parasitic race that is a new threat to the Imperium.
Talopus Slavers	The Talopus Slavers are said to be a sentient Xenos species of humanoid giants. Their fearsome appearance causes their enemies to rarely face them in battle without fleeing. However there is some doubt, as to whether the species truly exists. The Imperium has developed a hysteria with the Talopus, which can be traced to the Rogue Trader Polignan Syrt. Syrt claimed to have slain one of the giants in a void battle near Messen IV, which the Talopus' remains landed upon. The Rogue Trader subsequently retrieved the giant's charred remains and took picts of it, before going on to boast about the battle. This caused a great hysteria within the Imperium and resulted in the Imperial Navy sending several Frigates to Messen IV. However the Frigate's were never heard from again and Syrt later vanished as well. The Xenologist Janus Draik claims that the Talopus do not exist, though, and blames Syrt for the Imperium's hysteria with the giants. Draik truly believes that Syrt simply concocted an elaborate tale, in an attempt to garner glory for himself. The Xenologist has also viewed the picts of the Talopus' remains and theorized that Syrt simply grafted various body parts together and then burned them to disguise his handiwork.
K'nib	The K'Nib are an alien species nurtured by the Old Ones about which little is known. What is known is that they are described as "festering" and are known to have ten limbs.
Sensei	The Sensei are the natural descendants of the Emperor who wander the galaxy as heroes and champions. Springing out of the Emperor's union with various mortal women throughout history, they are bestowed with the gift of immortality and various powers, both commonplace and unique.[1a] Inherently resistant to Chaos, they often fill the role of the Star Child's champions, analogous to the champions of the Chaos Gods. However, the Inquisition, for the same reason, declares them all heretics, as their unique psychic powers and inherent rebellious drive to serve order and good often cause them to oppose Imperial repression. Long before the birth of the Imperium, the Emperor lived in hiding amongst ordinary men, and during this time he fathered many families. Not all members of the lineages fathered by the Emperor produce an individual known as Sensei, but the offspring of one or any of his kin, have this potential hidden in their genes.
Gransathian Dominion	The Gransathian Dominion was a xenos empire that clashed with the Imperium during the Great Crusade. Though it employed bio-colossi against the Imperium's forces, the Dominion was finally destroyed after a 7 year war. Among the forces the Imperium committed during the extermination campaign were the Knights of House Zavora.
The Horus Heresy Book Seven	The Horus Heresy Book Seven - Inferno is the seventh book in the Horus Heresy series by Forge World. It covers the Burning of Prospero. The Horus Heresy Book Seven – Inferno is a supplement for Warhammer 40,000 which depicts the cataclysmic battle of the Burning of Prospero, home planet of the Thousand Sons Legion, the near-destruction of that Legion, the fall of its Primarch, Magnus, and the tangled web of fate and treachery which led up to it. Within the leather-bound, 312-page book, you’ll find detailed background information on the Fall of Prospero, told across six chapters from The Trial of The Sorcerer to The Seeds of Heresy, exploring the bitter struggle to defend Prospero from the merciless punishment meted out by the Imperium’s forces. Included are full army lists for Space Wolves, Thousand Sons and Talons of the Emperor, allowing you to play the full Prospero campaign – 4 Missions, 3 Conclusion Missions and 3 Legendary Missions are included, alongside a host of special and optional rules.
Sza	The Sza were a Xeno species that were part of the Autocracy of Szaeyr - an alien/human coalition of worlds in the trailing reaches of Segmentum Tempestus. When Deathwatch Watch Commander Balhus learned of the Autocracy, he grew so incensed at the heretical integration between the Sza and their Human allies, that he called for a Deathwatch Crusade to destroy them. Though there are no records as to the conclusion of the battle, the amount of firepower that the Deathwatch brought against the Autocracy leave little doubt that it was destroyed and the Sza were hunted to extinction.
Laraviria	The Laraviria are a now-extinct aquatic Xenos species that once dwelled within the system of Orcana. They are known to have terraformed multiple planets of the system to suit their aquatic nature.
Kyaire	The Kyaire are a Xenos species, that once dwelled in the Askellon Sector. A few hundred years after the Imperium brought the Sector in Compliance, however, the Kyaire were driven out during one of Askellon's Imperial Purgation Wars against Xenos. In battle, the species reportedly relied on launcher-style weaponry, that used a variety of highly potent rounds. Some of these rounds, such as the Kyaire Riveblade Grenade, still survive to this day in concealed vaults along the Cyclopia Sub-Sector.
Scyan Nomads	The Scyan Nomads are a sentient Xenos species of winged, cyclopean giants who are found across the Lorix Sector. They have a peculiar belief that this plane of existence is the afterlife and the Scyan will only truly begin living once they die. They also write sagas concerning a beast called the Duchau, that can ignite the Scyan simply by fixing its livid gaze upon them.
Precipice	Precipice is a Space station in Segmentum Pacificus[2a] that has been cobbled together from the wreckage of numerous ships that have tried to forcibly claim a nearby Blackstone Fortress.[2b] It is home to various Human, Abhuman and Xenos scavengers and serves as a waypoint for those looking to venture into the Blackstone Fortress.
	The Sylvae were a Xenos race that was manipulated by the Deceiver to reach low technology levels but who were highly spiritual and philosophical. Imperial Explorators bombed the race's centres of worship and killed their senior religious leaders, causing the race to fall into disarray. After this the Deceiver considered the race unworthy of his patronage as it slid back into barbarism and exterminated them with his Necron armies.
Noctal	The Noctal are a spindly insectoid species, that conquered the Imperium world Mearopyis and enslaved its population. The Noctal had controlled the world for several thousand years, until the Imperium returned in late M41. A large Imperial Navy fleet and three-quarters of a million Astra Militarum Guardsmen are now attempting to reclaim Mearopyis from their dominance. The species was caught off guard by the invasion, and while they have superior numbers, no unified resistance has been brought to bear against the Imperium. However, the Noctal are fighting back with their Superdestroyer warships and their dart-shaped fighters. While the Noctal's fighters are swift and agile, able to outmaneuver their Imperial counterparts, they are outnumbered and incapable of orbital flight. This has allowed the Imperial Navy's Thunderbolts and their compliment of the Marauder Bomber to safely bomb and fire upon the Noctal's forces on Mearopyis. The Navy’s assets are focused on taking out targets that block the path of the Astra Militarium, who are charged with seizing the Noctal's capital on the planet. When the capital falls, the Imperials believe the world will be theirs once again.
Nepenthis	Nepenthis was a Death World within Imperial territory. In mid-M32 during the War of the Beast, the carnivorous trans-plants that were native to this world sent their spores into space, initiating seed-invasions of nearby Imperial Systems.
Rak'Gol	The Rak’Gol are a vicious xeno race of Marauder pirates found in the Koronus Expanse. The slightest mention of their name makes the denizens of the expanse highly superstitious, as it is said to invite the brutal creatures to attack. [1a] Rak’Gol typically possess eight limbs; while not in pursuit, a Rak’Gol will walk upright on four limbs, using the other four for various functions. While chasing prey the Rak’Gol can easily alter its body position so that it can use all eight limbs for locomotion. A Rak’Gol’s upper four limbs are adaptable and can change their musculature to use as hands with opposable digits or as grasping feet. A Rak’Gol’s limbs are strong enough that an adult can climb and run upside down. [1b]. Rak’Gol are large creatures that easily dwarf humans, standing at least 2.6 metres tall and weighing 175 kilograms. Rak’Gol are reptilian in appearance with thick stony hides, two eyes deeply set into the skull, and tympanic-like membranes for hearing. Other common features include keen senses of smell and sight and a prehensile tail to assist in balance. [1b].
Paramours of the Morpheus Rift	The Paramours of the Morpheus Rift are described as a xenos race, being abominations and a horrible threat. It is considered fortunate that they are confined to a small area near the uninhabitable Galactic Core. It is known that the Red Talons Chapter and their Contemptor Dreadnought Skara Brae fought with this vile race.
Horrors of Cilvadia	The Horrors of Cilvadia are a Xenos civilization living in the Laevenir Archipelago under Eldar protection. The race's warriors are known by various types such as 'Velox', The Vice that Grips, 'Persecus', Those With Silent Steps, and 'Fervos'. These forces are divided into units known as Haunts, Shadows, and Penumbras. They are currently engaging the Tyranids in the Laevenir Warzone.
Losh	The Losh are a Xenos race that is believed to have been destroyed by humanity during the Great Crusade.
Overlord (Xenos)	The overlords were a xenos or mutant species that ruled over Barbarus and preyed on the human population that dwelled there. The overlords were pale, corpse-like humanoids, masters of creating golems and other monstrosities. Their exact nature is not known, but according to Barbarus legend they were once human or something like it before being altered by a pact made with a dark power.[2b] If true this would challenge their classification as xenos, but seeing as the species is extinct the question will likely remain unresolved.[Needs Citation] The humans of Barbarus believed the overlords to be immortal[2b] and invulnerable to human weapons[2a]. In reality the overlords were fragile and seemed unsuited to physical combat themselves, relying on their golem armies.[2c] The overlords may have been followers of Nurgle, as implied by Volcral.[2d]
Unsighted Kings	The Unsighted Kings were a Xenos civilization. Encountered in the Akum-Sothos Cluster during the Great Crusade, the Unsighted Kings were a parasitic gestalt cabal that that matured within the eye sockets of its host before gaining control of their body. The parasites threatened Imperial rule in the region, resulting in a large expedition by Horus and Corvus Corax to pacify the Cluster. During the subsequent Battle of Gate Forty-Two the Xenos were defeated though at heavy cost to the Raven Guard.
Varsine	The Varsine are a Xenos species that travel in space vessels known as Worldnests and are known to prey upon the worlds of the Imperium. When a large number of the Xenos migrate together, they are called Varsine Bloodflocks and can threaten to overwhelm entire Sectors of space. When this occurs, only the destruction of their Worldnests will stop their migration. In late M41, a Varsine Bloodflock invaded the Phyleaides Cluster and the Imperium dispatched its forces there, to defeat the Xenos and protect its worlds located within the Cluster.
Muhlari	The Muhlari were an ancient star-faring xenos species said to have possessed knowledge spanning the entire Galaxy. They were exterminated by the Deathwatch and the Ordo Xenos, who ordered that their entire library of data crystals be ground to dust, mixed with crushed Muhlari bone and shot into the heart of a dying sun. The site of their last stand, the fortress of Zarabek, was taken by the Deathwatch to serve as a Watch Fortress.
Has'reel	The Has'reel are a many-limbed Xenos species, which are known to serve as Mercenaries within the Askellon Sector.
Ksathra	The Ksathra are a Xenos race, that battled the Iron Hands in the Durian subsector.
Manal-jarr	The Manal-jarr are said to be a sentient humanoid amphibian Xenos species, who are reputed to have mastered the art of time travel. However there is some doubt, as to whether the species truly exists. While the Xenologist Janus Draik is among those who do not believe so, he was surprised to learn the Aeldari do. They are currently spending valuable time and resources to locate the Manal-jarr's mythical Homeworld, Naub. Draik, however, questions how such a usually well-informed species as the Aeldari, could have fallen for such a hoax.
Thexian	Thexians, also known as Thexian Elite are a biomorphic race few in number, but strong in influence, hailing from the oxidised worlds known as the Bloodmoons of Thex Prime. They are very persuasive, famous as masters of manipulation and have worked themselves into integral positions in the Borlac, Loxatl and Nicassar civilisations. When guile is not enough they are also powerful in battle, their battle forms quite horrifying to behold. Thexians are known to have their own empire, located in the Eastern Fringe, near the Ghoul Stars. Known worlds include:
Adeptus Custodes	The Adeptus Custodes, renowned as the Golden Legion, the Brotherhood of Demigods[Notes], the Golden Brotherhood[Notes], and a host of other titles (The Custodian Guard, The Guardians, the Emperor’s Saints,[36a] the Watchers of The Throne, The Thousand Companions, The Ten Thousand[15a]), but most commonly known as Custodians, are the guardians of the Imperial Palace and the Golden Throne, as well as the personal bodyguard to the Emperor. Due to the vast size of the Imperial Palace, the Custodes always act as a defensive army. Together with the Sisters of Silence they represented the Talons of the Emperor as the right hand of the Emperor with the Sisters as the left.[25f] For much of their history the Custodes rarely left the Imperial Palace and even more rarely left Terra. It is the Adeptus Custodes that decide who may enter the throne room of the Emperor, and when. Such is their authority in this matter that Space Marines and Inquisitors must kneel before them. Custodians are the mightiest of mankind's warriors. They are to the Space Marines what those transhuman warriors are to common guardsmen, an elevated elite whose raw strength and willpower are wholly insurmountable. The Adeptus Custodes were known originally as the Legio Custodes or Custodian Guard. The original Custodians were the first genetically and psychologically altered warriors to appear in the Emperor's armies during the Terran Unification Wars, where they served as the Emperor's personal bodyguard.[4a] The original recruits of the Custodes were from the offspring of Terran nobility. Some of these were later grouped into Squad Dynastes, dubbed the Lords of Terra. The first known appearance of the Custodes was early in the Unification Wars during the fall of the Techno-Barbarian fortress at Nas'sau.[17a] However, the origins of the Custodian Guard are shrouded in myth and legend. During the Great Crusade, the Custodes always kept a contingent with the Emperor for his protection, but also traveled individually as envoys. The Emperor valued the Custodians above all his other warriors, and while he was willing to expend countless servants he was always hesitant to bleed his Praetorians. After the Emperor's internment in the Golden Throne, the Adeptus Custodes took a limited role as protectors of the Imperial Palace, as ordered by Roboute Guilliman in the Edict of Restraint.[22c]
Phra'hadeen	The Phra'hadeen are a Xenos species known to inhabit Space Hulks.
Gullivat	The Gullivat are a Xenos species that once had an advance society, until they regressed into their current primitive state over three thousand years ago. The rare and priceless Gullivat Riddle Boxes, are some of the few items still in existence that were created before the species' fall.
Havat	The Havat are one of the many Xenos species that became extinct, after the Imperium brought the Askellon Sector into Compliance. They were a subterranean and secretive species, which existed on a few of the Thule Sub-Sector's worlds, and ultimately, only appeared a few times in Askellian's history. Most Imperials in the Sector, however, know of the Havat from the Xenos' weapons known as the Havatian Ringblades, which are still in use. Some believe the Havat used the corrosive liquid contained within the Ringblades, to create and maintain their underground civilizations.
Grendel (Xenos)	Grendels (also called Grendel-clones and Grendel-creatures) are non-humanoid xenos lifeforms native to the planetoid of Gath Rimmon. There are several different varieties of the Grendel-creature, but they all share features in common. Seemingly formed from the black rock of Gath Rimmon itself, each Grendel is a fearsome creature standing between one and five metres tall. Each Grendel is protected by rock-like, spiky skin capable of resisting bolter fire and withstanding the acid storms of Gath Rimmon. The beasts are also armed with multiple jagged limbs tipped with talons comparable to lightning claws, along with a mouth full of sharp teeth. In addition, some are capable of flight. The Grendels possess a limited level of intelligence allowing them to recognise intruders and defend their territory. There is no evidence, however, that they are sentient.
Tarschi	The Tarschi were a civilization that existed during the Great Crusade, though it is not known if the humanoids were a Xenos species or an off-shoot of Mankind. They resided on the Tarsch Belt, a string of worlds on the edge of the Crusade's southern front, and resisted the Imperium's efforts to bring their Homeworlds into Compliance. A Luna Wolves strike force led by Captain Verulam Moy was initially sent to destroy the Tarschi, but they were held at bay for several months and eventually the White Scars' Brotherhood of the Moon, led by Torghun Khan, was sent to aid them. Working together the Luna Wolves and White Scars' forces soon destroyed the Tarschi and left their cities in blazing ruins.
Jindarii	The Jindarii are a sentient Xenos species of cunning nomadic and tribal bio-mechanical hunters. They search for areas of space, that will serve as rich hunting grounds for their tribes. Once such an area is found, the Jindarii will consider it to be their territory and the Xenos will build their temple complexes there. The Jindarii will, however, strike outside of their chosen hunting grounds if need be. Their warriors are gathered into Oxalthixduls cadres, which frequently wield highly advanced armaments such as pulsar and needle technology. The cadres also employ guerilla tactics, that utilize bold assaults combined with misdirection. These are calculated to maneuver and trap the Jindarii's enemies, before they are slaughtered without mercy. When a threat is beyond their warriors, though, the Xenos will begin a program to modify their highly adaptable bodies. The results of their experimentation and genetic manipulation, will then be used on the Jindarii's most seasoned warriors to counter the threat they face. While each tribe has their own leader, one will command the entire species in times of war. During the Age of Strife, they established a proving ground in the Sub-sectors neighboring Anvillus. When the world was colonized into a Forge World centuries later, the local Jindarii tribes became galvanized. They then began enacting frequent raids against Anvillus' Mechanicum enclave. While its Taghmata forces defended the Forge World, they stood little chance against the practiced guerilla tactics of the Jindarii's Oxalthixduls cadres. Not only that, but the Xenos' advanced weaponry proved effective at shredding the toughest armor Anvillus could produce. In response to these failures, the Forge World created the Legio Vulpa to protect itself from the Jindarii. Though they were only a Demi-legio and not designed to combat infantry, the Titans of Vulpa successfully invaded the Xenos' hunting grounds. The Legio then attacked the Jindarii's temple complexes there, to draw the Xenos out. After a decade of fighting, Legio Vulpa was able to move their war against the Jindarii, away from Anvillus. While this allowed the Forge World to expand Vulpa's ranks, the Jindarii used their cunning and highly adaptable bodies to counter the Legio's threat. After then undergoing a program of experimentation, the Xenos' warriors were turned into gene-wrought constructs, that rivaled the strength and size of a Titan. While the initial Jindarii Titans lacked ranged weaponry, they compensated for this by having stealth and speed that was at odds with their size. The creations of these Xenos Titans, would cause the Jindarii's conflict with Anvillus to last a further 70 years. During this new phase of the war, Legio Vulpa's military minds conceived and published the first edition of its Libraxus Tacticae Vulpa. It was the Legio's battle bible, which was heavily influenced by the hunting tactics of the Jindarii.
Nadirax Republic	The Nadirax Republic was a Xenos civilization. In mid-M32 during the War of the Beast they were sending new expeditionary fleets against the Imperium.
Iasps	The Iasps are a sentient Xenos species, who are known for their elegant cities.
Mjordhainn Raiders	Mjordhainn Raiders (Kavalaris Cyclopis), are a type of Xenos species native to Thusel Prime. Known to ride steeds dubbed Tchorlau, these clay-like creatures are feared for their ability to seemingly reshape themselves from any wound. They consider creatures of flesh and blood to be a stain on the sacred mudflats of their world and hunt such interlopers relentlessly. At some point, the White Scars are known to have battled the creatures. Thusel Prime has since been terraformed, and evidence of the Raiders existence seems to have vanished.
Tyrama Secundus	Tyrama Secundus is an Ocean World of the Imperium. In 964.M41 a previously unknown xenos species rose from the dark oceans of the planet and began enslaving the human population. In response to the attack, Inquisitor Gruberman led the Imperium's forces in the Tyrama Secundus Campaign, which saw the population saved and the xeno civilization completely destroyed. It is known that Thunderbolts of the 1303rd Imperial Navy Fighter Wing[2a] and Valkyries of the 205th Imperial Navy Tactical Wing fought in the sky of this planet.[2a][2b]
Lehrove	The Lehrove are a Xenos species.
Kibris	The Kibris, also known as Kibris Berserkers, are a sentient humanoid Xenos species, whose tribes are known to be shockingly savage combatants. Their physical attributes suggest a canid ancestry and the Kibris have long heads, bestial snouts and swept-back ears. The Kibris' canines are also so long and sharp that they can tear through Flak Armour. They are known to wield barbed Magnesium Carbines, which fire armour-piercing magnesium rounds, and the Kibris' martial savagery has led some to speculate they must consume some kind of intoxicant before a battle. The Kibris can also enter a berserker state by taking a stimulant that makes them impossible to kill, as it allows them to ignore any wounds they suffer. It is only after the stimulant wears off that any fatally wounded berserkers will finally die. The Kibris once laid claim to Cyrenica, until the world was forcibly taken from them by the T'au Empire.
Machtori Bone-Eaters	The Machtori Bone-Eaters are a mercenary Xenos race.
Sslyth	Sslyth are an alien species that inhabit the galaxy as mercenaries and are typically seen within an Archon's Lord's Retinue. Millennia ago, the race fell before the temptations of unbridled excess and quickly became one of the most favored beings by the Dark Eldar. Their serpentine bodies along with two sets of limbs allow them to carry enough blades along with weapons to quickly dispatch anyone foolish to harm their master. Their scales are hard enough to serve as armor while seemingly being impervious to pain. This along with their skills made them fearsome warrior fiends in combat which is why they are often chosen as a bodyguard detail for an Archon. This is because Dark Eldar make poor bodyguards due to their treacherous nature which is why Sslyth are often recruited from the ranks of the aliens that inhabit the Dark City of Commorragh in order to protect their master from an inevitable coup. While savage in appearance, they in fact possess a great intelligence. The best way to deal with Sslyth is to take advantage of their poor tolerance for cold. Upon exposure to cold temperatures they will fall into a death-like coma.
Nephilim	The Nephilim were a minor but malevolent xenos species encountered on Melchior by the Blood Angels and the Luna Wolves during the Great Crusade. They fed on adoration and worship and subjugated their world's native human population in order to satisfy this hunger.[1a] The Nephilim towered over even Horus, up to twice as tall as a Legionary, and moved slowly, like beasts swimming through water, but could move much faster when fighting. Their native language used hypersonic frequencies and flashes of bio-luminescence, making it impossible to translate. To speak Low Gothic, they utilised an implant to generate a vibrating field to create sounds; this implant could also be used as a sonic weapon. Their hands had three stubby fingers. Their social hierarchy consisted of distinguishing colours of their bloated, oblate bodies: blue "rank and file", green "squad sergeants", and grey "commanders".[1a] The Nephilim fed on adulation. They arrived on worlds and preached of heaven and salvation. Through either psychic manipulation or sheer charisma, the Nephilim converted human populations to their religion. They fashioned masks of their own flesh for their devotees, which were fused to their faces and psychically bonded them together. In turn, the faithful built praise-chapels and copper towers. The Nephilim consumed lives, leaving their faithful as desiccated husks. By the time the Luna Wolves and Blood Angels fought the Nephilim on Melchior, the xenos had stripped worlds of all human life.[1a]
Sytalis	The Sytalis are a sentient serpent Xenos species, that dwell on Matapan V alongside a Human population. They revere the Sytalis as a benign priesthood, despite the Xenos' clear predilection for Human flesh.
Noman	The Noman were a Xenos civilization that enslaved a portion of humanity for millennia during the Age of Strife. During the Great Crusade, their stronghold on Nova Borilia was crushed by the Space Wolves. The STC for the Leman Russ Battle Tank was recovered in the ruins.
Imperial Armour Volume Two - Space Marines and Forces of the Inquisition	Imperial Armour Volume Two - Space Marines and Forces of the Inquisition is part one of The Imperial Armour serie and has 288 pages. This volume focuses on the Imperial Guard, the Imperial Navy, and Imperial Tanks.
Svekka	The Svekka were an arachnoid sentient Xenos species, that once had an empire. However their barbarous and feral nature led them to worship Khorne, as the Svekka were drawn to the brute strength and ferocious aspect of the Chaos God. This would ultimately cause the downfall of the species' empire and it ended in calamitous violence and a vast loss of life.
Phoroki	The Phoroki are a carnivorous Xenos species that has clashed with the T'au Empire. They can not visually register the colour of bright green and the Empire has exploited this weakness when fighting the Phoroki by using the colour on their forces' uniforms for camouflage.
Khosyphane	The Khosyphane are an extinct Xenos race. They possessed a crystal dubbed the Star of Ages, which had tremendous destructive potential. The Necron Mandrakyn Conclave coveted the crystal, and annihilated the Khosyphane to seize it.
Yuranthos	The Yuranthos were a Xenos species. Producing the powerful Psyker Mk'ell, the Yuranthos were wiped out by the being's extreme power. However, Tzeentch has since imprisoned the essence of the Yuranthos into a powerful gem.
Tepresi	The Tepresi are pale, bone-feeding Xenos ambush predators, which use their tentacles to attack prey that are near their brood-dens. The Deathwatch has established effective tactics against them, which include using a Bioscryer to detect the faint surface vibrations the Tepresi cause. Once the Xenos are detected, the Deathwatch approaches them using three approved battle formations, which include the Trisanctic Executor Delta formation. When in range of the Tepresi's tentacles, the Deathwatch use power weapons to sever the appendages and then use the stubs to pull the Xenos out of their brood-dens. They then kill the Tepresi by firing a Hellfire Round into Xenos' brain stems and destroy the brood-dens with gouts of mutagenic acid. Watch Captain Artemis's forces used these tactics to great effect in M42, while destroying the Tepresi infesting a world.
Rangda	The Rangda, also called the Rangdan Cerabvores,[1a] Rangdan Osseivores,[1b] or just Rangdan,[1a] were a violent and powerful Xenos species encountered by the Imperium during the Great Crusade.[1a][4a] They allegedly originated from a homeworld of the same name.[4a] The Rangda were first encountered by the 105th Pioneer Company of the Vth Legion in the northern rim of the Galaxy and were recognized as a grave threat and engaged by the First Legion of Astartes.[4a] During the Rangdan Xenocides, the Rangdan invaded from the galactic north and east. In the bloodiest war for the Imperium until the Horus Heresy the Rangdan were halted, at great cost to the Imperium and the Dark Angels especially.[1a] The Imperium later claimed that it had purged the entire species and their home system in the Third Rangdan Xenocide, but the accounts of these events were highly contradictory.[1a][4a][4c] It seems likely that the Imperial records deliberately or accidentally mislabelled Advex-Mors as "Rangda", the species' capital world.[4c] The Rangdan were described as possessing "Slaugth murder-minds", suggesting they may have been a slave species to the Slaugth species. Indeed, the Slaugth have been seen following the wake of the Rangdan, harvesting the dead and any survivors they come across. The Rangdan were feared for their mimicry abilities, and their ships had a brutal appearance of spines and flails which dragged behind the vessels like metallic tentacles, giving them the appearance of jellyfish. Their elite warriors were said to be the match for a Space Marine in combat, wielding weaponry perhaps even superior to the Imperium and protected by personal energy shielding. Their preferred tactic was to use vast legions of slave armies and send them against the foe, exhausting them until selecting the right moment and place to strike. Their campaigns were conducted by Warmasters while their slave-controlling elite were known as Overlords.[4b]
Rashan	The Rashan are an extinct alien race that were created by the Old Ones to fight the Necrons and the C'tan. The Rashan are speculated to have been created by the Old Ones during the War in Heaven. At this point, the C'tan had allied themselves with the Necrons against the Old Ones, and had beseiged their last bastions. In desperation, the Old Ones manipulated life into new forms with an ever stronger link to the Warp as potential warrior races with the ability to channel psychic power to defend themselves. This is speculated to have included the Rashan, along with the Eldar, the K'nib, and many others. The Rashan were annihilated by the aftermath of the War in Heaven, after which the Eldar penned the Chorale Lilcartha, one of the oldest pieces of ancient Eldar literature known millenia later in M42.
Ur-Ghuls	Ur-Ghuls (Ghala troglodytes) are a Xenos species that are native to the labyrinth ziggurats of the Dark Eldar city of Shaa-dom. Ur-Ghuls are also known to inhabit Blackstone Fortresses. The Ur-ghul nature means that they are one of the many atavistic beings that can be recruited by an Archon for his or her court. These creatures are noted for being the most hideous of all the creatures that a Drukhari Archon can command, and for the violence with which they undertake an Archon's orders. Ur-Ghul migrations are periodically purged by the Deathwatch, most notably one led by the Dreadnought Xenomortis on Plenitia.
Kala Sistrum	The Kala Sistrum are a Xenos species that wield psycho-mobius claw-guns. These weapons were commonly sought after by Blackshields warbands during the Horus Heresy.
Yhemyr Voidshoal	The Yhemyr Voidshoal are a sentient Xenos species, that once resided within a region of space the Necrons turned into the Pariah Nexus. This led the Voidshoal to begin to suffer from the Stilling and their fleets started to flee from the Pariah Nexus, in order to escape the disease. However the Xenos later needed to replenish their food and supplies, to complete their journey, and they are now raiding the Imperial world Kesporia II for supplies. Though the Voidshoal are successfully taking what they need, Kesporia II's Imperial forces are fighting to repel the Xenos and causalities are now high for both sides.
Whisperers	The Whisperers are an ancient insectoid xenos race rumoured to live deep underground in the Drusus Shrine World, also known as Sentinel, and are said to know great truths and secrets of the cosmos. They are named for the brushing sound their wings make, however no evidence or relics of them have ever been found.
Watchers in the Dark	Watchers in the Dark are a diminutive robed race of creatures which inhabit the Rock, the mobile fortress-monastery of the Dark Angels Space Marine Chapter. The Watchers watched over the comatose body of the Dark Angel Primarch Lion El'Jonson within a secret chamber at the core of the Rock. They are semi-unique as they possess a near exclusive ability to resist the warp entities, a trait which is shared with the rare and mysterious Pariahs who completely nullify the warp around them. These silent creatures have been known to carry Dark Angels weapons to battle, and seem to be immune to all acts of violence. Dark Angels accompanied by them are destined to greatness, but they will never give direct aid in battle. Despite their usual silence and small stature, Watchers are intelligent creatures who psychically communicate with one another. They have been seeking to guide the Dark Angels against Chaos since before the Horus Heresy, and are acquainted with the likes of Eldrad Ulthran. The Watchers seemed to welcome the coming Destruction of Caliban, viewing it as their last hope in their ambitions against Chaos.
Thu'l	The Thu'l are a loathsome Xenos species that thrives under the light of dead stars. In 983.M38 they were defeated in battle by the Black Templars and Crimson Sabres Chapters; in what became known as the Deadstar Battles.
Varitoren	The Varitoren are a chitinous Xenos species, which are known to serve as Mercenaries within the Askellon Sector.
Olamic Quietude	The Olamic Quietude was a hostile post-human civilization that the 40th Expedition Fleet and the Space Wolves Third Company encountered during the Great Crusade. From first contact, they considered the Imperium of Man a mockery of humanity. The Quietude considered itself the rightful successors to Terra and saw Imperials as xenos-infected impostors. As a result, the Quietude captured and vivisected the first Imperial emissaries, resulting in war between the two civilizations. The inhabitants of the Quietude were implanted with bionics from birth to integrate them into their social network. By the time they reached adulthood, their augmentations encompassed their entire bodies, leaving only the brain, skull, and spinal cord. Synthetic organs supported the remaining organic components with a purple circulatory fluid. Their faces were holographic images. The Quietude's elite soldiers were called Robusts. When attacked, the Robusts' social network analyzed the method of attack and modulated their force field defenses to adapt. Their weapons consisted of gravity penetrators and heat rays similar to melta weapons. Gigantic Super Robusts, equipped with concussion maces and accelerator hammers, defended the social network's nexus. Some Super Robusts had two sets of arms and two heads.
Scaephylyds	The Scaephylyds are an insectoid race which dwell upon the Daemon World of Draakasi. Scaephylyds have many limbs and an insectoid carapace. They have mandibles and many eyes. They are upright, with a human-like torso and can grow to great sizes as they age. Scaephylyds appear to be the indigenous inhabitants of Draakasi. When humans arrived on the planet the Scaephylyds either went into hiding or were enslaved. At some point the human champion of Khorne Venalitor rallied the Xenos to his banner and introduced them to the worship of the Skull Throne. The Scaephylyds are now Venalitor's willing slaves and serve him in any way he sees fit.
Syrshin	The Syrshin are primitive reptile xenos that inhabit the Black Heart System in the Jericho Reach. They are believed to be descendants of an ancient, advanced, but now extinct xenos race of the same system. Due to the strange nature of the Black Heart the Syrshin are capable of flying between planets, and according to their ruins they are waiting for an ancient enemy that would soon return from its slumber to enslave them.
Umbra	The Umbra are an alien species appearing as smooth black spheres with swirling patterns that live in the void of space, often observed attracted to areas resonant of the warp such as starship hulls and warp engines or suspected entrances to the Eldar Webway. They can manipulate and control shadows to form terrifying limbs of hooks, blades, teeth and other nightmarish shapes.[1a] The Umbra are not an organism in the standard sense, as no obvious means of motion, respiration, digestion nor excretion are evident. They are comprised of an outer shell made of an unknown glossy, brittle and untextured substance showing swirling pearlescent patterns. An inner cavity is below this and surrounds a liquid core of impossible to analyse white liquid that appears non-Newtonian, prone to random solidification and variation in density, and seems to be frictionless.[1a] The Umbra can manipulate areas of shadow like oil to form shadow-limb weapons seen as hooks, blades, teeth and the like. The umbra are also capable of movement in space and are able to hover in place for an unknown ammount of time. The motion and swirling pattern of the Umbra shell become inert upon death.[1a]
Xshesian	The Xshesians were a race of small insectoid Xenos belonging to the Cabal. They could speak many languages fluently. One of them, G'Lattro, served as a translator between the Cabal and John Grammaticus, and later to outsiders like the Primarch Alpharius of the Alpha Legion.
Unification (Short Story)	Unification is a Death Guard short story. Despite the 40.000 branding, it takes place entirely before and during Horus Heresy. Vorx, captain of the second cohort from the Death Guard Legion's third company, has been by his primarch's side for many years. From the beginnings of Mortarion's rebellion against the Pale Kings on Barbarus, to the mighty wars of the Great Crusade, to the walls of the Imperial Palace itself, he has fought, silent and implacable. Even when faced the scorn of warriors from other Space Marine Legions, he has been silent. On Terra, his silence will end, as he faces a warrior he first encountered many years before on a distant battlefield.
Tyrama Secundus Campaign	In 964.M41 a previously unknown Xeno species rose from the dark oceans of Tyrama Secundus and began enslaving the Human population, dragging millions to a water demise. In response to the attack Inquisitor Gruberman of the Ordo Xenos, alongside the Subjugators Chapter and the Deathwatch, led a xenocidal campaign against the ocean dwelling Xenos to reclaim the world for the Imperium. By the end of the campaign, the Xenos were extinct and their oceanic cyclopean fane-cities were destroyed.[1a] It is known that Valkyries of the 205th Imperial Navy Tactical Wing fought during this conflict. One of the vehicles bore name "Imperious" and number "494684". Also there fought Inquisitor Aethia who managed to induct the entire 2987th Imperial Navy Tactical Assault Wing with their Valkyries to provide transport to her warriors.[1b]
Togoran Bloodreek	The Togoran Bloodreeks are a xenos species that inhabit the Ghoul Stars. They are described as fierce creatures who favor close combat.
General	General is a high rank within the Imperial Guard. Generals are high-ranking officers who are also members of the General Staff. General is one of the most prestigious ranks within the Imperial Guard and those bear the title are usually highly decorated and experienced commanders who have been on countless campaigns throughout their career. However other Generals are sometimes arrogant individuals who have been promoted due to the pedigree of their homeworld. These officers are often placed in charge of newly founded Regiments tithed to a Crusade. Historically, General was also a rank in the Imperial Army.
Rykogene	The Rykogene were a Xenos species that was encountered by the Imperium in the Great Crusade, and which later attempted to kill the Emperor during a boarding attack on his flagship, the Bucephelus. The attempt failed; following this, the Imperium launched a campaign of annihilation against the Rykogene, which caused their species's extinction.
Scythe (Xenos)	The Scythe are an alien species that were defeated by the Imperium. After the Badab War, Ordo Xenos Inquisitor Parnival Gründvald described that the Imperium had defeated the Scythe, among many other Xenos and other threats.
Vyggh	The Vyggh were an ancient primitive and brutal alien race. According to Eldar mythology, they were mercilessly eradicated by Asuryan in their infancy before they became a threat to the Eldar race.
Vordori Flayers	Vordori Flayers are a Xenos species, that clashed with the Imperium, during the Indomitus Crusade. They go to war aboard bladeships and several of these attempted to destroy Fleet Quartus's Task Force II, near the Space Station Agrippus. A plea for aid was sent out to the Deathwatch, which sent the Strike Cruiser Pyre Imperius to help the Task Force. Before it arrived, though, the Flayers' bladeships were destroyed by the sudden appearance of the ghostly Battleship Blade of Judgement.
Zlasslr Empire	The Zlasslr Empire was a Xenos empire that fought the Imperium, during the Great Crusade. Among the forces that did so, was Legio Audax and this led the Empire to target the Legio's fleet. While the Zlasslr were repelled, boarding attacks by the Empire's Voidsingers, corrupted the STC patterns aboard Audax's Explorator Arks. These Arks were used to produce Titans, for the fleet-bound Legio. Though retro-engineering efforts allowed Legio Audax to retain its capabilities to produce Warhound and other Scout Titans, the larger classes were lost to it. The Zlasslr Empire itself, was eventually destroyed by the Imperium.
Uluméathic	The Uluméathic are a race of aliens that form part of the Uluméathic League, a fledgling empire that had, before their encounter with the Tyranids, begun to encroach on Imperial space. The worlds of the Uluméathic League would be ravaged by the Tyranid Hive Fleet Naga. Beginning its invasion in 801.M41, the Uluméathic outer colonies were devoured in a matter of days while Genestealers managed to stowaway on fleeing refugee ships, leading to a Genestealer infestation on the Varryean Space Docks.[2a] In 809.M41, the throne world of the Uluméathic League was devoured by the advancing Tyranids and the remaining Uluméathi worlds declared a state of quarantine. Fortunately for the Uluméathi, Eldar forces from the Malan'tai, Iyanden, and Idharae Craftworlds managed to destroy the Hive Fleet by 812.M41.[2b] In light of the devastation suffered by the Uluméathic League it is unlikely they will pose anywhere near the same threat that they did before the arrival of the Hive Fleet. Indeed, it seems humanity considers the Uluméathic all but destroyed by the end of the 41st Millennium. The League possesses a form of energy energy containment technology that resembles technology found in the Soulburner Petards of Chaos Decimators, though a connection is impossible to prove.
Yu'vath	The Yu'vath were a Warp-worshipping xenos species, who built an empire of corrupted humans, and were defeated in the Angevin Crusade, together with the Bale Childer, after the homeworlds of both species were destroyed by Exterminatus. They were the last resistance to Imperial rule in the Calyx Expanse, which signaled the end of the Angevin Crusade and the birth of the Calixis Sector. Prior to the fourth century of the 39th millennium, the Yu'vath were a blight upon the Calyx Expanse, enslaving worlds through the use of vile sorcery. They are known to have expended the lives and souls of corrupted human slaves in order to build the horrors such as the Calyx Hell Worlds. During the Angevin Crusade, the warp-ridden Yu'vath with their tormented slaves armies were sent to battle the Imperial Crusade forces and bled them for decades until the xenos' ultimate extinction at the hands of General Drusus and the Adeptus Astartes. In the aftermath of the Angevin Crusade, the Yu'vath, alongside the remains of their xenos slave armies, as well as their techno-warp constructs, were scattered. These weapons of war were broken and dying across the Expanse, all of which serve as grim reminders of this dark empire that are hidden in the shadowy corners of the void and are seemingly lost forever.[4a] The starships of the Yu'vath are made of incomprehensible construction and do not seemingly require the same components as more mundane craft. Their Warp technology utilises components that are not powered in a way that could be understood by humans. Among the components used by their vessels include Gravity Sails that can touch the forces that bind stellar systems together thus allowing the ship to move with agility as well as grace.[4d]
Sheed	The Sheed are a Xenos race, known to attack worlds of the Imperium.
Zaruk	The Zaruk are a sentient piratical Xenos species, who have developed advanced weaponry by stealing ideas from everyone they conquer. Encountered in the Uhulis Sector, they use fleets of Warp-capable void ships, powered by Dihedral Loop technology. The Zaruk also wear elaborate, oversized suits of armor that appear to be made from the bones of large, predatory reptiles. As a result of this, little is known of their anatomy beyond that the Zaruk are bipedal and vaguely humanoid in shape.
Rethari	The Rethari are a Xenos species, and some of its members, known as Bloodhunters, serve as Bounty Hunters in the Imperium.
The Alien Hunters (Short Story)	A squad of alien hunters from the elite and secretive Deathwatch descend upon the Teramus system, intent upon the destruction of alien pirates who have been ravaging the area, preying upon citizens of the Imperium. As they stalk their quarry through the system’s asteroid fields, Sergeant Courlanth and his kill-team discover that there are secrets and lies at work in Teramus, and that their mission may be more complicated than they know.
The Horus Heresy Book One - Betrayal	ISBN 9781788266086 (2014 softback edition) The Horus Heresy Book One - Betrayal is the first book in the Horus Heresy series created by the Forge World game studio.[1a] The book deals with the events starting from the end to the Great Crusade until the Battle of Isstvan III. It contains rules and special characters for the pre-Heresy Sons of Horus, World Eaters, Emperor's Children, and Death Guard as well as a Space Marine Crusade Legion army list.[1a]
W'ral Ath	W'ral Ath was a Xenos Empire that was destroyed by the Imperium's 3686th Expedition Fleet, during the latter years of the Great Crusade.
Vibis	The Vibis are a sentient Xenos species of morays, which dwell beneath the oceans of their Homeworld Lugodor, in vast cities they allegedly built. The species does not know, however, that the Imperium is aware of their existence and is merely waiting to gather together the resources it needs to destroy the Vibis.
Psy-Gore	The Psy-Gore are a race associated with a crystalline handgun from Perseus.
Ujvar	The Ujvar are Xenos sentient species of revenants, that dwell on the moon Abarym, which is located within the Zacca System. They have no flesh of their own, but cloth themselves in the skins of their defeated foes.
Verminthiculians	The Verminthiculians are a wild mercenary and reaver Xenos species that has fought against the Imperium.
Keylekid	The Keylekid were a xenos species apparently wiped out by the Luna Wolves Space Marine Legion during the Great Crusade. Approximately 123 years into the Great Crusade, the Luna Wolves discovered the world of Keylek, and the species that called it home, the Keylekid. A reptilian race, the average Keylekid was large and strong (in comparison to an Astartes), requiring three or four rounds from a bolt weapon to permanently put down. Hathor Maat, a Captain of the Thousand Sons who was seconded to the Luna Wolves during the campaign, described the Keylekid as "dragons." Expecting a prolonged struggle against such formidable foes, the commander of the Luna Wolves forces, Horus Lupercal himself, was surprised by what happened next. The Keylekid, rather than following through on the initial combat generated by first contact, instead assembled in large pre-existing staging-grounds all over their domain and awaited the arrival of the Luna Wolves. It transpired that the Keylekid had developed an advanced philosophy concerning the detestation of war and had restricted and regulated armed combat in such a way that it was kept contained within slaughterhouses, the staging-areas observed by the Astartes. These slaughterhouses resembled roofed, open-walled structures several kilometres in area.
Warp Gate	Warp Gates are points located in real space connected to another such region by way of a tunnel that travels through the Warp. They were constructed by ancient Humanity during the Dark Age of Technology and the workings of them are not understood by the Imperium. These tunnels are somehow known to be able to avoid the disturbances of warp space thus allowing a journey to be made both safely as well as during a fixed time. A great mystery surrounded these gates as there was speculation on whether they were natural phenomena or an artificially created event. If the latter, a further question was asked on who were the creators of warp gates and what was their intended purpose. Some gates are known to be artificially enhanced as they contain mechanical constructions that delineated their entrances though their exact function could only be guessed at. Their one disadvantage is the fact that their destination is pre-determined and permit travel only within the fixed lane. Some warp gates are little more than black holes in space. It is known that warp gates come in various different sizes and can occur either in the depths of space outside the boundaries of the solar system, within such systems or even on planets. Among the largest of these phenomena allow the passage of starships with these versions being situated either on the edge of a solar system or amongst its outer planets. Other such gates are only large enough to allow the passage of small vehicles or even human sized creatures through them. Such versions are typically found on planetary surfaces and can lead to another gate located on another world where they respond only to electrical, psychic or other form of signal. This has led some to believe that a level of secrecy was intended in their function on the part of the builders of such gates. Regardless of type, all forms of warp gates are rare with the smaller types being even rarer.
Zygo	The Zygo are a Xenos species that dwell on the world of Camgia. Noted warriors, they have fought off Imperial invasions for the last 500 years. They are described as enigmatic creatures who practice the slave trade.
Viskeon	The Viskeon are a xenos race. Noted for their regenerative abilities, Viskeons are ectotherms, absorbing their heat and energy from their surrounding environment. Their home world was once hot and parched, wreathed in endless deserts, impenetrable jungles and sweeping plains, a perfect environment for a cold-blooded species. The Viskeons were a proud, martial race, whose warrior code did not permit the use of ranged weaponry. To face an opponent in bladed battle was seen as the supreme honor and anything else was unthinkable. Many of the Viskeons plied their trade as mercenaries, bounty hunters and the like, and their skill at arms was highly valued. But all that was for naught in the face of the Tyranid menace. A Tyranid Splinter Fleet of Hive Fleet Kraken that had broken off from Ichar IV devoured the planet in a single night and exterminated their whole race save those who were off-world. Among the survivors was the mercenary Krashrak the Stalker. A Viskeon Foetus-limb, a severed adult limb that partially regenerated its former body into an unformed foetus before it died, was studied by Magos Biologis Sharve Darvus.
Gruberman	Gruberman is an Inquisitor, of the Ordo Xenos, who led the successful Tyrama Secundus Campaign, which saw the world saved from an attacking Xeno species dwelling in its oceans.
Space Station	A Space Station is a spaceborne construction that usually (but not always) is placed in orbit around a planet, moon, or other such celestial body. They can be equipped with support facilities for population, trade, defense, and spacecraft repair and resupply. Star Forts are particularly large and well-armed space stations, and often act as the home base for major war fleets.
Jotun Repression	The Jotun Repression was a battle between Task Force Naasirka, dispatched from the Praetors of Orpheus Chapter, and the forces of the turncoat Imperial Guard General Lord Kazanlak in 932.M39. It was only near the end of the battle that the true cause of Kazanlak's rebellion was discovered by the Space Marines. An endoparasitical Xeno life form had spawned within Kazanlak's skull, where it gained control of his body and began slowly consuming his soul. When the truth was revealed, Kazanlak's army turned upon their traitorous master and were later granted a pardon by Task Force Naasirka's Commander.
Index Astartes IV	Index Astartes IV is the finale volume in the in the Index Astartes series.
Kinebrach	The Kinebrach were an obscure xenos species.[2a] The Kinebrach were hefty, simian aliens with sunken eyes and big brow ridges. Their mouth and nose were one organ, and their mouths were filled with many small teeth. The skin of the Kinebrach was blue-black in color with thrums of russet hair resembling feathers. Kinebrach had angular, heavy craniums, and a strange and distinctive smell.[2a] Xenoarchaeological research indicates that, of the multiple Xenos species that occupied the Fortress Worlds in the Segmentum Pacificus, prior to the Imperium, the Kinebrach occupied them for the longest period (ca. M15-M31).
Hellgrammite	The Hellgrammite were a mysterious and powerful xenos empire based out of the Laanah Rifts. Their true name is unknown and is only a title given by Imperial soldiers, for they showed no interest in communication with humans and were extremely hostile. Described as foul anthropoid creatures with decayed physical forms, they possessed sinister occult-infused weaponry and rode into battle on the backs of bio-mechanical monsters and abominations capable of ripping through heavy armor with ease. During the Bellrath Crusade into the Lanaath Region in early to mid M38, the Imperium attempted to subdue the Hellgrammite but found it extremely difficult. Their throneworld of Wormgyre was protected by a protective shield of Warp-fire known as "Aetheric Fire", making any approach impossible. However thanks to advanced technology provided by the Adeptus Mechanicus, the warships of the Sons of Medusa were able to penetrate Wormgyre's shield of Aetheric Fire and launch a direct on the Hellgrammite's center. In the ensuing attack in which the Xenos were caught by complete surprise, the Hellgrammite homeworld was reduced to ruin and the survivors of the race itself scattered throughout the stars.
Q'orl	The Q'Orl, also known scientifically as Bestiola Superior, are a type of intelligent, advanced insectoid aliens that lived in the galaxy and were native to the Swarmworld Loqiit, located in the Segmentum Pacificus. Commonly held theory holds the view that the Q'Orl are the evolutionary descendants of primitive invertebrates of lifeforms native to their homeworld of Loqqit. Whilst all are born equal, there were several distinct strains that are developed within the larval nurseries. This was done so through the use of hormonal soups exuded by the queen which is responsible for siring the entirely male race by laying several thousand eggs every day. At an unknown point, they developed space travel capabilities where they created elegant chainships. In time, they developed unbelieved advanced spacevessels and became heavily armed though lacked Warp travel capability. As they expanded into space, they began placing planetary marker-stones, deep-space monoliths and archaeological sites containing a rich amount of Q'Orl text. These texts all proclaim the announcement of the "Superiority of the Swarmhood", their ownership of select regions of space and their ultimate aim conquering the Galactic hub. Their empire was known as the Q'Orl Swarmhood and they were centered around their single holy world. According to one text, four thousand years ago at the end of the 37th Millennium they became afflicted with some form of disease that may be Chaotic in origin. It is speculated that the disease was transmitted originally from Human settlers and may be attributed to Nurgle. During this time, they were assisted against this disease or Chaos by another race which some believe may be the Eldar. After the war was won, the pointy ears allied demanded payment which was a Q'Orl queen to make an "uncorroded swarm"; possibly a race resistant to disease or Chaos. This saw the Q'Orl dissolve their alliance and defend their queen though the Eldar conduct a treachorous act that steals away the queen. Despite the loss of the queen, a newly formed queen-egg was laid bringing the reign of the next matriarch though the Q'Orl never forgived the Eldar for their actions.
Imperial Knights	Imperial Knights are towering bipedel engines of war that hail from feudal worlds of the Imperium known as Knight Worlds. Each Knight is piloted by a single Noble pilot from within the Throne Mechanicum.[11c] Knights which are sworn to the service of the Emperor are known as Questor Imperialis. Knights which are sworn to the Omnissiah are known as Questor Mechanicus.[11c] Knights themselves are operated from Knight Households, also known as Questoris Familia, located on Knight Worlds. Pilots of Knights are known as Knight Scions. The original Knight Worlds were founded during the Dark Age of Technology, settled by Humanity in its first great stellar exodus. In an event dubbed the Long March, over the course of decades colonization ships reached their pre-chosen worlds. When they arrived however, they found often lethal wildlife and plant-life alike, or devastating meteorological conditions. The founding materials for the colonists were the ship themselves, while they were able to flourish and expand thanks to STC machines. Among the creations of the STC during this time were the first Knight suits to defend against predators and hostile Xenos. The pilots for these suits were carefully chosen, but over extended exposure to their Throne Mechanicum console their concepts of practical self-defense and communal survival was replaced by ideas of authoritarianism, chivalry, and martial honor. Over the decades a feudal system formed, and those protected by the Knights increasingly became vassals to their masters.[11a] Later during the Age of Strife, Mars sent out many expeditions of spacecraft, hoping to find remnants of human knowledge on other worlds. They found an anarchic galaxy where the ancient confederacy of interdependent human planets no longer existed. The human worlds discovered retained little of their old technology. They had devolved into feudal states ruled by aristocratic nobles who welcomed the Techpriests as long-awaited saviours. The Tech-priests settled among these feudal empires, or Knight Worlds, choosing planets that were mineral rich where they could rebuild their industries. They established contacts with the Knights, trading with their worlds and investigating the ancient ruins where surviving technology could still sometimes be found. The Knights provided manpower and security against enemies such as marauding Orks and land-hungry Eldar Exodites. In return the Tech-priests provided technical expertise and help rebuilding their planets.
Echoing Vault	The Echoing Vault is a mysterious artifact. In M32 the artifact was uncovered by an Explorator fleet deep within the Halo Stars. Its origin is unknown, but it quickly unleashed a wave of horrors never seen before by the Imperium. These xenoforms were dubbed "The Harrowing" and violated the laws of physics, causing those even within their proximity to die or be driven insane. They ravaged all in their path for several years, creating unprecedented losses for the Adeptus Astartes and Inquisition as well as other Xenos factions. Ultimately, it is said that an Inquisition faction found that the creatures could be contained with a fusion of archaeotech and Sorcerous lore. Defeated, the creatures fled back to the Echoing Vault and the Mechanicum used a Dark Age-era forbidden weapon to seal the breach the device created.
Kor (Xenos Species)	The Kor are a sentient aquatic and warlike Xenos species, who dwell on their ocean Homeworld Deultus.
Lelith (Race)	The Lelith were an alien race who once fought the Dark Angels Successor Chapter, the Guardians of the Covenant. The Space Marines were able to rescue a sub-sector from a Lelith incursion.
Therion (Xenos Species)	The Therion are a Xenos sentient species of large blubbery bipeds, whose tusks reach from their mouths to their waists. They also have an innate psychic ability to assume the forms of other species and can mask their void ships in a similar way as well.
Groevian Fiend	The Groevian Fiends are a reptilian race known for its skill in bounty-hunting, often acting as mercenaries and assassins.
Vrakk	The Vrakk are a Xenos race that is believed to have been destroyed by humanity during the Great Crusade.
Hykosi	The Hykosi are a xenos-species that the Death Guard fought against during the Great Crusade.
Nin'aenh	The Nin'aenh are a Xenos species, that posses the uncanny ability to scramble electrical systems with a single touch. They were defeated in a brutal war with the Tau Empire, who has since tried to integrate the Nin'aenh's ability with their technology. The research done by the Tau's Earth Caste has resulted in the creation of Advanced EM Scramblers.
Mitu	The Mitu were a race of Xenos that dominated the Coronid Reach region of Segmentum Obscurus during the Age of Strife. This tyrannical empire, known as the Mitu Conglomerate, ruled both Human and other xenos worlds. The Mitu were pseudo-actinaric psychic beings who are believed to have evolved from common livestock. They were capable of manipulating the Warp thanks to advanced technologies which were biological in nature. They forbid any attempt of space travel by the enslaved worlds of their pocket empire and viciously purged all Psykers they came across. The Mitu were known to periodically cull the population of their slave worlds and demand a tribute of flesh which is believed to have powered their arcane technologies. During the Great Crusade, the Mitu battled against an invasion by the newly formed Imperium of Man. The conflict was largely fought in space and consisted of brutal close-quarters boarding engagement. Ultimately, the conflict required three Space Marine Legions including the Imperial Fists and hundreds of Solar Auxilia Cohorts. The Mitu were crushed and their worlds subjected to Exterminatus, while the enslaved human planets were liberated and reformed into the Manachean Commonwealth.
Cybernetica (Novella)	Cybernetica is a novella by Rob Sanders in the Horus Heresy series. It was published in July 2015. Soon after word reached Terra of Horus's nascent rebellion, Mars fell. Rogue elements within the Mechanicum priesthood, stirred by the Warmaster's promises of independence and prosperity, turned against the Imperium and forced the primarch Rogal Dorn to order an impenetrable blockade of the Red Planet. Now it has become clear that the corruption has spread too deep, and that more drastic measures must be taken if the Forge World Principal is to be reclaimed. Calling upon the expertise of those who witnessed the so-called "Death of Innocence" firsthand, Lord Dorn and Malcador the Sigillite consider their final solution - the complete extermination of all life on Mars. The XIX Legion 'Raven Guard'
Unkerhi	The Unkerhi were a race mentioned in the The Chronicles of Ursh. They were supposedly evil and were defeated by the "Thunder Warrior". Supposedly their remains became a range of mountains somewhere on the Merican continent.
Vorchik	The Vorchik are a sentient Xenos species. 3 of their Subjugation Korps were among the various Xenos forces, that took part in the Charadon Campaign.
Jokaero	The Jokaero are an alien race, ape-like in appearance who are capable of tremendous technological and logical feats, and who also specialize in miniaturisation technology. During the closing days of the War in Heaven, after having already nurtured many species to assist them (including the Eldar), the then-desperate Old Ones brought forth newer creations to defend the last of their strongholds. These creations included the green-skinned Krork and the technology mimicking Jokaero. Regardless of their efforts, the Old Ones were doomed when their intergalactic network was breached by psychic spawn of their creations. Despite the destruction of their creators, the Jokaero continued to live on and into the Age of the Imperium where there was much speculation about their origins. The physical resemblance of the Jokaero to orangutans of ancient Terra may not be coincidental, because it is established fact that the Slann have genetically manipulated the species as they are known to have visited the planet on numerous occasions. In appearance, they are heavyset, orange-furred apes who bear a passing resemblance to orangutans of ancient Terra with retractable fingers and toes. Their physical form can be misleading to outsiders as they are technosavants without equal. They have proven to be a fascinating species to outsiders as none are sure whether they are truly intelligent despite the fact that they are capable of remarkable acts of engineering, construction and problem solving. This is, in fact, their most notable ability as they are technically brilliant with an innate, genetically structured understanding of technology. Their capabilities are seemingly instinctive giving them a full understanding of machinery and technology. These traits place their understanding beyond that of even the most advanced of the known races with the possible exception of the Great Mages of the Slann. Great debates emerged on whether these simians were genuinely intelligent or simply made weapons on an instinctual basis.
Simulacra	The Simulacra are an alien race capable of shape-shifting by ingesting other's brains, gaining their skills and memories in the process. These capabilities degrade as the brain is digested, until they lose the ability to do so after the brain is fully digested, which takes roughly four weeks. The existence of the simulacra seems to be confined to the Calixis Sector, specifically the Malfian Sub-sector with a high concentration of hiveworlds.
Inquisitor Rulebook	The Inquisitor Rulebook is the core rulebook for Games Workshop's Inquisitor game.[1c] It was first released in may 2001. This chapter describes rules and gameplay, as well as detailing characters and their abilities.[1c] A descriptive list of the weaponry available to the characters in the game.[1d]
Oura'Nuoama	Oura'Nuoama is an Imperial world, that was once home to a Xenos civilization. This came to an end, however, during the Great Crusade, when the Primarch Mortarion led a successful invasion of the world, with an Imperial strike force. It consisted of the Death Guard's Third Great Company, led by Captain Venarus Graganda, as well as a much smaller force of Imperial Knights and Blood Angels, led by Captain Camanio, which destroyed the Xenos. Afterwards, the Imperium then terraformed Oura'Nuoama, to rid the world of its toxic atmosphere and burn away its oceans.
Stryxis	The Stryxis are a race of wandering xenos traders that many consider to be untrustworthy. In 789.M41, they established the so-called Rust Palace, a permanent presence in the asteroids and system on the edge of the God-Emperor's Scourge storm, in the Koronus Expanse, though most roam the region as nomadic tribes in fleets of barely space-worthy ships trading anything they feel to be of interest. None truly know the origins of this species that have a reputation for being wanderers, traders, merchants and keepers of secrets. Their scattered nomadic tribes roam as bands throughout the region of the Koronus Expanse where they make their way through the stars in order to trade with all those they encounter. The Stryxis have since developed a reputation for being untrustworthy scoundrels but despite this there are many who still deal with them, should they manage to overcome their aversion to the Stryxis's hideous appearance. The only known home of these xenos is their ramshackle, barely-operable caravans of voidships. It is widely known that these xenos take any remotely space-worthy vessel that they can find, whereupon they convert it into a viable vessel for their needs. Encounters with the Stryxis are infrequent in the region of the Koronus Expanse though they still maintain a dark reputation. Stryxis are known to hold contacts that span the Koronus Expanse and even beyond its boundaries. Despite their reputation, Rogue Traders that do not mind speaking with the xenos race engage Stryxis Caravans, due to the opportunities for commerce and profit. In addition, they serve as treasure troves of information, legends and secrets for Rogue Traders if they have the wit to separate the truth from the lies. In terms of appearance, the Stryxis appear truly hideous to human eyes: described as resembling a human-sized, skinned dog embryo, with gangling stature and bony talons on the digits of their limbs. Typically, they wear swathes of ragged bone-coloured cloth, adorned with trinkets. An oddity amongst their kind is that there does not appear to be any gender variation and their young have not been encountered by outsiders. As such, outsiders do not know how these xenos breed and the Stryxis themselves tend to avoid discussing this topic. Their pugnacious faces have an upturned nose that is faintly reminiscent of Terran bulldogs with four small, beady eyes.
Strinx	The Strinx are a former client race of the Yu'vath formed by near-microscopic crystalline colonies. These beings have very little that would be recognized as a civilization by humanity, surviving on barren asteroids throughout the Koronus Expanse. During the Angevin Crusade tens of thousands of these colonies formed key parts of the Yu'vath fleet, but when their masters were defeated the individual groups separated and became isolated. Currently the Ordo Xenos no longer classifies these groups as sentient, though ancient records suggest that the colonies could become a significant threat once again when in the presence of specific xenos tech.
Kazanlak	Lord Kazanlak was a turncoat Imperial Guard General, whose forces fought Task Force Naasirka, dispatched from the Praetors of Orpheus Chapter, in 932.M39. Near the end of the battle it was discovered that Kazanlak's rebellion against the Imperium, was caused by a Xeno parasite that had gained control of his body. When the truth was revealed, Kazanlak was killed by his once loyal forces.
Strousii	The Strousii are a Xenos species which trained the Rogue Trader Gorgone Locke, on how to use one of their strousine neural scourge weapons.
Great Crusade	The Great Crusade (~798.M30 — 005.M31) was a brief age of rebuilding and reunification following the complete regression of mankind during the Age of Strife. It was a time when the Emperor still lived in the conventional sense and led his race in person. It followed the Emperor's conquest of Terra in the Unification Wars and lasted roughly from the conquest of Earth's moon to the Battle of Isstvan III and the beginning of the Horus Heresy. Part of the Emperor's vision of human unification was the Primarch Project, meant to be the creation of 20 superhumans to lead the Emperor's forces to reclaim the galaxy in his name. It also saw the creation of the Space Marine Legions from the gene-seed samples that survived the scattering of the Primarchs by the Chaos gods. These forces would play the major role in the upcoming Great Crusade alongside the Imperial Army, Titan Legions, Legio Cybernetica, Sisters of Silence, and Custodian Guard. The subsiding of the warp storms plaguing much of the galaxy coincided with the end of the Age of Strife. With warp travel feasible again, the Emperor was able to begin the Great Crusade which would create the Imperium. Even before the warp storms and the Age of Strife had ended, the Emperor had begun to make plans for the Great Crusade. These plans included the creation of a far more advanced form of power armour required for the conditions of deep space and alien worlds.
Warhammer 40,000 4th Edition Rulebook	Warhammer 40,000 4th Edition Rulebook is the 4th core rulebook for the Warhammer 40,000 game published in August 2004. It was released as both a hardback book and in a reduced format in the Battle for Macragge boxed set. This edition of the rulesset has relatively few differences to its predecessor so almost all codexes and supplements produced for the Warhammer 40,000 3rd Edition Rulebook are compatible. The lore sections took a much more objective look at the background of the 40k universe, yet still remained largely focused on the Imperium of Man's perspective. The cover depicts a skull across a hammer against a dark abstract background illustrated by Karl and Stefan Kopinski. This cover is notable for the having the Roman numeral 'IV' emblazoned on the skull, making this the only edition released thus far that includes the edition's number somewhere on the book.
Naiad Republic	The Naiad Republic are a Xenos civilisation known to be peace-loving. This made them prime targets for the murderous Dark Eldar, whose Kabal of the Black Sun launched a series of large-scale terror attacks on the Republic in 117.M40 with technology derived from the research of Vorsch.
Inquisitor	Inquisitors are members of the Inquisition, the organization responsible for investigating and dealing with all potential threats to the Imperium and to humanity.[1a] Potential Inquisitors come from all walks of life, from humble agri-workers' sons to highborn nobles' daughters, but are usually drawn from the Progena of the Schola Progenium who show the most promise. As is the case with all other aspects of the Inquisition, the power to recruit is not centralized, but left in the hands of individual Inquisitors. Some are known to not recruit at all and instead spend their years of service in pursuit of their enemies and dedicate their hours to duty for the rest of their lives. Others, however, feel that it is one of their many burdens to bring about the next generation of Inquisitors who are destined to carry forth the battle that the Inquisition must wage. Ultimately, the matter is left to the judgment of the individual Inquisitors, who are subject only to the scrutiny of their peers. A majority of Inquisitors typically leave matters to chance or perhaps to fate in regard to picking a suitable candidate from amongst the groups of individuals whose paths cross that of the Inquisition. There are a number of Inquisitors who are more rigorous in regard to the pursuit of apprentices and will spend a proportion of their time seeking suitable candidates - sometimes from the ranks of other Imperial organizations.
Taragonna	The Taragonna are a Xenos species.
Gresk'a	The Gresk'a are a migrating Xenos species known to attack Imperial worlds. The Deathwatch try to prevent this by using cogitators and their Librarians to locate and intercept bands of Gresk'a.
Scorvidian	The Scorvidian were a Xenos species in the Segmentum Solar whose Empire was destroyed by Imperial forces led by the Emperor during the early years of the Great Crusade.
Those Who Evade the Crone	Those Who Evade the Crone are a mysterious Xenos race that dwells within the Laevenir Archipelago. The race possesses some sort of time dilation ability that can interfere with even the tracking ability of Eldar Farseers. Existing under Eldar protection, when Tyranid Hive Fleet Ouroboris attacked the Laevenir Archipelago the Eldar worried what would happen if the Great Devourer were to absorb the DNA of the creatures. This prompted the Eldar to attempt to repel the Tyranids.
Xenology (Background Book)	Xenology is a Warhammer 40,000 background book written by Simon Spurrier. It details all the main alien races of the Warhammer 40,000 universe, and some less well known ones. It features artwork including detailed dissections of the subjects investigated. It also includes some details of the Ordo Xenos. Xenology was published in 2006 and is now out of print. Inquisitor Maturin Ralei, a radical member of the Ordo Xenos, captured alien species to study them. After his death, the Inquisition's Conclave Conservati sends Inquisitor Brehm Sasham to investigate and destroy any potentially dangerous research and expose Relei as a heretic. After going to the planet Biegel and discovering Relei's research, Inquisitor Sasham seeks to destroy the research lab but is petitioned by Ralei's research assistant, Magos Darvus, to not destroy the place until the last specimens can be dissected and examined.
Jorvax	The Jorvax are a sentient Xenos species that worships the Chaos God Slaanesh. To them, his name is a jarring cacophony of symphonic disharmony, that is looped at mind shattering volume through the Jorvax's organic amplifiers, that grow like parasites upon their bodies.
Stryite	The Stryite are a race of small, spider-like sentient Xenos species, with white flesh and black blood. Each of their many limbs are tipped with a vicious, poisoned barb. The Stryite infested the jungles of Stryia V, and employed many-limbed war engines. They later fought against a Blood Angels invasion, to colonize their world. The species' barb-blades are currently being studied by the Imperial Forge World, Stygies VIII.
Rhino	The Rhino is a common armoured troop transport produced by the Imperium. Its use is entrusted to only the most loyal of soldiers: the Space Marines, Sisters of Battle, Adeptus Arbites and the Inquisition.[2b] The Rhino is also used by the Chaos Space Marines, who either took their Rhinos with them after the Horus Heresy, or have stolen them in the millennia since then. The Rhino's versatile design has allowed the development (mostly through the rediscovery of STC designs) of several variants, each fulfilling a different tactical role. Popular variants include the Razorback, Predator, Whirlwind and Immolator.[2b]
Megarachnid	The Megarachnids were a fearsome and violent Xenos race encountered by Imperium during the Great Crusade era. They resembled arthropods in various forms.[1a][1b] - so-called Clades[1d] In the distant past, the Megarachnids found a way to the interstellar travels and even infested eight systems until the Interex civilisation found them and after a terrible war Megarachids were ultimately defeated. Rather than exterminate their foes, the benevolent Interex exiled the Megarachnids to the planet Urisarach and denied from them all means of interstellar travel.[1f] During the Great Crusade, the 140th Expeditionary Fleet discovered Urisarach (dubbed "One-Forty Twenty"), and, ignoring the Interex's orbital warning beacons, descended to the surface to effect compliance in the name of the Imperium.[1c] Then all contact with the 140th ceased, save for a lone distress call from Blood Angels Captain Khitas Frome, which ended "This. World. Is. Murder".[1a]
Octus Enoch	Octus Enoch is an Ordo Malleus Psychic Inquisitor that is active in the Calixis Sector. Enoch was once an Adeptus Arbites Arbitrator, who later became an Acolyte of the Inquisitor Calantis. While serving the Inquisitor, however, Enoch underwent a mind cleaning, that caused him to lose his memory and control of his latent psychic abilities. In time, Enoch was able to learn of his past life and began training to use his psychic powers. Calantis allowed this, but always had Enoch tested to ensure he did not fall to Heresy. He never failed Calantis' tests, however, and the Inquisitor later allowed a Acolyte Psyker, to use their powers to undo Enoch's mind cleansing. The operation was ultimately a success and Enoch's full memory of his life were restored to him. He eventually became an Ordo Xenos Inquisitor, before later joining the Ordo Malleus and becoming a member of the Scholariate at Arms. Enoch holds the title “Prognost Pursuant”, and his primary mission is to hunt down prophesies relating to future Daemonic incursions. Once he has found a true prophecy foretelling an incursion, and has interpreted it, he dispatches a cell of Acolytes to ensure that it does not come about; whatever the cost in doing so. To this end, Enoch employs a huge household, with a mix of Adepts and more militant Acolytes. The Adepts are tasked with poring through thousands upon thousands of tomes of prophecy, prognostication, and sometimes pure gibberish, and the others work in the field according to their master’s instructions. The Inquisitor rarely takes to the field himself, although he has done so in the past, most notably when he bound the daemon Nahterus into a Daemonhost and imprisoned it within a shuttle orbiting a dead star. Instead, Enoch presides over his many Acolyte cells, dispatching them across the entire Calixis Sector to disrupt the dark prophecies identified by his Adepts. He is utterly ruthless, and his Acolytes have standing orders to assassinate anyone who might bring about a daemonic incursion, whether deliberately or innocently. Over the decades, he has become highly skilled in thwarting the machinations of fate. In one infamous case, his most skilled savant uncovered a coded prophecy predicting that the end of Fenksworld would be brought about by a Warp breach of unprecedented proportions. The prophecy stated that the doom of Fenksworld would be presaged by the agonized baying of the mighty Loxophants kept in the Imperial Commander's private zoo, but gave no other clues to its nature or cause other than the timing of the breach. With time running out, Enoch resorted to ordering that every loxophant on Fenksworld be slain. Despite the protestations of the beasts’ owners, they were put to death and the Warp breach averted.
Deka Aku	Deka Aku is an Inquisitor.
Al-Subaai	Al-Subaai is an Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos. He is the youngest member of the Calixis Sector's Tyrantine Cabal. A recently-promoted Inquisitor who previously served as an Interrogator for Inquisitor Van Vuygens, Al-Subaai searches for alien influence among the worlds of the Calixis Sector. He believes that everything in the galaxy is connected and that the various xenos races are part of a larger web of hostility. The Galaxy, he believes, is literally reacting to Human hegemony like the body reacts to a disease. To him, aliens and creatures of the Warp are symptoms of the galaxy's enmity towards mankind. He therefore advocates the destruction of all aliens, especially those who influence Humans. A Puritan, he viciously hunts down any connected to xenos cults or technology, immediately destroying all involved.
Dilantha Alwis	Diala Endenvarr is an Ordo Malleus Inquisitor of the Askellon Sector. The Inquisitor is known to have confronted and banished the same Daemon 6 times, while protecting the Sector. A fact Alwis taunted the Daemon with, when they fought for a 7th time.
Lilith Abfequarn	Lilith Abfequarn was a female Inquisitor of the Ordo Hereticus. Lilith was born the daughter of a governess of a planet that lay at the edge of an Aeldari raiding territory. Lilith's mother died in a raid, which resulted in her developing a hatred and later fascination with the Aeldari. As a psyker, she was singled out by the Black Ships.[3b] Abfequarn served in the retinue of Inquisitor Myzard during the 400's.M41. She had ash-blonde hair and was rated very highly by Inquisitor Gideon Ravenor, who believed she would be sent after him by Inquisitor Rorken when he went rogue in 403. Harlon Nayl, a member of Ravenor's team was struck by her beauty and continuously stared at her indiscreetly, as noted by Ravenor.
Warhammer 40,000 3rd Edition Rulebook	Warhammer 40,000 3rd Edition Rulebook is the 3rd core rule book for the Warhammer 40,000 game published in October 1998. It was released as a black and white softback book. This book also introduces a new logo for Warhammer 40,000 taking on a darker colour theme over 2nd Edition's brighter colour scheme. This logo was used largely unchanged (besides an update in the next edition to desaturate the green) up until the release of 9th Edition where it was replaced with a more modern interpretation. The book, sometimes referred to as the Big Black Book, contained rules that although similar to the first two editions, were greatly simplified, removing many of the more difficult ideas of the previous versions in an attempt to streamline the game. This was heavily criticized at the time by more veteran gamers, who had become used to the tables, charts and templates that had been employed previously, as it was seen as being too simplistic and had eliminated much of the fun for that audience. Nevertheless, the modesty of the newer rules opened the game out to a wider (and much younger) audience.
Alexio	Alexio is an Inquisitor who, along with Inquisitors Fortez and Credo, destroyed the Temple of the Star Child on Levilnor IV after discovering its members had become the unwitting pawns of the Chaos God Tzeentch.
Radical	Radicals are a political and philosophical faction of the Inquisition. Setting themselves apart from the more conservative Puritans, the pragmatic Radical Inquisitors follow the Imperial doctrines in spirit, believing that the ends justify the means, and find little value in adhering to convention too closely. They often try to fight fire with fire, using Chaos or xenos weaponry, employing Daemonhosts, or committing other acts that would be deemed heretical by their more conservative brethren. Their experimentation with these forces often leads to them being branded heretics, or succumbing to the very power they sought to control.
Thorian	The rewards more than outweigh the risks should we succeed. Imagine it! The Emperor reborn and walking amongst his people as a living god. Who can say such a thing is wrong — Inquisitor Crescere. From Inquisitorial Report TH/21/36: “The Incunabla Incident" The Thorians are a sub-faction of the Puritan faction of the Inquisition.[1a] The Thorian faction's core ideology, the resurrection of the Emperor, in fact dates back to the very end of the Horus Heresy, long before the Thorians' namesake Sebastian Thor lived. Two of the original founders of the Inquisition, Promeus and Moriana, looked into means by which the ruler of mankind might be resurrected. However after Moriana began to look to Dark Powers in her quest, Promeus and his followers banished the Inquisitor to the Eye of Terror. The disciples of Promeus, the Promeans, began a quest over many centuries to restore the Emperor to a mortal body.[1a]
Calixis Sector	The Calixis Sector is an Imperial sector in Segmentum Obscurus near the Halo Stars and the Eye of Terror.[1b] The Sector capital is the Hive World of Scintilla.[1c] Conquered by Lord Militant Angevin a thousand years ago, the Calixis Sector contains many heavily populated and important worlds, although it lies a great distance from the Imperium's heartland. Its first governor was Drusus, one of Angevin’s most capable generals, a man now revered as an Imperial Saint.[1e] To trailing, the Calixis Sector is bordered by the hazardous territories of the Fydae Great Cloud and to spinward by the Scarus Sector. Bordering to coreward, its nearest neighbour is the Ixaniad Sector. To rimward lay the contested and unregulated frontiers of the Koronus Expanse and the Halo Stars.[1c]
Ordo Hereticus	The Ordo Hereticus (known colloquially as Witch Hunters) is one of the three major orders of the Inquisition. Their specific role is protecting mankind from itself, by combating such internal threats as treason, mutation, heresy, and witches. They are aided militarily by the Adeptus Ministorum's Sisters of Battle. Because of its vast jurisdiction and mission, the Ordo Hereticus is the largest of all the Inquisition's Ordos.[2b] The Ordo Hereticus was founded much later than the Ordo Xenos and Ordo Malleus, created after the Age of Apostasy which occurred during the second century of the 36th millennium. The Apostasy and the many heresies that took root during the anarchy (most notably the Plague of Unbelief), had severely destabilized the Imperium in a way not seen since the Horus Heresy. The Ordo Hereticus was formed as a check on the Ecclesiarchy, ensuring that another man like Vandire could not gain the level of power and control he did. Although the Ecclesiarchy has its own internal regulatory bodies, it is still the role of the Inquisition to monitor all organizations of the Imperium, including the Ecclesiarchy.
Ibram Gaunt	Lord Militant General Ibram Gaunt was an Astra Militarum officer best known for his long-running command of the Tanith First and Only Imperial Guard regiment, also known as "Gaunt's Ghosts". A favoured subordinate of the Imperial Warmaster Slaydo, the once simply Commissar Gaunt was given the unusual distinction of regimental command by the Warmaster on his deathbed. Gaunt was to assume command of three Imperial Guard regiments drawn from the backwoods world of Tanith, but terrible tragedy during their Founding resulted in only enough men for a single regiment surviving. Gaunt would go on to turn these ragtag, ill-disciplined, under-equipped survivors into one of the most notable and successful regiments that served during the Sabbat Worlds Crusade, though it took a long time for their achievements to be noted and rewarded. Gaunt ultimately rose to the rank of First Lord Executor, serving as right-hand man and acknowledged successor to Warmaster Macaroth. Ibram Gaunt was born on Manzipor, the son of the second-in-command of the Jantine Patricians regiment, who had him tutored by Benthlay.[1a] After the death of his father at the hands of Orks, Gaunt was sent to the Schola Progenium on Ignatius Cardinal, where he first met Vaynom Blenner.[1b] After his graduation he saw action in many theatres as a Cadet-Commissar, attached to the Hyrkan Regiments and under the tutelage of Commissar Delane Oktar.[1c] While battling human separatists on Darendara, Gaunt learned from a captured enemy psyker that his "Uncle" General Aldo Dercius, who had sponsored his education at the Scholam, was responsible for his father's death, having abandoned his position in fear, leaving the elder Gaunt to be overwhelmed by the Orks.[1d][1e] Gaunt was promoted to full Commissar at the death-bed of his mentor Oktar, who had been poisoned by Orks on Gylatus Decimus.[1f] His first action was to condemn General Dercius for his cowardice and execute him with his chainsword, though Dercius, in his desperation to defend himself, gave Gaunt a near-fatal wound to the stomach with his own weapon. Unbeknownst to Gaunt, this act disinherited Dercius's son Draker, who would later seek revenge.[1d]
Aris	Aris is a famous Ordo Hereticus Inquisitor Lord.
Askellon Sector	The Askellon Sector is an Imperial sector in Segmentum Obscurus near the Halo Stars and the Eye of Terror.[1a] Askellon is an ancient region, pre-dating the founding of the Imperium itself, and its history is filled with secrets and lies that have stained every generation. As if to compound its woes, the sector is cursed with a seemingly unending warp storm known as the Pandaemonium that waxes and wanes across the millennia.[1b] With each passing century it grows ever more intense and dangerous, raging like a hungry beast that seeks to devour the entire sector. Within Askellon, it is the prophesied Time of Ending, close to the culmination of the 41st Millennium.[1c] The Askellon Sector is home to several Rogue Trader dynasties, including the houses of Anzaforr, Surena and Roth. During M41, the Anzaforr and Surena dynasties engaged in a bitter naval feud over salvage rights on several worlds newly reclaimed from abating warp storms; the conflict was ended only when sector command threatened to intervene, and imposed sanctions of penance on both sides of the war.[2b]
Khattar Massacre	The Khattarn Insurrection was a Chaos-instigated anti-Imperial rebellion that arose on the planet Khattar in late M41. Khattar was once a world pledged to the Ecclesiarchy, until the ruling priesthood turned from the Emperor to the worship of the Gods of Chaos, embracing Slaanesh. The priests gathered support, with Khattar's PDF and several Imperial Guard Regiments stationed in neighbouring systems joining their cause. Inquisitor Apollyon took command of the operation to suppress the Insurrection, instigating a Naval blockade of Khattar. Lacking the ground forces necessary to secure Khattar's surface, Apollyon called for aid from the Celestial Lions Chapter. Five companies deployed to the planet's surface under the command of Captain Saul and crushed the rebellion.
Adenius	Adenius is an Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos. She has spent the majority of her life combatting the Drukhari of the Kabal of the Emerald Thorn - in particular trying to dismantle the Kabal's smuggling network. Adenius has gained a reputation for being both mysterious and as sinister as the very xenos she fights.
Vils Andarion	Inquisitor Vils Andarion is one of several Ordo Xenos luminaries drawn to Watch Fortress Erioch since the Jericho Maw Warp Gate has opened. His primary interest is in the gate itself, but the dangers in the Well of Night have driven him to Erioch to pursue his investigations. Here he can at least study data gathered about the warp gate in its dormant state throughout the Age of Shadows. Andarion has a theory that the warp gate and several of the older xenos sites scattered around the Jericho Reach are somehow interconnected. If he is right, the opening of the warp gate portends some truly dire events at those sites in the future. The Inquisitor keeps a substantial retinue of adepts, savants and servitors at the Tower of Brass for this very purpose. Andarion has also made several expeditions to the planets Jove’s Descent and Karlack following in the footsteps of the missing Inquisitor Zaer Vincent. Andarion's interest in the local myths of a city beneath the sea brought him to Karlack prior to Vincent's disappearance and the two co-operated in the investigation for a time. He has resolved not to let the matter of Inquisitor Vincent's disappearance drop until Vincent, or more than likely his slayer, is found.
Arken	Arken is an Ordo Xenos Inquisitor who was beset by Cultists on the night-world Tenar Prime, until a Blood Ravens Scout assigned to its Sector came to his aid. Though Arken survived the encounter with the Cultists, the fate of the Blood Ravens Scout was never discovered. An Inquisitor named Arken was later killed by the Eyestinger Swarm Mutoid Vermin, though it is not known if they are the same person.
Agmar	"They have only one purpose and there is nothing they will not do to accomplish this, no matter how vile or loathsome it might be. These abominations mean to destroy everything proud and noble, everything we hold dear and have fought so long to achieve."- Inquisitor Agmar on Tyranids Agmar is a young but talented Inquisitor of the Ordo Hereticus. In 993.M41 he became key to the Imperial defence of Ichar IV from Hive Fleet Kraken. Initially battling Genestealer cults on Ichar IV's capital of Lomas, Agmar discovered during the course of the battle that the planet was suffering a Genestealer infestation of unparalleled size. In the utmost secrecy he sent a report to an Inquisitorial Conclave and awaited the arrival of Space Marines.
Cast a Hungry Shadow (Short Story)	Cast a Hungry Shadow is a short story by Peter Fehervari. On the Imperial world of Redemption, scant years after the destruction of the resident order of Adepta Sororitas, new powers are rising. The apparently benevolent cult of the Spiral Dawn tends to the sick and the infirm, even as they hide their own dark secrets from the Ecclesiarchy. Meanwhile, gangs following a brutal demagogue continue the work of the Ruinous Powers of Chaos. Now, their interests collide with the emergence of the Teller – a latent psyker hiding in the depths – and the two rival cults each strike out to claim her for themselves.
Angel of Silence	The Angel of Silence is a suit of Scout Armour belonging to the Blood Ravens Chapter. When Inquisitor Arken of the Ordo Xenos found himself beset by cultists at the night-planet Tenar Prime, his life was saved by a Blood Ravens scout assigned to the sector. The Angel of Silence was commissioned posthumously in honour of that unnamed scout whose final fate was never recorded and incorporates the finest camo cloak advanced targeting links and sound-dampening material available.
Farseer	Farseers are the most powerful of all Eldar psykers. They are most often known for using their vast psychic powers to see the possibilities of the future to be able to manipulate events to better ensure the survival of the Eldar. A Farseer is a former Warlock who has become lost on the Path of the Seer, much like the Exarchs who have become lost on the Path of the Warrior.[13b] Farseers are amongst the most powerful of Seers and every Craftworld has a handful of Farseers among their number. Much of their time is spent in a trance-like state where their spirits roam at will throughout the Wraithbone where they direct the psychic-energy flow throughout the entire Craftworld. As such, they are not normally in a waking state though their visionary skills allow them to direct their fellow Eldar in avoiding dangers that can fall upon the Craftworlds. This is by way of exploring potential future paths that lie ahead and determining which paths need to be altered. Their duties mean that Farseers normally do not fight the wars of the Eldar but in times of desperate need, they can be seen on the battlefield where they use their incomparable power to aid their race in combat. Eldar armies are sometimes accompanied by a single Farseer, which is due to the fact that more cannot be spared as they are tasked with guiding the future of their Craftworld. However, their powers are greater than Warlocks and are able to concentrate on casting Seer Runes to determine courses of action that would be most fortunate for their forces.
The Inquisition (Background Book)	The Inquisition: An Illustrated Guide to the Secretive Protectors of the Imperium is a background book that was produced by Black Library in 2007 and features an encyclopaedic look at the Inquisition. It includes many larger articles on famous members of the Inquisition and events in its history, as well as many small entries of less well known friends, enemies, and events. It is a 96 page softbound book containing colour images and illustrations throughout.
Aghastri	Aghastri is a male Inquisitor of the Ordo Sepulturum. He is a Thorian and is the best known investigator of the Zombie Plague of the Thirteenth Black Crusade.
Korbinian Alojs	Korbinian Alojs is a Radical Inquisitor of the Ordo Hereticus and is among the few Inquisitors that are stranded within the Gilead System, due to the Great Rift's creation. He warns that the honeyed words of Chaos are lies that will bring about a listener's downfall, though they do contain some truth. Alojs has made it known, that those that wish to hear these truths without risking corruption, should put their trust in him in order to be enlightened.
Victoria Aldrich	Victoria Aldrich is a Psyker Inquisitor of the Ordo Hereticus, who served as an Interrogator for Inquisitor Yusuph Trevar before she achieved her current rank. Trevar specifically chose Victoria, and took her under his wing, due to the gusto with which she approached the job of rooting out heretical and daemonic infestation. He considered a zealot like Victoria to be the perfect counterbalance to his methodical trickery and she learned much of her cunning and planning from him. She has now served as an Inquisitor for a century, but still retains her enthusiasm for her work and has the full support of her Ordo. This allows Victoria to regularly avail herself to its armouries, which is just as well, as she is an upfront Inquisitor who avoids the secretive, skulking tactics of her brethren. When facing powerful servants of the Chaos Gods, though, Victoria will take a more pragmatic approach, which she learned from Trevar, and will gather the information she needs to defeat her foes. While the Inquisitor spends most of her time destroying Cults and heretical plots on Imperial worlds, Victoria has fearlessly fought lesser Daemons on numerous occasions. Wielding her anointed plasma pistol and the Twice-Blessed Spear, the Inquisitor has defeated every Daemon she has fought - even ones many claim should have easily killed her. Whatever the reason is for her victories, Victoria has come to rely on this good fortune, and will hurl herself into conflicts which seem hopeless. She trusts in the Emperor to protect her during these battles, but Victoria will not hesitate to invoke the Malleus Remit, to conscript whatever forces or weapons she needs to achieve victory.
Hasarna	Hasarna is a crop-world of the Imperium, located in the coreward regions of the Angelus Subsector in the Scarus Sector. In the mid-300's.M41, a Khornate Chaos Cult known as the Hearthood was active on Hasarna. The cult, led by the notorious heretic Amel Sanx, was destroyed in an Inquisition raid, with Inquisitor Aedelorn leading a Kill-Team of Adepta Sororitas in the attack.
Monthax	Monthax is a planet in the Sabbat Worlds Cluster. During the Sabbat Worlds Crusade it was the centre of a conflict between the forces of Chaos and a number of Imperial Guard Regiments including the Tanith First and Only, the Royal Volpone 50th "Bluebloods" and the Roane Deepers. Caught in the middle was a small Eldar force led by Lord Eon Kull, attempting to seal a Webway Gate on the planet before it was captured by Chaos. Monthax has a humid climate and is covered by dense jungle vegetation. It has no human population but does contain a number of unique plant and animal species that have adapted to its ecosystem.
Alecto Amaros	Alecto Amaros is a renegade Istvaanian Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos operating in the Calixis Sector. Amaros is rumoured to have had a hand in the forced landing of the Troop Transport Vervilix on the forbidden planet Mara. Though it has never been proven she was involved in that disaster, a number of the Imperial Guard survivors, who were not executed by the Inquisition for potential taint, were quietly drawn into the service of several Inquisitors with suspected links to Amaros. She is also accused of manipulating a cabal of smugglers and bio-pirates into modifying and distributing gene-engineered aliens as pets and guard-forms on the planets of a local sector, which resulted in the spread of the Trygor Xeno Plague. The disease caused countless deaths and lead to the Euthanous Edict, which in turn led to the purging of a dozen worlds of all non-human life. All of which was Amaros's plan, to force the sector's authorities to combat the spread of potentially dangerous xeno-forms in the sector.
Credo (Inquisitor)	Credo is an Inquisitor who, along with Inquisitors Fortez and Alexio, destroyed the Temple of the Star Child on Levilnor IV after discovering its members had become the unwitting pawns of the Chaos God Tzeentch.
Absalom Angevin	Absalom Angevin was a legendary Inquisitor, who was the tutor to the Inquisitor Commodus Voke. Among his many deeds, is successfully leading the Imperium's forces against Pontius Glaw on Lamsarrote, where Angevin personally killed the Heretic.
Ichar IV	Ichar IV is a Hive World located in the Ultima Segmentum, to the galactic north of Ultramar. It is a vital industrial centre for the region, producing supplies for many armies. Two of the planet's major exports are ore and myco-proteins. At the beginning of the Second Tyrannic War, it was infested with Genestealers. A genestealer cult, operating under the name, "the Brotherhood," instigated a rebellion on the planet that caught the attention of Inquisitor Agmar. The Brotherhood had control of the planet by the time Agmar arrived in the system. The inquisitor petitioned the Ultramarines to help put down the rebellion. Marneus Calgar, Chapter Master of the Ultramarines, arrived 39 days later aboard the Battle Barge, Octavius. Eventually, with the combined support of the Ultramarines, PDF forces and the Imperial Guard, the inquisition successfully destroyed the invasion and cleansed the planet of all Genestealers. One of the Imperial Guard units involved was the 13th Penal Legion, a.k.a. "The Last Chancers." After some time massive amounts of Tyranids landed on the Ichar IV including not only mundane Gaunts, Warriors, and Carnifex's but also larger creatures like the Tyrannofex and Hierophant Bio-Titans. The Imperial defenses were reinforced again by Marneus Calgar, who using tactics he had developed in the First Tyrannic War, rallied the defenders of planet and after a ferocious struggle the Tyranids were cast from the world.
13th Black Crusade	Thirteen times shall the Traitor King go forth. In the End Times the iron fortress shall be cast down. Its walls breached and its Gate forced open. Those that dwell beyond shall spill through it. The air shall burn and the ground shall melt, The Daemon shall lie down with the machine, Brother shall slay brother with fire and sword. And the sky-wound shall pour its malice forth. The Eye shall stare unblinking at its prize, and the Traitor King shall cross the bridge of stars. He shall return to finish the Warmonger's red work, Upon holy soil shall the fate of man be decided. The 13th Black Crusade of Abaddon the Despoiler began in 999.M41, and resulted in the largest mobilisation of both Imperial and Chaotic forces seen since the Horus Heresy. Abaddon's strategy was based around the concept of The Crimson Path: by summoning enough Daemons to the surface of Cadia, he intended to overload the Pylons holding back the tides of the Warp on the planet. If he had succeeded, the Eye of Terror would have enveloped Cadia and transformed it into a hellish Daemon World, after which Abaddon would jump from planet to planet from the Segmentum Obscurus, expanding the Warp rift until Terra itself was swallowed up into the Eye.[13a]
Levilnor IV	Levilnor IV is an Imperium world that was invaded by Orks; the Cadian 31st Armoured Regiment arrived to its defense. Later in 997.M41, the Inquisitors Fortez, Alexio and Credo arrived on the world and destroyed the Cultist Temple of the Star Child. This was after they discovered the Temple's members had become the unwitting pawns of the Chaos God Tzeentch.
Ansgar	Lord Ansgar is a Thorian Inquisitor of the Ordo Hereticus. He commanded the forces prosecuting the Palatine Crusade and was the one to declare Celestine a Living Saint.
Istvaanian	"Would you have Mankind grow old and withered, running to fat on the fruit of remembered glory whilst its enemies tear at its frail extremities? I think not. With each trial, we become stronger. My brethren and I will provide." Istvaanism is a Radical ideological faction of the Inquisition. To adherents of this ideology, conflict is desirable to further progress through strife. It holds that mankind has made its greatest achievements after periods of conflict, such as the Horus Heresy, or Age of Apostasy. It is the place of the Istvaanians to strengthen mankind through adversity, and so follow a 'survival of the fittest' doctrine. The philosophy is named after the Isstvan III virus-bombings that initiated the Horus Heresy. A secretive group of Istvaanians took on the name Elucidium to hide the true nature of the activities, even from fellow inquisitors.
Forces of the Imperial Inquisition Collectors' Guide	Forces of the Imperial Inquisition Collectors' Guide is one of Collectors' Guides series of works that were produced by Games Workshop and served as catalogs, showcases of painted armies, and Golden Demon entries. It is currently out of print.
Appoloyon	Appoloyon was an Ordo Malleus Inquisitor who fought beside the Grey Knights in the Godjera Incursion.
Ahmazzi	Ahmazzi is an Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus. The sole Daemonhunter in the Tyrantine Cabal of the Calixis Sector, he is a grizzled veteran close to 300 years old. His career has taken him from Titan to the edges of the Imperium itself, and in the end has turned him into a pessimistic and cynical old man. He believes that the human race is currently driving itself towards inevitable extinction, which has led him to dabble with Radicalism. This in turn has seen him declared Excommunicate Traitoris by Puritan colleagues but none in the cabal save Anton Zerbe knows this. Nonetheless he has no friends on the cabal and does not particularly care what others think of him. It is possible to gain his respect, but only if one displays courage and skill against a Daemonic foe.
Agustius	Inquisitor Lord Agustius was a Thorian Puritan, of the Ordo Xenos and long time friend of Inquisitor Lord Brutius Parthon. He was so adverse to all types of technology that he had even refused to accept bionic implants in his crippled legs, preferring instead to trundle about in his wheelchair. He was normally in charge of the Deathwatch Kill Team led by Captain Quirion Octavius.[Needs Citation] Agustius had been traveling to the Segmentum Obscurus frontier, to take charge of the forces battling Tyranid incursions, when he learned the Herodian warp gate had been closed by Parthon. He had his gunship redirected to rendezvous with Parthon's Inquisition battleship, the Veiled Salvation. He was surprised to learn Parthon had co-opted his Deathwatch Kill Team and sent them to Herodian IV, but understood once Parthon explained the mission they were to undergo against the Tyranids invading the planet.[1a] As he watched, the Tyranids battle the Imperial Navy task force above the planet Herodian IV, he was not satisfied with Parthon's plan and kept wondering why his friend was wasting the Imperial force's lives, instead of ordering an Exterminatus. He received his answer when his retinue, of Interrogator Lexopher and Death Cult Assassin Slyrian, found files on board the Veiled Salvation that showed Parthon had built a hidden weapons laboratory on the planet below. Agustius left Parthon's ship, in order to decide on a course of action[1b]. He decided to move against his friend and accuse him of heresy, for wasting Imperial lives in battle with the Tyranids, just so Parthon could save his weapons laboratory.[1c]
Ordo Sepulturum	The Ordo Sepulturum are one of the many Ordos Minoris of the Imperial Inquisition. The Ordo Sepulturum is one of the smallest and more specialized within the Inquisition. It operates around the Eye of Terror and is dedicated to plagues that threaten the Imperium, such as the Zombie Plague and the Obliterator Virus. Even though occurrences of Plague Zombies have been recorded across the Imperium for millennia, the Plague Fleets of the Chaos Champion Typhus have increased the threat level posed by such a foe to the level where they are considered a serious danger to the Imperium. To herald Abaddon's 13th Black Crusade, incidents involving the Zombie Plague increased around the Cadian system dramatically. This brought the attention of the Inquisition with numerous Thorian agents in communication with each other. The rising number of such Inquisitors that were investigating the plague resulted in the formation of the Ordo Sepulturum.
Koronus Expanse	The Koronus Expanse, also known as the Koronus Sector, is the name given by Imperial authorities to a dangerous, unexplored region of the Halo Stars beyond the Calixis Sector.[1a] The Expanse is accessed via the Koronus Passage, a treacherous but navigable route through the great warp storms that bar the passage to the Halo Stars beyond the way station of Port Wander.[Needs Citation] As is true of the Calixis Sector itself, the Expanse was untouched by the God-Emperor's Crusade many millennia ago and so it is a realm of fearsome xenos, treasures beyond imagining, heathen worlds of men, and the echoes of the ancient doom.[1a]
Absolvus	Absolvus was a male Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos. He was one of the first to visit Obsidian Station after it had suffered a Dark Eldar attack, in which five thousand soldiers had been killed and every skull removed, but their bodies remained.
Amel Sanx	Amel Sanx was the leader of the Khorne Hearthood Chaos Cult[1a], when it was destroyed by the Imperium. A few members of the Cult survived its downfall, but it is not known if Sanx was among them.[1b]
Aedelorn	Aedelorn was an Inquisitor active in the mid-300's.M41. He was responsible for leading the Inquisition's efforts in eradicating a Khornate Chaos Cult called the Hearthood, that was active on the planet Hasarna. Aedelorn led a Kill-Team of Adepta Sororitas to Hasarna's northern continent and eradicated the cult. They were able to kill the cult's leader, Amel Sanx, and most of its members, although at least one was able to escape alive.
Lowry	Lowry is a female Inquisitor of the Ordo Hereticus.[1a] In 989.M40 she received information from Ulthwe emissaries that, one hundred years later, helped to solve the mystery of the Levicus Anomaly.[1b] In 195.998.M41, she reported encountering three Chaos Space Marines of the Terror Lords while investigating seditious activity on the Hive World of Fulcrum. They slew the majority of a PDF company before they were overwhelmed and killed. Lowry herself was severely wounded during the battle.[1a]
Kobras Aquairre	Kobras Aquairre was a merciless and terrifying Rogue Trader and Inquisitor Lord. These two positions gave Aquairre extraordinary power within the Imperium and he developed a well-deserved reputation as a butcher of worlds.[1a] In 570.M40, he led a composite fleet of Rogue Trader and Imperial Navy elements to victory against a Xeno Corsair fleet led by Eldar renegades and the Butcher Archon. This ended their raids of The Periphery called The White Sorrows. In 101.M41 his fleet entered the depths of the Koronus Expanse after being tasked with rooting out Xenos and those who fled the Emperor's judgment there. Aquairre would never return to the Imperium again, but he couriered reports of his actions back to Port Wander in the Calixis Sector. These reports form the basis of much of what is known by the Imperium about the Koronus Expanse to this day. However, it is believed that Aquairre reported far less than what he found to his masters. Even now, dead and ravaged worlds marked by his banner are still being rediscovered within the Koronus Expanse.[1a]
White Dwarf 234 (UK)	White Dwarf 233 White Dwarf 62 White Dwarf 50 White Dwarf 42 White Dwarf 4 White Dwarf 234 (July 1999) Warhammer 40,000:
Lysette Astromar	Lysette Astromar is an Ordo Xenos Inquisitor[1b] who has tracked down[1a] a brood of Genestealers[1b] to an Imperial world. After meeting with the world's Planetary Governor, Astromar was able to convince him of both the immense threat the Genestealers posed and that she was the only hope his world now had to destroy them.[1a] However, the Tyranid brood, which the world's PDF have named the Writhing Shadow, has proven to be the most lethally ferocious Genestealers Astromar has ever encountered. She now tells the Imperial forces under her command that the battle with the Genestealers will be the fight of their lives.[1b]
Arcturos	Arcturos is an senior Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos, active in the Calixis Sector. A member of the Xenos Hybris faction, he is renowned as an Eldar specialist who has dedicated his whole life to studying them and their influence on the whole Segmentum Obscurus. Consequently, he is a fanatical user of divination techniques he learned from them.
Xeno Hybris	The Xenos Hybris is a faction within the Inquisition, consisting of like-minded Radical Inquisitors in the Calixian Conclave who believe that Mankind must learn from both the achievements as well as the mistakes of Xenos races. The Hybris reckon that only by mutual understanding and cooperation with aliens will Humanity survive in the galaxy. This group is strictly confined to the Calixis Sector and attract many who find the allure of greater knowledge from aliens to be a promising field. As such, they feel that others tend to be ignorant of the potential gains offered by aliens and that intolerance of xenos is against their own beliefs. There are only a few Inquisitors that follow the teachings of the Xenos Hybris and dedicate their lives to the pursuit of such a field of mutual cooperation. However, some believe that before the faction's end, they may create a great catastrophe for the Imperium. Agents of the Xenos Hybris are often searching amongst the ruins of long dead alien worlds and often form alliances with xenophile Hereteks in order to create melding of Human/Xeno technology. Their complete belief in their objective means that the Xenos Hybris often kill any who stand in their way. As such, whilst they are often scholarly individuals, agents of the Xenos Hybris are equally fanatical in their goals.
Commodus Voke	This article contains text passages or images with citation issues. The concerned content is marked with "Citation issue" tags. Please help to improve this article by fixing those issues as described in the corresponding Help article. Do also note that it is absolutely forbidden to add new information or content to these marked passages as long as the pre-existing citation issues have not been completely resolved. Commodus Voke was a venerated Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus. He was a Thorian with a leaning towards Monodominant except for his exceptional psychic powers.[1a] He lived to a very old age due to being extremely difficult to kill, although he was arrogant and sometimes difficult to get along with.[Help] Voke served under the esteemed Inquisitor Absalom Angevin during his novitiate period, during which time he participated in Angevin's many purges of Chaos cults and the burning of many heretics, one of the more notable being Pontius Glaw.[1a]
Aethia	Aethia is an Inquisitor Lady, of the Ordo Xenos, who took part in the Tyrama Secundus Campaign. She used her powers as an Inquisitor to induct the entire Imperial Navy 2987th Tactical Assault Wing, comprised of Valkyries, into her household to provide transport for her warriors; during the Imperium's battle with aquatic Xenos on the Ocean World Tyrama Secundus. The 2987th remains in the Inquisitor Lady's service to this day long after the aquatic aliens were destroyed.
Inquisitorial Representative	The Inquisitorial Representative is a title held by one of the High Lords of Terra, who sits on the Senatorum Imperialis on behalf of the Inquisition. Nominated from amongst the Inquisitor Lords of the sectors that surround holy Terra, these individuals are often referred to as the Inquisitor Lord Terran. Sometimes, it is not unusual for several Inquisitor Lords to share the duties of the Inquisitorial Representative at once. Furthermore, whilst their attendance is always appreciated, the position in the chambers of the Senatorum Imperialis is often left vacant with their vote being conferred by missive, which highlights the demands of the Inquisition on its agents. Those that hold the title of Inquisitorial Representative may only fulfil their duty once in their life, or they can attend the Senatorum for many years. The requirements of the Inquisition's service, however, may lead to them being called away from Terra in order to attend a High Conclave, though others have been known to tire of the politics as well as bureaucracy of the Senatorum which leads to them relinquishing their post in order to return to more active duties in the galaxy. In addition, in order to avoid a Representative from engaging in their own political actions, a term of office for the Inquisitor Lord Terran is fixed for a maximum of five years, after which they must stand down. When choosing an Inquisitor for this post, it is rare for the Inquisitor Lords to not be able to agree on the candidate. This is because the office carries ultimately very little honour, other than that of being a messenger of the Inquisition who communicates their words rather than their Representative's own. Despite this being the case, the Inquisitorial Representative also holds a great deal of responsibility. This is because whilst the Inquisition holds absolute authority, this is only the case through the cooperation of the other High Lords of Terra, which is essential in the maintenance of the Inquisition's power. If, for example, the Representative suffers from the wrath of the Fabricator-General of Mars then the starships and weapons of the Inquisition may suffer risk. Alternatively, if the Inquisition feels that an organisation is shirking from its duty then they can apply the appropriate pressure to the relevant High Lord, thus turning an organisational issue into one of personal confidence. Such actions provide a Representative with an unparalleled level of leverage as they have not attained their position by personal ambition or desire which means they risk nothing by these dealings with the other High Lords. However, the High Lords themselves are often well aware that their subordinates view their positions with envy and ambition which often means that they must take active steps to protect their power. Thus, the merest hint of the Inquisition's displeasure can serve as a catalyst for the respective High Lord being removed from their office and represented by another member from their ranks. Such actions are typically devastating for those High Lords whose positions are not permanent such as the Speaker for the Chartist Captains or the Lord Commander of Segmentum Solar who are the most vulnerable to the manipulations of the Inquisitorial Representative.
Ander	Ander is an Ordo Hereticus Inquisitor. In M42, he sent one of his Acolyte to Siscia, in search of a powerful object. The Acolyte also was ordered to discover who led a Chaos Cult on the world and he would sent encrypted letters to Ander, detailing his progress. Sometime after the Acolyte was sent, however, the Cult began an uprising on the Imperial world. Ander then lost contact with his Acolyte and the Imperium sent a fleet to end the rebellion, do to Siscia's importance. The Order of Our Martyred Lady Battleship Fiery Heart, was sent as a vanguard to the world and Ander met with its commander, Canoness Preceptor Oris. From her, the Inquisitor learned that the invasion of Siscia would begin, once the rest of the fleet arrived. After hearing this, Ander asked for Oris' to send a force of Adepta Sororitas in finding his Acolyte, before the invasion began. Ander required that due to its importance, that the Canoness Preceptor secretly send an efficient force for the mission. He also asked that a Sister Dialogus accompany the force and that Oris use her resources to decipher the encrypted letters, the Acolyte had sent him. Oris would do so and sent a force of 8 Sororitas to Siscia, who were led by Canoness Veridyan. When he learned of this, Ander questioned why Oris would send such a small force, given the importance of their mission. She replied that given the Inquisitor's requirements, the Sororitas she had sent would be enough to successfully find the Acolyte. However, Ander was unaware that Oris now harbored hidden doubts, since they began gathering details from Siscia. The little information they had gathered described a deteriorating situation, which left the Canoness unsure about Veridyan's chance of succeeding.
Arzen	The name or term "Arzen" may refer to:
Divination	Divination is a Psychic Discipline, its practitioners of Divination are known as Diviners or fortune tellers. Diviners are Psykers who seek to discern the hidden past of the galaxy and know the course of events yet to come.

Acherus	Lord Acherus was a Chaos Knight of House Lucaris, who piloted a Knight Tyrant and was among its forces[1a] that took part in the War of Beasts on Vigilus.[1b] He and the Knight Despoiler Zar Obedon[1a], later led their Knights to support a Black Legion strike force sent to claim the world's Stygian Spires from the Imperium[1b]. This led the strike force to fight against the Delverghouls of the Cult of the Four-Armed Emperor, as well as the Death Guard and Raven Guard[1c]. In the massive battle that followed, Acherus' mind was struck by the psychic powers of the Raven Guard Vanguard Librarian Moradus. This allowed the rest of the Raven Guard to destroy his Hive Tyrant[1d] and most of House Lucaris' Knights would soon die as well. Ultimately, though, the Delverghouls claimed the Spires.[1e]
Arnuldus	Arnuldus was an Inquisitor who was disposed of by Cypher. Taking up his identity, Cypher took command of the defenses of the Hive World of Septius VII and brought the planet to ruin.

Cypher	"I know not whether Cypher is the greatest threat, or the greatest hope for the Imperium. I only pray we can stop him before we find out." Cypher is a mysterious figure associated with the Dark Angels. Taking a pre-heresy title of office in The Order, his role was that of keeper of secrets and traditions. The current Cypher is said to be one of The Fallen. It is not even possible to deduce whether Cypher is for or against the Imperium, an ally or enemy to those who betrayed the Dark Angels. Cypher does not always work alone, at times seeming to ally or associate himself with others. His presence upon a planet draws dangerous elements to him from across the galaxy. Whether this is through his bidding is unclear, but it is too recurrent to be mere happenstance. Ultimately, no matter if he is surrounded by others: Cypher is a loner, a rogue agent whose true intentions are unknown to those he has served alongside. Cypher’s targets and destinations are as inscrutable as everything else about him. Among his confirmed kills have been planetary governors, Chaos Lords, Space Marine Chapter Masters, sorcerous covens, cult leaders and high ranking Inquisitors. He has fought alongside both Chaos Terminators and Daemon Princes as well as Imperial Guardsmen and Space Marines. The one thing they all have in common is that they serve the purpose in his mysterious grand plan.
Apollyon (Inquisitor)	"He who allows the alien to live shares its crime of existence."- Inquisitor Apollyon[1a] Apollyon was an Inquisitor. When the planet Khattar fell to heresy and tried to secede from the Imperium, Apollyon found out about this treachery and initiated a campaign to break the rebellion. The Inquisitor successfully blockaded Khattar's orbit with an Imperial Navy fleet but lacked the ground forces necessary to take the planet's surface. He called upon the Celestial Lions for aid, who mobilised five companies led by Captain Saul.

Kraken	Kraken was the second major Tyranid Hive Fleet to invade the galaxy. It was responsible for the Second Tyrannic War (or Second Tyranid War), occurring in 992.M41. The invasion began 250 years after the last Tyrannic War and the destruction of the hive fleet Behemoth. An armed presence had been maintained in the galactic southeast, which members of Earth's Administratum began to question the need for, arguing that Behemoth had been the sum total of the Tyranid race. When worlds along the eastern fringe began to erupt in rebellion, terrorism, riots and sabotage, the same adepts claimed the people were dissatisfied with living amid an armed camp. Among the first worlds known to be consumed by Kraken were Sotha, Miral, Graia and Radnar. The Inquisition became suspicious of the adepts' dissent and their downplaying of the situation, and began an investigation, which established that all of the dissenting adepts had either come from the southeastern region or had travelled there at some time. This was the only link between the members that could be found, and some had never even met each other. Inquisitors were also deployed from Talasa Prime to investigate the planets of the Ultima Segmentum who were displaying their anger. Purges were made within the Imperium, especially on Terra, focused on suspected traitors, who had had contact with the Eastern Fringe. Tens of thousands of suspected traitors were sent to prison colonies.[Needs Citation]
Stalia von Dressen	Stalia von Dressen was an Inquisitor who in M35 led resistance against Horusian factions within the Inquisition. Originally accepted into the Inquisition by Inquisitor Lord Phoran, she was tutored by her mentor in the beliefs of Promeus and the dire threat represented by the Horusians. Abandoning her normal Inquisitorial duties, von Dressen embarked upon a lifetime of traveling and making as many connections with the most revered Inquisitors as possible. Eventually, she became highly respected in the Inquisition to the point of being allowed to conduct research on Promean resurrectionist ideology with Lord Inquisitor Ardlan Baigdan on Terra. Eventually, the two spent twenty years in Terra's archives, and upon finding the Book of Promeus, saw the truth behind the original schism between Promeus and Moriana and came to the conclusion that resurrection was a fool's errand. Now one hundred and twenty years old, she led a vicious purge of resurrectionists within the Inquisition that saw pro-resurrection sentiment all but eliminated until the rise of Sebastian Thor after the Age of Apostasy.
Angmar	Angmar is an Inquisitor who fought the Tyranids on Ichar IV, during the Second Tyrannic War. While the battle raged, the Inquisitor encountered the Kroot Khibala Yusra and his Murabla Kindred, who fought the Tyranids in revenge for a failed invasion of their Homeworld Pech. After seeing them in battle, Angmar granted the Kroot sanction and inducted them into his retinue. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Eistus Gracker	Eistus Gracker is a Calixis Sector Inquisitor, who claims the biggest obstacle his fellow Calixian Conclave Inquisitors face, is themselves. They belong to so many differing factions and groups, that the Conclave has become a sea of discord which has left their foes cackling with glee.
Interrogator	An Interrogator is an Acolyte of the Inquisition, acting as their Inquisitor's apprentice. Few Acolytes are granted this privilege, which is often only given after many decades of service. Some serve independently from their master in groupings with other Acolytes, while some others accompany their master in his Inquisitorial duties. At some point, his or her master may recommend to the Ordos of the Inquisition to advance the Acolyte to full Inquisitorial rank. After this, the Interrogator is a full Inquisitor and begins his own agenda and operations. Although the former Interrogator is no longer bound to his old master, the two will have formed a bond and may work together and help one another in the future. Some apprentice Inquisitors start at the rank of Explicator, where they learn how to extract information using torture under the direction of their mentor Inquisitor. Explicators then move up as more experience is gained in the ways of the Inquisition to the rank of Interrogator.
Mordecai Toth	Mordecai Toth was an Inquisitor dispatched to Tartarus to ensure that the forces of Chaos were found and purged. Arriving in the Blood Ravens' midst while they were combating an Ork invasion, Toth warned their commander, Gabriel Angelos, about a coming warp storm and urged the Space Marines to evacuate the planet and let the storm claim the Orks. However, it was later revealed that Toth had been present on the planet since before the ork invasion, and that his primary mission was to recover the Maledictum, a powerful Chaos artifact.
Ortis Atenbach	Ortis Atenbach is an Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos. Inquisitor Atenbach once arrested Planetary Governor Ariani Dolos as she tried to flee the sector, suspected of the crimes of conspiring with xenos and importing contraband flora.
Adepta Sororitas	The Adepta Sororitas (also known as "the Sisterhood" or "Daughters of the Emperor") are an all-female subdivision of the religious organisation known as the Ecclesiarchy or Ministorum. The Sisterhood's Orders Militant serve as the Ecclesiarchy's fighting arm, mercilessly rooting out corruption and heresy within humanity and every organisation of the Adeptus Terra. The terms "Adepta Sororitas" and "Sisters of Battle" are commonly assumed to mean the same thing, but the latter title technically refers only to the Orders Militant - the military arm of the organisation which is the largest and the best-known part of the Sororitas. The Sisterhood serves as the Ministorum's only official military forces because the Decree Passive rules that the Ecclesiarchy cannot maintain any "men under arms". This was supposed to limit the power of the Ecclesiarchy. However, the Ministorum were able to circumvent this decree by using the all-female force of the Sisterhood.[Needs Citation] There is naturally some overlap between the duties of the Sisterhood and the Inquisition; for this reason, although the Inquisition and the Sisterhood remain entirely separate organisations, the Orders Militant of the Sisterhood are the go-to favoured option when an Ordo Hereticus Inquisitor needs soldiers.
Ragnar Blackmane	"We may be few, and our enemies many. Yet so long as there remains one of us still fighting, one who still rages in the name of justice and truth, then by the Allfather, the galaxy shall yet know hope."[1e] Ragnar Blackmane, also known as the Black Wolf, is the youngest Wolf Lord in the history of the Space Wolves, commanding the Blackmanes Great Company. Ragnar was born Ragnar Thunderfist on Fenris, a barbarian of the Thunderfists tribe. When he was still a teenager, his village was attacked by a rival tribe, the Grimskulls, who slaughtered his family and most of his tribe. Despite his youth, Ragnar showed extraordinary fighting talent, using berserker-like rage to slay many of the invaders. He finally fell in combat with the Grimskull youth who had killed his father, Strybjorn, though Ragnar dealt him a mortal wound in kind. Because of their equal ferocity and fighting skill, both youths were selected by the Wolf Priest Ranek to join the ranks of the Space Marines, and their lives were saved by the medicine of the Astartes.[12a]
Dethrec Balthagar	Dethrec Balthagar was a Puritan Ordo Xenos Inquisitor, who led a purge on the world Jauseth Septima with his Deathwatch allies, after learning the world was infested with a Genestealer Cult. Using psychic means, the Inquisitor and Death Watch exhaustively rooted out every last trace of the Cult and only left after declaring it from Xenos taint. However, the Inquisitor did not know that one of the Cult's fourth generation hybrids had left Jauseth Septima three weeks earlier aboard a cryopod shuttle, and later returned to reinfect the world. Within three years of Inquisitor Balthagar's death in service to the Imperium, Jauseth Septima was overrun by the Cult once more.
Pyropurge	The Pyropurge was a battle waged by the Imperium in M40. Using psychic means, the puritan Inquisitor Dethrec Balthagar and his Deathwatch allies rooted out every last trace of Genestealer infection on the planet Jauseth Septima. However, a fourth generation cultist with the germ-seed of the alien left the infected world three weeks earlier aboard a cryopod shuttle, and he later returned to his home planet. Within three years of Inquisitor Balthagar’s death in service, Jauseth Septima was overrun once more.
Sanctus Entente	The Sanctus Entente is an Inquisition Cabal, that is among the Ordos' forces combating Abaddon the Despoiler's efforts to collapse the Sanctus Wall. It is composed of the Ordo Militarum Inquisitors Derelei Melcho, Okal Nusa and Atuwe Kikiya, along with the Ordo Hereticus Inquisitor known only as Bataivah.
Balphus Bail	Balphus Bail is a Radical Ordo Xenos Inquisitor who installed cannibalised Xenotech into his ship, the Kastarsi, allowing him to safely navigate the Warp Storms of the Dark Imperium. When Tanatha's Fall was invaded by the Tau Empire, Bail used his ship to deliver a Deathwatch Kill-Team to aid in the Imperium world's defense. However, during the battle, disaster struck when the Kastarsi was boarded by the Tau and in order to prevent its technology from falling into the Xenos' hands, the Kill-Team destroyed the Inquisitor's ship. It's not known, however, if Bail escaped from the Kastarsi before the ship was destroyed.
High Lords of Terra	The Senatorum Imperialis (officially the Lords Temporal, Martial and Ecclesiarchical of the Most Divine and Righteous Imperium of Mankind) collectively form the Council of the High Lords of Terra. The Senatorum is an Imperial governing body led by twelve leaders of the most powerful organisations of the Imperium. This body rules the Imperium in the Emperor's name. The Senatorum itself is composed of tens of thousands of Imperial dignitaries, nobleman, lords, and other officials, but these rarely meet and instead the "High Twelve" conduct the vast majority of affairs. The task of the High Lords is to interpret and enact the will of the Emperor. Accordingly, the position of High Lord was the most powerful in the Imperium until the reemergence of Roboute Guilliman, who declared himself Imperial Regent, or the Emperor's Living Voice.[Conflicting Sources] Even subsequent to his return, the High Lords retain their position and task of ruling the Imperium in the Emperor's name. Determining who will hold the position of High Lord has resulted in millennia of political intrigue between the various bureaucracies seeking to increase their power. However, some organisations are so powerful, so fundamentally important to the Imperium, that their position on the Council is considered sacrosanct. For this reason the following nine offices are almost always represented as High Lords:
Ragan Balberith	Ragan Balberith was the Chief Inquisitor of Sigmatus, a world near the Eye of Terror, cut off from the rest of the Imperium.[1a] As the Chief Inquisitor, Blaberith was in charge of the inquisitorial forces operating on Sigmatus. Balberith’s Inquisition was in truth only an echo of the real Imperial Inquisition.[1a] The world had been isolated from the rest of the Imperium for two hundred years.[1b] Despite the worlds isolation and the planetary governor Orloc Melcarth’s more opportunistic goals to rule the world independent off the rest of the Imperium, Balberith remained loyal to the Imperium and hoped to re-establish contact with it one day.[1a] Ragan Balberith suffered from mild acrophobia.[1a]
Armageddon (Anthology)	Armageddon is an anthology in the Space Marine Battles Series, collecting Aaron Dembski-Bowden's novel Helsreach and the novella Blood and Fire. Black Templars Chaplain Grimaldus leads the defence of Hive Helsreach, a city in the path of a massive greenskin force on the war-wracked world of Armageddon. Battle rages and the Black Templars win several vital battles, but as the ork numbers grow and the Imperial defenders dwindle, Grimaldus and his loyal Sword Brethren are forced into a desperate last stand that will test the Chaplain’s resolve and leadership to their limits. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Gilead System	The Gilead System is a System of Imperial space on the inner border of the Gothic Sector that contains many different Human-inhabited worlds and was conquered by the Imperium in M34, while in the midst of a protracted Crusade. Due to the creation of the Great Rift, the Gilead System is now located within the Dark Imperium. The giant Warp Storm has also caused the Absolvers Chapter to become trapped within the System and they are now fighting to protect it. Due to the numerous threats facing Gilead, however, the Chapter is spread thin and they have increased their recruitment of Aspirants. The citizens of Gilead's Heartworlds, though, whisper of the righteous wrath of the Absolvers, as the Chapter is relentless and draconian in their fight against Heresy. Though they have had great success in defeating Daemons, the collateral damage in doing so has been significant. The Gilead System was thought to have been initially discovered and colonised during the Great Crusade, designated by crusaders as SKN-71-L-009, though it was quickly forgotten as a result of the Horus Heresy and its insignificant location in the galaxy.[4a] Imperial records show that it was rediscovered in the first century of M31 by the Mechanicum Explorator Fleet Tsuruoka, who designated the system NNE.59021, colonised Avachrus, and noted non-Imperial humans living on Ostia and Primus. The Mechanicum explorers discovered archaeotech and xenos ruins on the worlds, both of which they covered up, all the while expanding Imperial colonisation efforts. However, the natives of Ostia and Primus initially resisted assimilation.[4b]
Khattar	Khattar was a Cardinal World of the Imperium that fell to Chaos. Khattar was a world pledged to the Ecclesiarchy. However, its priesthood turned instead to the worship of the Gods of Chaos, pledging themselves to Slaanesh.. They convinced a populace weary of their prayers to the Emperor going unanswered to rise up in revolt. Their rebellion was far-reaching, with the Kattar PDF and multiple Imperial Guard Regiments stationed across nearby systems pledging their support for the now-heretical priests. Inquisitor Apollyon set out to contain the planet's heresy, initiating a naval blockade of Khattar. However, he lacked the forces to take to the planet's surface and expunge the rebellion directly. He eventually called for aid from the Celestial Lions Chapter. Five companies of Space Marines led by Captain Saul deployed to the surface of Khattar.
Barrero (Inquisitor)	Barrero is a Heretical Inquisitor, who has turned upon the Imperium. A Bolter that was once owned by Barrero is now in the possession of the Blood Ravens Chapter. Though it still resonates with the Inquisitor's madness.
Sigmatus	Sigmatus is an Imperium world that lies in the Segmentum Obscurus.[1b] Sigmatus is a Feudal World[1a] in the Segmentum Obscurus, located on the fringes of The Eye of Terror. It has three main continents and is made up of five principal nations. The worlds main religion was a form of worship of Tzeentch until a expeditionary force from The Imperium was stranded on the planet. Centuries later the descendants of the Imperials are in the midst of a global civil war where the last of the native nations is in the process of being conquered and the resisting natives are preparing to summon the demon Sathorael as a last gambit to win the conflict. [1b]
Fortez	Fortez is an Inquisitor who, along with Inquisitors Alexio and Credo, destroyed the Temple of the Star Child on Levilnor IV after discovering its members had become the unwitting pawns of the Chaos God Tzeentch.
Thanst Rendars-Mao	Thanst Rendars-Mao is an Ordo Malleus Inquisitor of the Astravigila Delegation. He thinks that, though Vigilus was once a mighty fortress against the enemies of the Imperium, the aftermath of the War of Beasts has left it a nearly defenseless broken shell of itself.
Laredian	Laredian was an Ordo Malleus Inquisitor Lord and the High Proctor of the Formosa Sector. Laredian was the one who led the Inquisitorial strikeforce which purged a group of Chaos Cultists that overran an Ecclesiarchy facility. He discovered a sole survivor, a 10 year old boy who became the famous Coteaz. Later, Laredian's downfall began after he discovered a Daemon bond crystal, during a Chaos Cult purge. He would later present the Daemon crystal[1a] to the Ordo Malleus' Conclave of Varoth, but doing so led Laredian to be declared Extremis Diabolus, by Inquisitor Lord Torquemada Coteaz. Before his peers, Laredian was proven to be a traitor by Coteaz, after admitting he sanctioned the use of Daemonhosts, read proscribed texts and employed the tools of Chaos[1b]. For his crimes, Laredian was immediately executed by Coteaz, who then fired his ashes into a star and was afterwards, declared the Formosa Sector's new High Proctor.[1a]
Cornelius Lavaslar Antrecht	Cornelius Lavaslar Antrecht is a psychic Thorian Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus. Antrecht was born on Menthusium II and was later collected by the League of Black Ships. It was while aboard the Black Ships that he was discovered by Inquisitor Bastalek Grim, which set a young Antrecht on a path that led him to become an Inquisitor of the Ordo Hereticus. Sometime later in his career, Antrecht journeyed to Danse Landing where he fought a cabal of Rogue Psykers that were led by the heretical Imperial Commander Gothburg. During the battle, Gothburg decided to use Antrecht as a Daemonhost and captured the Inquisitor, who was later tortured for weeks in preparation for his possession. Though this broke Antrecht and left him unconscious, the Inquisitor later awoke and was able to unleash a psychic attack, just as Gothburg and his Cabal summoned forth a Daemon from the Warp. The power behind Antrecht's attack not only killed killed Gothburg and his cabal, but also banished the Daemon back to the Warp. After surviving being tortured by the cabal and witnessing first-hand the power of possession, Antrecht soon left the Ordo Hereticus and began a journey that led him to join the Ordo Malleus.
Magos	A Magos (plural Magi) is a high ranking member of the Adeptus Mechanicus, and is a devoted disciple of the principles associated with the Machine God. These individuals have perfected as well as refined their field of expertise making them masters of a certain discipline. The Magos' dedication has led to their sacrificing great portions of their body in order to emulate the sacred form of the machine. After decades of service, a Magos has replaced many of his organs and limbs with superior cybernetic implants. As is fitting with the Cult Mechanicus, these replacement limbs and organs never tire or grow weak with age, thus highlighting the greatness of the Machine.[1b] Most devout of all is the Rite of Clear Thought, which replaces one hemisphere of the brain with augments to suppress irrational cognition.[1a] These senior Tech-Priests attend the Machine Altars of the Forge Worlds which contain the sum of knowledge of the Adeptus Mechanicus which in turn represents the will of the Omnissiah.
Naburus Baum	Naburus Baum was an Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus who led a force of Grey Knights during the First Scouring of Coriolanthe. He later died during the Scouring while fighting a fierce battle against two Chaos Warhound Titans; which resulted in the destruction of the Chaos Titans, as well as the deaths of the majority of the Grey Knights under Baum's command.
Arrius Balk	Arrius Balk was a Radical Ordo Xenos Inquisitor. He led expeditions to search out and collect Genestealer Broodlords for experimentation. However, the last one he collected alive, codenamed Specimen X, broke free of its restraints and over the course of a month it killed the crew of Balk's Inquisitorial Cruiser Confero. When the wreck of the Confero was discovered, a Deathwatch Kill-Team was sent to board it; but they found only the remains of the Cruiser's crew. As for Balk, no trace of him was ever found, though the Ordo Xenos learned that Specimen X managed to escape the Cruiser and began creating a Genestealer Cult on an Imperium world. The Kill-Team that boarded the Confero has now been charged with killing Specimen X and they have hunted down and destroyed every Genestealer Cult the Broodlord has created; though the creature itself has managed to escape their grasp and is now plaguing the war enveloped Antian Sector.
Ordo Chronos	The Ordo Chronos are an Ordo Minoris of the Inquisition that combat and prevent anomalies in time due to the use of Warp travel. The Ordo was established to study the anomalous passage of time during interstellar travel through the warp. This is because of the fact that time works differently within the empyrean; in rare circumstances, vessels can arrive at their destination much later than intended - for example taking centuries to arrive whilst only months have passed onboard the vessel while within the warp. Tales of such dreadful fates are common knowledge amongst void travellers and accepted as one of the risks of warp travel. In extremely rare circumstances vessels may even arrive back into realspace at a time before they actually set out. This Ordo is believed to have been established to study the temporal anomalies or other such effects that might emerge within the vicinity of the Jericho Reach with a view to controlling or combating them. Inquisitors of the Ordo Chronos were particularly concerned with the effects of time distortions that could lead to a disruption of the proper flow of time due to unintended interventions in the past. Such actions are deemed as interference in the fate of Mankind and against the will of the God-Emperor. Over the course of centuries, the Ordo Chronos expanded their mandate to relate to all forms of temporal phenomena and include other such events that might be a deliberate attempt to interfere with the flow of time.
Jaeger	Inquisitor Jaeger was a member of the Inquisition and the founder of the Ordo Sicarius, a minor Ordo of the Inquisition designed to oversee and monitor the Officio Assassinorum in the aftermath of the bloody Assassin Wars of Vindication. Jaeger pioneered the use of inserting "Assassin-Inquisitors" within the Officio, normal assassins who were nonetheless informants of the Inquisition. Using these moles, Jaeger stopped two plots by elements of the Officio Assassinorum to assassinate the High Lords of Terra and prevented the assassination of a Radical Inquisitor who had been dealing with Orks in the Lamina Sector. Jaeger's memoirs were later supressed by order of Inquisitor Madak.
Pavonis	Pavonis is an Imperial Mining World, and also a Tomb World where the Night Bringer was held in stasis. As a mining world, Pavonis was dominated by a set of large industrial cartels, the representatives of which composed the planetary Senate, with one of the leading cartel heads serving as planetary governor.[1a] The planet's tithes fell into arrears as a result of raids by Dark Eldar pirates, worker discontent, and the actions of a terrorist group called The Church of Ancient Ways.[1b] In reality, many of these events were orchestrated by Kasimir De Valtos, the head of the de Valtos cartel, who had discovered evidence of the Nightbringer's presence on their world and thought that by unleashing it he would gain immortality and ultimate power.[1c]
The Complete Games Workshop Catalog and Hobby reference - The 2004-05 Edition	A complete overview of the then current line of Games Workshop miniatures products, as well as "Classic" models. Miniatures replaced by newer models, for which rules are still available. Models not supported by the current rules, or just very old.
Adrastia	Adrastia was an Inquisitor of the Ordo Hereticus. She battled alongside the Imperial Guard under General Castor to secure the Aurelia Sub-sector in investigating the supposedly heresy of Blood Ravens Chapter Master Azariah Kyras. During the campaign, she willingly allied with Xenos forces such as Eldar and Orks.
Fidus Kryptman	Fidus Kryptman is an Inquisitor Lord of the Ordo Xenos, also known as the Hero of the Macharian Heresy. He is best known for being the first to formally recognise the Tyranid threat to the Galaxy and has fought in all three major Tyrannic Wars. Upon coming across the recently ruined Dead World of Tyran, Kryptman uncovered a protected data-codex and learnt about the unknown, cataclysmic alien race which had destroyed the world. After the planet Tyran, he gave the new alien threat the designation "Tyranids". He went on to warn Marneus Calgar, Chapter Master of the Ultramarines, of the oncoming Hive Fleet Behemoth. This allowed the Ultramarines to prepare for the conflict and to summon support from Battlefleet Tempestus, allowing them to defeat the Hive Fleet.
Bondorbia	Bondorbia is a Lord Inquisitor of the Imperium. She wielded a power mace, the head of which also doubled as her rosette of office.
First Scouring of Coriolanthe	The First Scouring of Coriolanthe began in 948.M38, when the Night Lords and an unidentified Traitor Titan Legion laid waste to the once gleaming marble cities of the Imperium world Coriolanthe. The Inquisitor Lord Naburus Baum led a strike force composed of the Grey Knights and the Red Talons Chapter in an attempt to halt the servants of Chaos, however, he was later killed along with the majority of the Grey Knights by a counter attack by two Chaos Warhounds. After the Inquisitor's death, the Night Lords and the Traitor Titan Legion reduced Coriolanthe to ruins.
Argyle	Argyle is an Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus and is among the few Inquisitors that are stranded within the Gilead System, due to the Great Rift's creation. The Inquisitor was noted to have recently met in secret with Tech-Priests of the Forge World Avachrus' Suspire priesthood. Soon afterwards, several combined teams of Argyle's retinue and Skitarii were reported to have removed artefacts from the ruins of the foundry-city Illiarch and then stored them within the Inquisition fortress, Imperia.
Exterminatus (Graphic Novel)	Exterminatus is a graphic novel published by Boom Studios which follows the story of Inquisitor Alastor as he investigates the appearance of a number of Chaos Titans and the repercussions this then has. The Protagonist of the story, Inquisitor Delius Alastor of the Ordo Malleus is shown fighting Lord Skyre of the Thousand Sons upon an unnamed battlefield, whilst his savant Savignien Pascal lies wounded at his feet, with the rest of his retinue slaughtered after taking down a large amount of heretics through bloody combat. The story cuts to a scene upon the Black Templar Battle Barge Mortifier controlled by Admiral Sallust, one month after the Torment Crusade. Alastor's wounds have healed and he and his savant are called to the planet of Magnum Christi and the city of Carrion Gulf. This is where 2 Chaos Titans have been found after the Black Templars cleansed the Thousand Sons and their cultist army from its surface, with the Cadian 450th Regiment having since come in to secure the zone. Upon planet fall Alastor is briefed by an Adeptus Arbites Chastener, Seargeant Hjordis T'sera, who then leads the inquisitor and Pascal down to the excavation cave, where Alastor, a Psyker, is hit by a wave of pain. He notices a large freight container which he then opens. Out leaps a large beast of the Thousand's Sons which slaughters a squad of Cadian's before Alastor can kill what appears to be an Untouchable Blank within the container. She is connected up to a amplifier of sorts which was used to boost her psychic shielding qualities during the excavation. Alastor, now able to use his powers now influences the Chaos beast and destroys it. The freight container is then discovered to belong to the House De Kyp, a large economic entity of the sub-sector. 11 Chaos Titans are found upon Magnum Christi with the lifiting of the pschic shielding and an Exterminatus is ordered upon it from the Mortifier. Alastor then travel's to Demaris Primary in search of the De Kyp's. He arrives, and is introduced to Sebastian and Agnetha, the son and daughter of since deceased Kaster who could actually manage the De Kyp business empire, whilst his children cannot. The Inquisitor questions them about the cargo container and the De Kyp's point them in the direction of the Damask brothers, Konstantin and Xavier, who they say have been commiting piracy against them. Alastor takes his leave and calls upon the Cadian 450th to assault the Khitaj Peninsula where the Damask brothers and their Skabian mercenaries are based in a fortified position. Upon breaching the fortifications, Alastor and T'sera find the brothers who tell them that the De Kyp's had hired them to raid there shipments so that they could secretly liquidate assets and pass it off as losses due to theft. Then a drop pod falls from the sky, containing a Chaos Dreadnought of the Thousand Sons.
Harrin	Harrin is an Ordo Hereticus Inquisitor who serves in the Askellon Sector and whose methods have made his fellow Inquisitors declare him a Radical. He denies the charges, though, and has said his accusers are unable to comprehend the scale of the threats he faces or fathom the consequences of what would happen should he fail in defeating them.
August Helden IIV	August Helden IIV the Elder/Younger is an Inquisitor of the Ordo Chronos. He wrote the text, Avoiding Becoming Your Own Grandfather And Other Paradoxes That Create Unnecessary Paperwork for the Administratum. It provides information on chronal dilation during Warp transit and the text is made available to Guardsmen within their regimental libraries.
Yusuph Trevar	Yusuph Trevar is a venerable Psyker Inquisitor of the Ordo Hereticus who has used his cunning to defeat the forces of Chaos for centuries. Relying on methodical trickery as an Inquisitor, he will pragmatically gather information on his foes before making a move against them. When he attacks, Trevar will deploy his wits to outsmart his foes and then annihilate them with arcane sciences and his own immense psychic powers. He later made one of his Acolytes, Victoria Aldrich, his Interrogator, specifically due to their clashing personalities and tactics when combating the forces of Chaos. She was his perfect counterbalance, as Victoria was known as a zealot who rooted out heretical and daemonic infestations with gusto. Under Trevar's training, however, her enthusiasm was tempered with his cunning and pragmatic planning, which has served Victoria well since she became an Inquisitor herself.
Allexei Macara	Allexei Macara is an Ordo Xenos Inquisitor, who took part in the Argovon Campaign as part of the Indomitus Crusade's Task Force XI. As the war against the Necron raged, Macara served in the Task Force's senior command staff as a representative of the Inquisition's Ordos.
Puritan	Puritans are a conservative political and philosophical faction of the Inquisition. To the conservative Puritans, it is of the utmost importance that Inquisition doctrine be upheld, and are often found persecuting those Inquisitors who are deemed heretical. They are in favor of the status quo and believe any evil, be it heresy, Chaos, or Xenos, should be shunned in all its forms. Puritans are known for their hostility and tension towards the other major faction of the Inquisition, Radicals.
First War for Armageddon	The First War for Armageddon is the least well known of the three Armageddon Wars, and involved the forces of Chaos and the Imperium. It was the culmination of years of preparation by the Daemon Primarch Angron, favoured of Khorne, to re-unify the World Eaters after their shattering at the hands of Khârn the Betrayer after the Battle of Skalathrax. The war began within the hated region known as the Eye of Terror. The forces within, being devoted to Chaos, usually fight each other, but occasionally and inexplicably they put aside their rivalries to form an assault on their common enemy, the Imperium. In this case, the unity of the powers of Chaos was triggered by the arrival of the Space Hulk Devourer of Stars around a Daemon World. The Hulk was large enough to carry a huge chaos force to attack Imperial worlds. The capricious currents of the warp drew the invasion force to the Imperial Hive World of Armageddon in 444.M41. Meanwhile, on Armageddon, a series of strange events culminated in armed rebellion breaking out in half a dozen hives. Armageddon consists of three main landmasses. Most human life is located on the main continent, which is split into two parts, Armageddon Prime and Armageddon Secundus, separated by the thick band of jungle known simply as the Equatorial Jungle. The revolts were quickly put down in Armageddon Secundus, but amongst the more widely scattered hives of Armageddon Prime they proved more difficult to eradicate. As the planetary defense forces seemed capable of dealing with the revolt, no additional units were sent by the Imperium. Armageddon was a very long way from the Eye of Terror, and no one suspected the cause for the revolts was more sinister than simple civil unrest.
Vortis (Inquisitor)	Vortis is an Ordo Xenos Inquisitor who investigated an outbreak of a Xeno-virus[1b] on the Hive World Kados.[1a] While there, he recruited the gang member Talon from the Kados Prime Hive, due to his fighting abilities.[1b] The Inquisitor would soon learn, though, that Talon also possessed a unique organism in his blood, that allowed the ganger to destroy the Xeno-virus infecting Kados. Talon's blood was then used to create a vaccine that ended the outbreak on the Hive World.[1a] However, this came too late to save Kados Prime and Vortis ordered the Hive to be destroyed, leaving Talon as one of its few survivors.[1b]
Mearghus	Mearghus was an Ordo Chronos Inquisitor, whose research for the Ordo led him to investigate a cabal of prescient Eldar psykers from the Craftworld Iyanden. He would later take his retinue to meet with the Iyanden Eldar aboard their ship's command bridge, in order to gain knowledge from the Xenos' abilities. The Eldar meanwhile had worked together with the Ordo Malleus to stop the forces of Chaos and believed that Mearghus had the same goal. The Inquisitor did nothing to dissuade them of this and watched as one of the Eldar Psykers cast its runes to learn of any threats to their Craftworld. The Eldar soon had an answer and stated that the Imperial Forge World Olvastis had to be destroyed, lest it later inadvertently be used to supply the armadas of the Chaos legions. Doing so would cripple an entire System, but the Eldar said it had to be done. Soon after saying this, though, the Legion of the Damned appeared and began firing upon the Eldar. The Xenos returned fire and also attacked Mearghus and his retinue, as they believed that the ghostly Space Marines were allied with the Inquisitor. In the battle that followed, Mearghus and the Iyanden Eldar cabal were killed, before the Legion of the Damned disappeared. However enough damage had been done to the Eldar's ship, that the Inquisitor's surviving retinue were able to be teleported away to safety.
Ereden Adorjin	Ereden Adorjin[1b] was a Daemonhunter of the Ordo Malleus active in early M41. It is believed by the Inquisition that if her deeds were widely known, she would have been hailed as an Imperial Saint.[1a] Adorjin was born a psyker, and early in her life she was consigned to the Black Ships. However, unbeknownst to all aboard, the young Adorjin had been possessed by a daemon known as Nekaybraianon. The daemon was brought onto the ship in her body and it was able to commit multiple atrocities on the psykers aboard the vessel on its way to Terra. However, with the help of Inquisitor Mardaine, Adorjin was able to achieve the remarkable: she mustered the will required to unbind the daemon from her and cast it out.[1a] With Mardaine as her mentor, Adorjin became an acolyte in service to the Ordo Malleus, eventually becoming an Inquisitor herself. Rather than sticking to a particular sector or region, Adorjin was a wandering Inquisitor. She started her career in Segmentum Solar and fought through into the Segmentum Pacificus.[1a]
Namira Suzaku	Namira Suzaku is a female Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus. Suzaku was one of the Imperial commanders in Honsou's Invasion of Ultramar and aided Uriel Ventris' final battle with Honsou on Calth. After the Chaos defeat, Suzaku has been doggedly hunting the Warsmith and seeks to put an end to him once and for all.
Lilean Chase	Lilean Chase was a Psyker and senior member of the Cognitae. Born at the time of the Great Crusade, Lilean Chase was a librarian in the Hall of Leng within the Imperial Palace. She became intertwined with Kyril Sindermann, Hellick Mauer, and eventually Ahzek Ahriman during the final stages of the Siege of Terra as the group attempted to scour the library for information on the Daemonic. After the Heresy, Chase joined the Inquisition. However, she later turned against the organization and joined the Cognitae, founding an academy on Hesperus in 321.M41. Undertaking eugenics and cloning experiments to create the perfect operatives, she created agents such as Zygmunt Molotch. However her academy was eventually wiped out by the Inquisition, apparently killing Chase. Alizebeth Bequin however later speculates that one of her Cogintae tutors, Mam Mordaunt, may in fact be Lilean Chase.
Kill Team Unit	Kill Team Units are small groups of warriors who are frequently assembled by their species to carry out missions that larger armies can not accomplish. This can require them to be capable of stealth, speed and flexibility, which leads to Kill Teams having a staggering amount of variety in their composition. They can be highly disciplined elite forces, remnants of much larger devastated forces, specially formed for specific tasks or gathered ad hoc as and when required. However they are assembled, or what mission they are given, Kill Teams are a vital force within armies and many commanders have won victories due to these small bands of warriors. There are even independent Kill Teams that are thrown together by the whims of fate or driven by a number of personal motivations, such as opportunism, greed or vengeance. Though even if they are carrying out the orders of far away commanders or pursuing their own vendettas against those who have wrong them, Kill Teams are an integral part of war in the Galaxy.
Necron Wars	The Necron Wars was a conflict in the Tarquin Stars, between the Imperium and the Necron.
Xenos	Xenos is an Imperial term synonymous with "alien" (from the human perspective), and refers to all non-human and extraterrestrial sentient species. The major alien races are the Orks, Eldar, Dark Eldar, Tyranids, Necrons and the T'au. All these races pose a considerable threat to the survival and continued dominance of mankind. There are countless other races but all are trivial by comparison.[Needs Citation] The Imperium considers humanity the rightful rulers of the whole galaxy. Part of the Imperial Creed is that all aliens judged to pose a threat to mankind's survival must be contained or destroyed. Aliens, along with mutants, heretics and deviants, are all considered enemies of mankind, for they threaten the very survival of the human race.[Needs Citation]
Calantis	Calantis is an Inquisitor active in the Calixis Sector and was once the master of the Inquisitor Octus Enoch. While serving as an Acolyte to Calantis, Enoch suffered a mind cleansing that caused him to lose his memory and control of his latent psychic abilities. In time, though, Enoch learned of his past life and began training to use his psychic powers. Calantis allowed this, but always had Enoch tested to ensure he did not fall to Heresy. Despite these precautions, the Inquisitor constantly weighed the decision to kill the Acolyte or to allow his training to continue. Enoch never failed Calantis' tests, however, and the Inquisitor later allowed a Acolyte Psyker to use their powers to undo his mind cleansing. The operation was ultimately a success and Enoch's full memory of his life were restored to him.

Council Exterra	The Council Exterra was formed as the Indomitus Crusade began and its members served as the representatives for the High Lords of Terra, in Lord Commander Roboute Guilliman's Fleet Primus[1b]. They were present during any high-ranking meeting Guilliman oversaw and ensured that their respective High Lord and organization's interests were spoken for.[1c] The Council's members defended Guilliman when his Imperial enemies criticised him for defending Ultramar during the Plague Wars. They claimed Guilliman was showing favouritism for his Homeland while other places needed his aid. The Council Exterra repeatedly refuted this, but its members did not have the authority of the High Lords, and the Imperial Palace's politicians claimed its members were merely Guilliman's lapdogs. The Council's mere existence was used as proof by critics that the Lord Commander desired to become the Imperium's next Emperor.
Danicha Hest	Danicha Hest is an Ordo Malleus Inquisitor who seeks to kill the Heretical Inquisitor, Vincenze Farradocias Kazymar. Her hunt for Kazymar began, when Hest witnessed the Prr'xakkatos Daemonhost being unleashed on Jhorvia V. The Agri World had been invaded by the Festerlung Brotherhood Warband, which was then attacked by the Prr'xakkatos soon after Inquisitor Kazymar's arrival there. When Kazymar's Cruiser, Blade Inevitable, then attempted to destroy the invaders with an orbital barrage, Inquisitor Hest intervened. Under her command, the Imperial Navy Battleship Hammerblow drove off the Cruiser and Agri World was left to its Chaos invaders. Hest meanwhile began to investigate Kazymar's connection to the summoning of the Prr'xakkatos, which led her to the Blessed Daemon Cult. Before the Cult was destroyed by her forces, Hest gained a confession of Kazymar's guilt and she now seeks to kill the fallen Inquisitor. However while Hest knows Kazymar is guilty, she thinks he truly believed that his action were helping the Imperium. The Inquisitor has told her Interrogator, Thorfas, that there is a lesson to learn from Kazymar's heresy, if they wish to avoid his fate.
Grigori Maldor	Grigori Maldor is an Inquisitor Lord and head of the Inquisition's Caligari Conclave.
Brand (Inquisitor)	Brand is an Ordo Malleus Inquisitor of the Askellon Sector, who believes that Daemons are lies given form. He says, though, to cast these fiends out, one simply needs to carry the Emperor's Truth with them - for against it, all lies crumble. At some point, he wrote a tome known as "Recollections of Inquisitor Brand".
Blakk	Blakk is an Ordo Xenos Inquisitor, who considers the Inquisition's lack of knowledge regarding how the Eldar's Wraith-constructs function, a danger to mankind's well-being. To rectify this problem, the Inquisitor longs to study a Wraith-construct with its Spirit Stone still intact, to determine how the Stone powers the Construct, but has only managed to study lifeless fragments.

Antigonus Balorodin	Antigonus Balorodin is an Thorian Inquisitor Lord, who is also known as the Expulgator of Thoth Prime. Antigonus was the youngest son of the Imperial Commander of the Hive world Polyphemia II, located in the Segmentum Solar, and spent his life being groomed for a career within the military of his home world. Balorodin's father was a staunch traditionalist who insisted that all his children serve a term of at least five years within the Planetary Defence Force, the Polyphemian Guard. As Antigonus was the youngest of the Governor's five sons and the three daughters, there was little prospect of him replacing his father; instead, it was suspected that he would remain within the Polyphemian Guard, where he might rise to the position of Colonel or possibly General, depending on his abilities. Unlike many Imperial Commanders, the elder Balorodin had no place for toadying or favouritism when it came to the defence of his home planet. Antigonus's training, therefore, was as rigorous as any other officer candidate's.
Augustus (Inquisitor)	Augustus is an Ordo Hereticus Inquisitor, who is famous for his conflict against The Creeping Shadow Cult. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Kleopatra Arx	Kleopatra Arx is an Ordo Malleus Inquisitor who served as the Inquisitorial Representative on the High Lords of Terra during the Thirteenth Black Crusade.[1b] Inquisitor Arx was known as a reformer who sought to overhaul and better unify the many orders and cabals of the Inquisition. She was one of the High Lords who supported Chancellor of the Imperial Council Lev Tieron's attempt to push through a dissolution of the Edict of Restraint that would free the Adeptus Custodes from their vows on Terra.[1a] Later during the crisis of the Noctis Aeterna and the formation of the Great Rift Kleopatra Arx proposed abandoning much of Terra to anarchy and instead have the overstretched and desperate Imperial forces focus on defending key facilities such as the Imperial Palace and Forbidden Fortress. This grim decision was supported by the likes of Master of the Administratum Irthu Haemotalion and Chancellor of the Imperial Council Lev Tieron, but they graciously let Arx take whatever blame for it might arise by dubbing it the Arx Doctrine.[1c]
Amalathian	"Who are you to second-guess the will of the Emperor? His plans are for Him and Him alone to know. It is enough fo us to know that his grand designs for the galaxy unfold as he has foreseen, and the colossal arrogance displayed by those who claim to act in his name is both dangerous and tantamount to heresy."- Inquisitor Barazano, following the Armageddon Schism. The Amalathians are a Puritanical faction of the Inquisition.[9a] The faction's name comes from Mount Amalath on Gathalamor upon which, at a great conclave, the first tenets of the Amalathian belief system were set down.[1a] The Amalathians believe that the Emperor has a grand plan and that it is unfolding as it should. They are therefore concerned with maintaining the status quo and react vehemently against change.[1a] They are less concerned about the threat of mutation, witchery and the like, and more active in ensuring there is harmony within the vast Imperial organizations, that any rivalries and discord are dealt with and kept to a minimum.[9a]
Empath	An Empath is a type of psyker that can sense emotions and feelings of other things and people. Empaths are capable of detecting lies, and interrogating prisoners, and other similar tasks. This article needs work on its citations.For help on citation see the citation guidelines. You can help Lexicanum by fixing it.
Jensus Natorian	Jensus Natorian (The Vengeful Son) is a member of the Deathwatch.[1a] Hailing from the Blood Ravens Chapter, Jensus is a Codicier Librarian. He has been under the eye of the Inquisition ever since his youth when he tore apart an ork mob with his bare hands to avenge the death of his parents and was later inducted into the Blood Ravens.[1a] In M41 Jensus Natorian took part in the purging of a Genestealer Cult on Ghosar Quintus as part of Kill Team Cassius.[1a]
Myctosa	Myctosa is an Ordo Xenos Inquisitor of the Askellon Sector, whose old master's Book of Hours had a verse stating you are not fit for the Inquisition, until you truly know how to hate. He feels, though, that you are not truly fit until you hate your fellow Inquisitors.
Blood Claw	Blood Claw (or Blooded Claw) is the first and lowest rank in the Space Wolves chapter, to which initiates are assigned after completing their basic training. Unlike Codex Chapters, which assign Neophyte Space Marines to begin their combat service as Scouts, the Space Wolves employ Neophytes as assault troops, allowing them to vent their youthful enthusiasm and lust for battle on the enemy.[1a] The Wolves believe that real combat is the best form of training, and encourage Blood Claws to take their place at the vanguard and learn the skills of battle firsthand. The Blood Claws hardly need encouraging - thrilled at having joined the ranks of the mythical Sky Warriors, and eager to forge their own personal sagas, they charge with berserker ferocity and a reckless belief in their own invulnerability. Such a berserker charge can turn the tide of a battle, but it also leads Blood Claws to take risks that are suicidal even for a Space Marine. For this reason, Blood Claw packs are usually led by a senior member of the chapter, such as a Grey Hunter or a Wolf Guard, whose duty it is to rein in the worst of their recklessness and mark out those who show real potential for advancement.[1a] A typical Blood Claw pack numbers between 5 and 15 marines.[1c] Casualties take their toll, and their numbers reduce quickly. To the Wolves, this is a necessary process to separate the men from the boys, and weed out those too weak, slow, or just plain unlucky, to become Grey Hunters.[1a] Some Blood Claws take longer to outgrow their reckless phase (and some never do at all). For these, the "reward" is usually assignment to a specialized unit that makes the most of their love for speed and willingness to charge headlong into the fray - either the Skyclaw assault packs or the Swiftclaw bike squadrons.[1d]
Meticulus	Meticulus is a Lord Inquisitor, who is undertaking a high stakes investigation into the fraudulent manufacturing of Purity Seals. He currently has a small retinue, as many of its members have died of old age in the last few years[1b]. Meticulus' newest member, is the recently joined Adepta Sororitas Fidelia, who now serves as Inquisitor's Interrogator.[1a] Meticulus has been called "more machine than man"[1d] and is physically connected with his throne.[1c] And he is shown only able to act if the throne has energy.[1e]
Callydia Benadice	Callydia Benadice is a Monodominant Inquisitor of the Ordo Hereticus.
Ario Barzano	Ario Barzano was an Ordo Xenos Inquisitor who was sent to the Imperium-held world of Pavonis to investigate the possible presence of C'tan and to uncover the true goals of the Dark Eldar raiders who plied the Pavonis system. He traveled to Pavonis with Captain Uriel Ventris and the Ultramarines 4th Company, who were personally assigned by Ultramarines Chapter Master Marneus Augustus Calgar to protect Inquisitor Barzano (the Ultramarines not knowing of Barzano's Inquisitorial status) at all costs[1a]. He hid in the guise of an Administratum adept, whose objective was supposedly in order to correct a number of problems ranging from corruption, Dark Eldar raidings, to the rise of a cartel-controlled terror group and political upheaval; all of which prevented Pavonis from fully paying its Imperial Tithe Grade. In his company was Lortuen Perjed, his aide and actual adept of the Administratum[1b].
Cartensus	Cartensus was an Ordo Malleus Inquisitor who served for 300 years and was one of the Ordos' foremost experts on the banishment of Daemons. His study on the nature and workings of Daemons, kept Cartensus' personal safe house on Scartia Dorath filled with many Heretical items. The most dreadful artefact was the 9 tomes of the Aevum Crucia, which contained the collected names of the Lord of Change known as the Prince of Silver Tears. Despite having such a profane collection, Cartensus had little in the way of defenses, as Scartia Dorath was ravaged by solar storms and radiation cascades. It was also located within a labyrinth of crystalline asteroid fields, that only the Inquisitor and a few trusted companions knew the coordinates needed to reach the world. Among them was the Grey Knights Justicar Ulleceus Barron, who Cartensus called upon for aid after the Thousand Sons, somehow managed to reach Scartia Dorath. The Traitors had come to claim the Inquisitor's Heretical collection, but he had hidden the tomes of the Aevum Crucia across the surface of his world. After the Thousand Sons had killed his Acolytes, their Sorcerers were able to tear the location of 7 of the tomes from his mind. Afterwards they left him for dead and began searching Scartia Dorath for the Aevum Crucia. Justicar Barron later arrived at Cartensus' home and the dying Inquisitor used his last worlds to warn the Grey Knight of what the Thousand Sons were searching for.
Tholome Marcs	Tholome Marcs is an Ordo Astra Inquisitor, who took part in the Argovon Campaign as part of the Indomitus Crusade's Task Force XI. As the war against the Necron raged, Marcs served in the Task Force's senior command staff as a representative of the Inquisition's Ordos.
Bataivah	Bataivah is the only name given for an Ordo Hereticus Inquisitor, who is part of the Sanctus Entente Cabal. It seeks to combat Abaddon the Despoiler's efforts to collapse the Sanctus Wall.
Ibrahim Matthias	Ibrahim Matthias is an Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos. He is most noted for his continual hunt for the infamous T'au-collaborating Rogue Trader Durandal Grohe. Matthias' task force consisted of three Cruisers, the Mars Class Battlecruiser Emendable (which has since been lost in the Warp), two Escort squadrons, and his Inquisitorial Cruiser. During his years-long hunt for Grohe and his xenos allied fleet, Matthias virus bombed the Imperial world of Koressa after it was found to be aiding the Tau and Rogue Trader.
Orchaedes	Orchaedes is an Inquisitor with a deep entrenched hatred for Psykers. This hatred led him to denounce the precognitive abilities of the Ultramarines' Chief Librarian Tigurius as evidence of his forbidden pacts with the dark powers of the Warp and demand an audience with Chapter Master Calgar to discuss the issue. Their meeting took place in the Temple of Corrections on Macragge, where more than a hundred Ultramarines watched as Orchaedes spat forth his anti-Psyker rhetoric. He only stopped his rant, which scorned the good name of Tigurius and the honour of the Ultramarines, when Calgar's voice cut through his tirade like a peal of thunder and Captain Sicarius issued a challenge, in his role as the Chapter's Knight Champion, under the laws of trial by combat. For his part, Orchaedes had a champion of his own, and from within his personal army of Acolytes emerged the battle-class Chrono-gladiator known as Naogotha, who launched itself at Sicarius. Though the Chrono-gladiator was heavily armoured and pumped full of combat drugs, Sicarius left his Talassarian Tempest Blade sheathed and used only his fists to pummel Naogotha. Their battle finally ended hours later, when Naogotha's drugs ran out and the Chrono-gladiator fell dead. With Orchaedes's champion defeated, Sicarius told the Inquisitor to take his retinue and leave Ultramar. Orchaedes was undaunted by his defeat, however, and stood in front of the Captain as he shrilled his anti-Psyker beliefs and insulted both Tigurius and Sicarius. It was then that the Inquisitor made a nearly fatal mistake, as he reached into his belt and grabbed his archeotech pistol... In a blur, Sicarius lunged forward and swung the Tempest Blade up, in a savage arc that struck Orchaedes's hand off while it still clutched the pistol. As the Inquisitor's hand hit the ground, Sicarius looked at the Inquisitor's retinue, as some went to Orchaedes's aid while others grabbed their weapons. With a snarl, the Captain ordered them to leave, as one hundred Ultramarines raised their Bolters at the retinue and Lord Calgar stood from his throne. Quaking with fear, Orchaedes's retinue quickly left the Temple of Corrections and let the enraged Inquisitor's cries for justice and vengeance against the Ultramarines go unanswered.
Ran Serastus	Ran Serastus is an Inquisitor who was sent by his Ordo, to the Crone World Belial IV during the Thirteenth Black Crusade, in order to discover what became of the archaelogica expedition lead there by Magos Tragan. Once he reached Belial IV, Serastus discovered that the Crone World had become a battleground between the Word Bearers and the Kabal of the Dying Sun, but this did not stop the Inquisitor and he infiltrated the world with his forces. However the Captain of the ship Serastus had used to reach Belial IV, did not feel the same and quickly departed from the Crone World, leaving the Inquisitor stranded. Despite this, Serastus continued his search for the Magos and later confirmed his colleagues' suspicions that Tragan and his expedition had been destroyed, though they had managed to uncover an ancient artefact, before they met their end. It had since been seized by the Word Bearers, who had begun constructing a shrine near the artefact, which prevented Serastus from studying it and determining exactly how the Magos had died. After witnessing the extent of the enemy forces on Belial IV, Serastus wrote a message to the Inquisition fortress on Alphus, claiming that due to the present situation, and the Crone World's troubled past history, the Astra Militarum should be sent to cleanse the blighted realm. Though he knew this would result in possibly billions of lives lost, he considered it a price worth paying due to the World Bearers' involvement. Before he finally sent the message, Serastus stated that since he was left stranded on the world, he would continue his mission and planned on infiltrating the Word Bearers' base around the artefact in order to study it. Serastus thought that with the Kabal constantly attacking the site, the Word Bearers would not notice his forces and if they did, he hoped he would at least uncover more information that could aid the Inquisition, before he died.
Golden Throne	The Golden Throne is an ancient and arcane device located in the Imperial Palace on Terra. It currently houses and sustains the remains of the Emperor of Mankind.[2a] The Golden Throne was thought to be an ancient relic dating back to the Dark Age of Technology which the Emperor discovered in sunken ruins within Asia's deserts, although even the Emperor Himself was unsure whether the idea was His, or to what extent the devices he discovered had served as inspiration. Another similar device likely used to test the technologies by whoever made it, known as Dark Glass, was also discovered by the Emperor during the Great Crusade and he set about restoring it as well. The Emperor then went to work to restore the device for his own ends, providing Human access to the Eldar Webway. Once installed under the Imperial Palace the Golden Throne took the form of a bulky machine-like chair suspended over gigantic mechanised doors made of gold metal. The doors were said to be large enough for a Warhound Scout Titan to walk through unbowed. The chair was linked to the portal by huge bundles of cables, wires and conduits. The whole machine was made of the same golden metal. The throne was built at one end of a vast hall big enough to house up to six fully equipped Space Marine Companies. This was the Emperor's main laboratory, which was itself at the centre of his underground complex, known as the Imperial Dungeon. Even after the Throne's construction, the lab remained littered with other huge machines and storage crates. Hundreds of red-robed technicians and labourers worked in the lab.[1a] According to Pieter Achelieux, the Golden Throne would have required an extremely powerful Psyker to operate and implied that one of the Primarchs may have been designed for this role. The Emperor's disappointment with Magnus the Red's betrayal suggests that he was intended to sit upon the throne.
Okal Nusa	Okal Nusa is an Ordo Militarum Inquisitor of the Sanctus Entente Cabal, which seeks to combat Abaddon the Despoiler's efforts to collapse the Sanctus Wall.
Blood and Fire (Novella)	War for Armageddon: The Omnibus Blood and Fire is a novella by Aaron Dembski-Bowden in the Space Marine Battles (Novel Series), released in July 2013. The novella was selected by Guy Haley in May 2014 as part of Black Library's "Author's Choice" marathon.
Hrexus Arkthine	Hrexus Arkthine is an Inquisitor who died long ago and is buried within a grand tomb, on the Mausoleum World Harlecrypt Tertius. He personally placed traps to protect his tomb and ensured a ceremonial guard stood watch over it. However these were put to the test during the Prosperan Rift War, when Harlecrypt Tertius was invaded by the Thousand Sons. In the end, though, despite Arkthine's many defenses, and additional forces that came to protect it, his tomb still fell to the Thousand Sons, during the invasion. Afterwards, the forces of Interrogator-Lieutenant Idon Throom came upon the Inquisitor's tomb and learned that the Sorcerer Phosis Anen Maat's Warpcoven was responsible for the attack. They then searched the wrecked tomb and discovered that the Warpcoven had desecrated Arkthine's corpse. It also appeared that the Thousand Sons had escaped with a large number of valuable objects, that had been buried with the Inquisitor.
Korsk II	Korsk II is a world of the Imperium.[1a] Korsk II is a backwater world remarkable only as a juncture in patrol and trade routes between the Tamahl Sector and the Stygies Forge Worlds. The largely peasant population of Korsk II toils while a technocratic elite rules from a handful of cities, planetary governorship being held by the Autarch Primus of the board of directors. Thanks to its moderate strategic importance and a recent rebellion (the so-called 'Regime of Iron', which was crushed by the Imperial Navy), Korsk II is routinely garrisoned by several regiments of Imperial Guard. In 995.M41 Varlak, a rogue psyker of prodigious power, used his powers to instigate a rebellion on Korsk II. Thanks to his unique psychic ability to convince anyone he spoke to do as he said, no mater how outrageous, he enraptured the Imperial Guard to his side and easily overthrew the Planetary Governor. Taking the title of Lord, Varlak declared himself Korsk II's saviour, while denouncing the Emperor as an enemy of the planet, and stated they would be seceding from the Imperium under his rulership. Varlak's rebellion might have gone unnoticed for some time if it had not been for the work of Inquisitor Marcus, who had by chance been on the planet when Varlak took control. Realizing the danger Varlak represented, Marcus quickly dispatched a message to the Adeptus Terra telling of the Psyker's rebellion and within days forces from the Blood Angels, Dark Angels, Space Wolves and Ultramarines Chapters made planetfall.[1a]
Horusian	The Horusians are a radical faction within the Inquisition, related to the Thorian and Xanthite factions, who believe that the power of Chaos that manifested in Warmaster Horus might be harnessed for the creation of a Divine Avatar. The Horusians share much with the puritan Thorian faction's core ideology of the resurrection of the Emperor, which in fact dates back to the very end of the Horus Heresy, long before the Thorians' namesake Sebastian Thor lived. Two of the original founders of the Inquisition, Promeus and Moriana, looked into means by which the ruler of mankind might be resurrected. However after Moriana began to look to Dark Powers in her quest, Promeus and his followers banished the Inquisitor to the Eye of Terror. The disciples of Promeus, the Promeans, began a quest over many centuries to restore the Emperor to a mortal body.[1a] Eventually, a splinter faction of the Promeans, the Horusians, began to form. These disciples were continuing the work of Moriana, collecting texts on the nature of Horus and his possession by Chaos. These tomes, considered heretical, brought Promeans and the Horusians into conflict. In the end however the Horusians prevailed, and few true Promeans remained by M34. Eventually, Stalia von Dressen was able to organize anti-Horusian cells across the Imperium. Eventually her crusade led her to research the nature of the Emperor's resurrection and the founding of the Inquisition for two decades on Terra, leading her to believe that resurrection was a hopeless cause. This led her to lead an anti-resurrectionist purge within the Inquisition. By M35 resurrectionism was once again all but eliminated from the Inquisition's goals.[1a] Inquisitorial Representative Vult commissioned Hesh, a Black Priest of the Order of Abhorrence to confirm the extinction of the Horusians who concluded that the philosophy had been eradicated.[4b]
Xanthier	Xanthier is an Ordo Xenos Inquisitor. Sometime in early M42, the Inquisitor's Cognitiator-Prime, Jalek Thou, informed him that the once thought dead Warboss Grukk Face-rippa, had been seen leading an invasion of the Bargheist Stars.
Ultheka Yannis	Ultheka Yannis is a Lord Inquisitor.
Covenant	Inquisitor Covenant is an Ordo Malleus Inquisitor and a psyker, who possesses limited psychic abilities. As part of those Inquisitors who have made it their duty to purge the Inquisition itself of perceived corruption, he is particularly focused in his Inquisitorial duties, especially on destroying the Daemonhosts created by the more Radical Inquisitors of the Ordo Malleus.[1a] Covenant was trained by Inquisitor Argento, but along with Inquisitor Idris were forced to slay their master after he attempted to create a Living Saint to hold the Emperor's spirit. Afterwards the duo were both named full Inquisitors of the Ordo Malleus.[3a] He later took part in the Siege of Malogrim Hive and is responsible for the training of Daemonhuntress Ivixia Dannica. Recently he has begun hunting Radical Inquisitors within his order. This brought him into conflict with the heretical Inquisitor Goldoran Talicto.[3b] However upon being accused on Ero Talicto revealed his plans to murder the entire Inquisitorial conclave present there by overloading the Ero Reliquary Tower's Plasma Generator and assume command of the Caradryad Crusade. Revealing he also commanded a force of assassins known as The Renewed, fierce fighting broke out across Reliquary Tower.Idris died preventing the plasma reactor overloading but it was revealed that Talicto was in fact an impostor, the real Inquisitor had died years ago and had been replaced by an agent of The Triumvirate.[3c] Teaming up with Inquisitor Vult, Covenant chased The Triumvirate to a hidden asteroid base but were assailed by unleashed Daemons. Thanks to the sacrifice of Vult, Covenant and his retinue were able to escape The Archive before it was destroyed by the traitor Frigate Truth Eternal.[3d]
Heleana Jerico	Lady Jena Orechiel was a female Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos who was known amongst the ranks of the Inquisition for her blatant use of Xenos weaponry. She was the daughter of an estranged planetary governor, an acolyte in Inquisitor Dargasto's retinue before his death, and the mother of Kal Jerico. In her youth, she enrolled at the Schola Progenium of Ophilla, where she was constantly in trouble due to her extreme stubbornness and fierce convictions. One Drill Abbot, Belphus Meere, a retired Mordian Sergeant, even made it his personal mission to control her, but still she refused to bend to his will. Despite being overdue for transfer to the Sisterhood, the Schola Progenium deemed Jena to be "unprepared" and held her back. An agent of the Inquisition eventually arrived to assess her as a potential recruit, and agreed with the Chief Abbot's recommendations that Jena's steadfast determination and un-foundering drive were worthy traits of an Inquisitor. However, he deemed her "unprepared" still, remarking that her youth and pride were major obstacles that still needed to be overcome. This meeting changed Jena's life, and she soon launched herself into her studies with renewed vigour. Once Jena had reached a mature enough age, she was inducted into Inquisitor Dargasto's retinue, who shared her remarkable fascination with Xenos species and cultures. She was made a full Inquisitor after Dargasto died in a firefight with a Mechanicum Magos and his entourage of Techpriests during a search for an alien device that may have pointed to the reawakening of the C'tan. One of her first acts as an Inquisitor was to re-visit the Schola Progenium that she had enrolled in her youth and sequester her old "friend" Belphus Meere into her retinue.
Cognitae	The Cognitae is a mysterious heretical sect described as a shadow-twin of the Inquisition.[2a] According to Criol Fowst, the Cognitae, or some version of it, had existed within the Imperium for millennia, as far back as before the Great Crusade. Before the Horus Heresy a secret society known as the Cognitae was known to Kasper Hawser. A vision by Ollanius Persson puts the Cognitae as far older than even this, showing a predecessor of the Cult active in Terra's ancient past before recorded history. Here, the Cognitae attempted to erect a Chaos-channeling tower etched in Enuncia but were foiled by the Emperor and his armies, led by Ollanius. The Cognitae also spawned several offshoots and imitators, some of which tried to recruit Fowst. He found some ideals in common with them, but ultimately rejected them in favour of his "true" calling, as a cultist in service to the Word Bearers.
Bastapol Harg	Bastapol Harg was an Inquisitor whose investigation into a series of murders led him to the Hive World Falchat. There Harg discovered the Khornate Cult behind the murders and destroyed it, but in doing so brought doom to the Hive World. The Cult the Inquisitor destroyed had paid fealty to the Bloodgorged Warband and they soon fell upon Falchat with a vengeance, murdering Harg and anyone else they could find.
Keeper of Secrets	Keepers of Secrets are the Greater Daemons of Slaanesh. Created subconsciously by the Prince of Pleasure, these Daemons are the ultimate manifestation of his desire for physical excess and pleasure in battle. Each Keeper of Secrets has a unique appearance that mirrors Slaanesh's mood at the time of its creation. Their looks can range from terrifyingly-haunting-but-almost human to bestial, though all are tall and lithe with long claws and limbs and a crown of horns that sprouts from their head and intoxicating eyes that look like black crystals. As well as being vicious warriors, Keepers of Secrets are also capable of weaving powerful spells of misdirection and mystification. They invade the thoughts of their enemies, sending them visions of glory, titillating their egos, and caressing their inner desires to lead them astray. They seek to give and receive sensation in all forms, be it pain or pleasure, but there is nothing more enjoyable to them than the corruption of the noble and pure. They also are surrounded by a breeze that confuses all enemies around and allows the daemon to prey on them easily.
Miranda Blithia	Miranda Blithia is a Ordo Malleus Inquisitor of the Askellon Sector and is known to search for Humans possessed by Daemons. The Inquisitor will then free them from the Daemon and forcibly recruit these now hardened survivors, as part of her retinue. Known as the Everdamned, they view Blithia as their mistress and savior and serve her faithfully. The Inquisitor, however, views each of the Everdamned as merely expendable weapons to be used in her endless battles against Daemons.
Cherone	Cherone is an Ordo Malleus Inquisitor who sought out a Keeper of Secrets on the world Laurentix, but was defeated and left for dead by the Daemon. He survived the scarring wounds inflicted on him by the Daemon and, once he had recovered, Cherone tracked down and confronted the Keeper on Volandis, where it had possessed the world's Planetary Governor, Leonora. With the aid of the Grey Knights, Preachers and a Company of Tekarn Iron Fists Guardsmen, Cherone attacked the Keeper, who soon fully manifested to its true form and continued their battle.
Hive Fleet	Hive Fleets are massive locust-like Tyranid swarms, comprising billions of creatures including the actual bio-ships, living spacecraft used to cross interstellar space and the voids between galaxies. Each creature of the Hive Fleet is an inseparable part of the Hive Mind. An entire Hive Fleet is directed by the single coordinating will which is its Hive Mind, formed from untold billions of individual consciousnesses, each of which is a living creature in the fleet. Mankind still searches vainly for the higher beings they suppose control the Hive Fleets, and though such mighty creatures exist, they no more control the Hive Mind than single brain cells control a man's body. It is the sum of the Hive Mind which motivates it, not its constituent parts. Three major Hive Fleets have invaded the galaxy, each coming into conflict with the Imperium. Of the three major Hive Fleet invasions, two entered the galaxy through the Eastern Fringe, but one is moving up from below the galactic plane. The Hive Fleets encountered thus far are just a splinter of the main Tyranid invasion force that is traveling through the void between galaxies.
Kya Tellemain	Kya Tellemain was an Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus who investigated the death of the Lord Militant of the Achilus Crusade, Tiber Achilus. After Achilus’s vessel, the Proclamation of Wrath, was lost to the Warp, Tellemain led a secret inquest into his death, not willing to believe the official reports. She spent the next few years examining logs and hunting down leads that, unfortunately, lead nowhere. Eventually, she was forced to stop her search by the new Lord Militant, Solomon Tetrarchus, with little to show for investigation. Strangely, Tellemain herself would mysteriously disappear while on a mission in the Jericho Reach and once word reached her Acolytes they went into hiding.
Kharkov	Kharkov is an Askellon Sector Ordo Hereticus Inquisitor, who believes his Ordo's foes lurk everywhere Mankind lives and breathes.
Ardeus Teth	Ardeus Teth is an Ordo Astartes Inquisitor, who wonders what kind of secrets and artefacts the Space Marine Chapters must keep within their hidden vaults and libraries. He has gone so far as to say he would sacrifice a dozen worlds for just a glimpse of such treasures and a hundred to own them.
Malice	The name or term "Malice" might refer to:
Sanctuary 101	Sanctuary 101 was an Adepta Sororitas Fortress-Convent[1a] of the Order of Our Martyred Lady[1b] with Sister Purity as a mistress of the community. It was established on the barren and lifeless planet with the same name located in the Vidar Sector on the Eastern Fringes. Sanctuary 101 was a place of great holiness and inhabited by Sisters who seek to redeem the sins of Mankind through self-denial, rigorous prayers and ritual mortification of the Flesh. Millions of years ago, before the War in Heaven, the planet which the Imperium would name Santuary 101 had a native species, who were conquered and subjugted by the necrons of the Thokt Dynasty under an overlord Onryx, who looted the planet's resources, to much glorification among the necrontyr. Sanctuary 101 was the site of first open contact between the Imperium and the Necrons, in 897.M41.[1a] The Necron Sautekh Dynasty led by Phaeron Imotekh the Stormlord took part in the attack. Despite a valiant effort and attempting to preserve all records that they could on these new enemies, all the Sisters inside the Sanctuary were killed and had their skin flayed by the Necrons. Video picts were recorded during the battle, but only showed the Sisters being cut down by flickering shadows.[1a]
Chan	Chan is an Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos. Chan has studied and written a detailed report on the known history of the Kroot mercenary warband known as the Seven Wings Coalition. Due to their large size and the highly effective physical adaptions they have undergone during battle, Chan deemed them as a potential threat to the Imperium in his report dispatched in 367997.M41. Chan also requested aid be sent to him, in the report, in case the Seven Wings Coalition needed to be dealt with soon, before they grew too powerful.
Bilocke	Bilocke is an Inquisitor who was involved in the Necron Wars.
Hesperus (Planet)	Hesperus is a world of the Imperium, located in the Helican Subsector.[3a] At some point prior to 241.M41 Hesperus suffered from the predations of a cult. The cultists were known to remove their dead victims' eyes, due to their belief that the eyes were the windows of the soul. In 241.M41, Hesperus was host to an Imperial secessionist movement that came under investigation by the Inquisition.
Caius Wroth	Caius Wroth is an Inquisitor and formidable Psyker who is taking part in the Traxis Sector Conflict.
Aegult Caidin	Aegult Caidin is an Inquisitor Lord, who chairs the Inquisition's Calixian Conclave within the Calixis Sector.[1a][1b] Ha has had that possition for the past two hundred years, though respectful of the Lord Sector, Caidin answers to no one except the distant High Lords. From the Tricorn Palace on Scintilla, he supervises and directs the general policies and activities of the Inquisitors under his command, as well as individual specialist cabals of Inquisitors sent on “special circumstance” missions.[1b] He is a shadowy figure who is only ever seen in public wearing a mask that obscures the Inquisitor Lord's features and his true identity. Supposedly he keeps his true likeness secret, even from close aides and allies, so as to be free to operate unmolested and unrecognised. His true age is not known.[1b] Caidin and the High Council do their best to keep the scattered Inquisitors moving with a unified purpose, but sometimes they have to arbitrate disputes.[1c] At the same time it is said that Caidin likes a degree of rivalry between his subjects, all the better to ensure that they are working at their best.[2c]
Bors Callimue	Bors Callimue is a Radical Ordo Xenos Inquisitor, who received a plea for aid from the priest of G-X-17. He investigated the Agri World and this led to the discovery of the Skorl Xenos. However, Bors found the Skorl to be a remarkable species, that did not warrant being destroyed over the loss of a few hundred fungus farmers. The Inquisitor felt that the Xenos' weapon technology alone, demanded that peaceful trade be established between the Imperium and Skorl. In order for that to happen, Bors decided to offer the Skorl the right to prey upon G-X-17's population, without worry of Imperial retribution. At least until, the Imperium could reverse-engineer the Xenos' technology. Once that happened, the Inquisitor would make sure the Skorl were destroyed. Bors then thanked the Emperor for his divine inspiration in solving the Inquisitor's problem.
Soldevan	Soldevan is an Inquisitor of the Ordo Hereticus active in the Calixis Sector. Originally an Interrogator serving Rykehuss, he broke with the Witch Finder after his own promotion. Soldevan believes that knowledge is the key to protecting humanity, which clashed with the Puritan's views. He has quickly turned Radical, believing that the Warp is a source of knowledge and power and that a man of sufficient intelligence can harness it. Thus he seeks to open a pathway to the Warp and seek out the consciousness that dwells within, bargaining with them for the power he needs to combat the enemies of mankind. This has led Soldevan to collect many dark Chaos artefacts. Somewhere during the process, he has lost his sanity.
Evangelyne Karlzan	Evangelyne Karlzan is a Radical Psyker Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus, who is of the Xanthite faith and is active in the Askellon Sector. She was born the Shrine World Ossuar and served in the Adeptus Ministorum, until Karlzan's Psychic abilities were discovered. This led her to be taken by the Black Ships, but Karlzan managed to escape after another psyker's power caused them to explode. Some time later, she became an Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus, but while Karlzan is still faithful, she is now a Xanthite Radical. Karlzan's retinue is currently looking into an outbreak of deaths on Desoleum, caused by the usage of the illegal drug Spook. While they did manage to track down a Spook dealer, they discovered that he had already suffered an explosive death, due to an overdose of the drug. The Spook deaths have now begun to worry Karlzan, as they are similar to the death that freed her from captivity on a Black Ship. Though her retinue continues to search for more dealers, they have been noticed by the dead dealer's associates, as well as an undercover member of the Sanctionary Enforcers. Neither group, however, is aware of the retinue's true identities or their connection to Karlzan.
Death Cult Assassin	Death cults are extreme cults characterized by their worship through bloodshed, and can be found on many Imperial worlds.[1a] While many of these cults serve Khorne the Blood God, others are extreme sects of the Imperial Cult and fanatically loyal to the Emperor of Mankind. As the Emperor sacrifices himself for mankind's continued survival, these cults in return slay the enemies of the Emperor, offering them as sacrifices. Death cult assassins are often utilised by the Inquisition, the assassins' skill in the arts of killing making them excellent executioners and infiltrators. They employ exotic ritual weapons for their work: stilettos and blades backed by digi-weapons and needlers.[1a][2b] They specialize in ritual murder and assassination with the art of the blade being paramount to the Cult. Different forms of incisions, lacerations, punctures, the type of the weapon used, the part of the body that has been struck all have special significance to dedicating the soul to the Emperor. Many of the ritual weapons used and lovingly maintained by the Cult are highly specialized. They range from knife-rings to whip-scythes with more fanciful and symbolic weapons including cross shaped throwing knives or knives made from the bones of the faithful or heretical.[2b]
Malfi	Malfi is a Hive World of the Imperium, located eight hundred days standard from Scintilla, the main population and manufacturing focal of the rimward territories of the Calixis Sector. Malfi is a semitropical, gloomy world of overbuilt hives and habitation ledges. Its population approaches that of Scintilla and it subsists on its engineering and metalwork industries. Malfi has a grudge: it believes it should be the sector capital world and venomously protests the supremacy of Scintilla. Certainly, with its super-continental hives and eradication of natural landscape, Malfi resembles a Solar Hive World far more than any of the other worlds in the sector and its claim for capital eminence seems reasonable. However, politics and demographics are fickle mistresses. Scintilla is better placed to provide a centre of effective governance for the sector. Early regimes, following Lord Militant Angevin's campaign, made their headquarters on Malfi but the province has spread out since then. Despite its efforts, Malfi remains a border world, colossal in both its consumption and its production. It satisfies itself in commanding the Malfian subsector, ruling the territories rimward and spinward of Scintilla. The subsector governor, Jendrous Kaffiq, answers only to Lord Sector Marius Hax himself. Malfi is a seat of the Administratum and several chief banking houses. Its nominal ruler is the Eminence Glydus Matriarch.
Foulway Tor	Foulway Tor is a Rogue Trader. He has led three expeditions to the Eastern Fringe and the Taronian 7th Regiment was lost, during Tor's last expedition there.
Red Thirst	The Red Thirst is one of the two major Gene-Seed defects within the Blood Angels and their Successor Chapters, the other being the Black Rage. The Red Thirst is a genetic flaw deeply embedded into the Blood Angels Gene-Seed. When Sanguinius became aware of it, he felt responsible for the suffering of his sons and desperately sought out a cure while keeping it secret from the rest of the Imperium, including the Emperor himself. A warrior who had succumb too deeply to the Red Thirst or Black Rage was sometimes executed by Sanguinius himself, an act he reluctantly carried out. While isolated instances of Battle-Brothers succumbing to the Red Thirst occurred throughout the Great Crusade, it was not until the Battle of Signus Prime that the entire Legion suffered from it. The Red Thirst causes warriors to suffer an unusual bloodlust, instilling them with a thirst for the blood of their enemies. Those who succumb to the Red Thirst or Black Rage are either formed into the Death Company or locked away in the Tower of the Lost on Baal, until they change completely, going insane. These traits have also been passed on to their successor chapters, such as the Flesh Tearers, Blood Drinkers, and Angels Sanguine. One successor chapter, the Lamenters, was until recently thought to have managed by unknown means to eliminate the flaws from Sanguinius' gene-seed, but has been stricken by extraordinary bad luck in battle and as such has been nearly annihilated. The Red Thirst is so overwhelming that the Blood Angels forget their noble heritage and completely lose control over themselves. It is not unheard of that Blood Angels squads abandon advantageous positions to engage the enemy in hand-to-hand combat. More often than not, these assaults turn out to be so devastating that unprepared enemy forces are simply swept away.
Obodiah Roth	Obodiah Roth is an Ordo Hereticus Inquisitor Psyker. Trained in a Schola Progenium, Roth became a psychic dueler and learned how to combat psykers in the physical and psychic realms at the same time during a fight. While his abilities were not powerful, the Scolam's staff taught Roth how to focus it in an instant in order to deliver a devastating psychic strike. When his training was complete, Roth was recruited to serve as Ordo Hereticus Inquisitor Liszt Vandevern' Interrogator. Vandevern was a prolific field inquisitor who believed a raid would always reap more answers than clinical investigation. Because of this, Roth had fought with half a dozen Heretic Cults, and even besieged the compound of a Narco-baron on Sans Gaviria before his 30th year. Sometime later, Roth became an Inquisitor himself in 866.M41 and for his first investigation, the Ordo sent him to investigate mild psychic disturbances emanating from Sirene Primal.
Genestealer Cult	A Genestealer Cult is a community of Genestealers, genestealer hybrids, as well as the completely human convert-hosts, infected victims and genetic relatives known as Brood Brothers, existing within another society. Genestealer cults form if a Genestealer infects members of another species with its genetic code. The resultant changes in the genome of the host cause a fanatical loyalty to the genestealers, as well as a drastic change to their reproductive system; their firstborn children will be hybrids, a grotesque mixture of the host's race and genestealers. These hybrids infect further victims, and the infection spreads exponentially. Fourth generation hybrids produce purestrain genestealers, and the cycle starts once again. This brood of purestrains, hybrids, and neophytes is held together by strong psychic and genetic bonds, and assembles around the original genestealer, which becomes the patriarch. Because this community is often hidden behind the facade of a religion or political movement, it is called a genestealer cult by the Imperium. As the cult's numbers grow, more specialized types of hybrids are created to serve the patriarch, which is now worshiped as a god. These include magi, primuses, loci, etc.. The cult will often grow and plot below the surface of their host world, using this base of operations to gradually infiltrate into the above society. Later generations are less monstrous than their forbears and can freely walk among Imperial society without much notice. Often a genestealer cult will recruit from the downtrodden underbelly of society, characterizing themselves as liberators from the brutal yoke of Imperial rule. A fully mature cult can be huge, numbering in the billions and covering several worlds.[18a]
Jauseth Septima	Jauseth Septima was a world of the Imperium. In M40, Jauseth Septima was discovered to be harbouring a Genestealer infestation. Inquisitor Dethrec Balthagar and Space Marines of the Deathwatch led a purge of the planet. Believing that they had thoroughly scoured Jauseth Septima, Inquisitor Balthagar and his allies departed. Unbeknownst to them, however, a Genestealer cultist had left the planet in a cryopod shuttle three weeks prior to the purge. He later returned to Jauseth Septima and, within three years of Balthagar's death, the planet had once again been infested.
Chaegryn	Chaegryn was an Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos. In mid-M41, he discovered the first major Genestealer Cult in the Imperium upon Ghosar Quintus. Chaegryn was eventually killed by a swarm of Genestealer Hybrids, though his death would be avenged by a Deathwatch Kill-Team led by Ortan Cassius.
Hammer and Bolter 17	Hammer and Bolter issue 17 was released in February 2012.
Monodominant	You ask why we must clense the xenos. I will tell you. the filth of the alien an the witch must be exterminated to preserve the purity of the Human race, lest we degenerate into abominations — Witch Hunter Tyrus at the Conclave of Vena Monodominants are an extremist Puritan faction of the Inquisition known for their uncompromising prosecution of perceived enemies of the Imperium. Founded by Inquisitor Goldo in M33 and later revitalized by Jeriminus of Paelutia, as their name implies, they are of the firm belief that the Imperium, and only the Imperium, should be allowed to exist. They are zealous supporters of the concept of manifest destiny, and believe that this is only achievable by the extermination of all threats and impurities. Xenos, witchcraft, heresy, blasphemy, mutation and civil disobedience are crimes punishable by death in the eyes of a Monodominant and those accused of such crimes can expect no reprieve. They see the Imperium's war as a racial struggle of survival, and hope to kill enough aliens, mutants, psykers, and other "inhuman" beings that natural selection will be allowed to take its course and Humanity will rise to the position of ultimate power.
Carmillas	Inquisitor Carmillas was a member of the Ordo Xenos studying a new xeno species which had been found in mercenary groups around the Ghoul Stars. On a small outpost on an unnamed world, she and her staff conducted psychic tests on one of the xenos she had captured, turning the xeno into an unknowing spy. She had it returned to its species to gather information for her to determine if the species was a threat to the Imperium. When it was done the xeno returned to the Inquisitor, but members of its species tracked it down and attacked the outpost. Carmillas and her staff were killed in the battle.
Castinus	Castinus was an Inquisitor of the newly created Ordo Hereticus when he led a quarantine team to search a missing Black Ship that was discovered in the Medrenax Nebula. Within it he found a bloodbath, as the Black Ship was filled with the mangled bodies of its crew and passengers, save for the powerful psykers known as the Apex Twins. When Castinus asked if they were responsible for the massacre aboard the Black Ship, the physically weakened Apex Twins readily admitted to doing so, without any hesitation. For reasons known only to himself, Castinus did not kill the Twins, perhaps because he was unknowingly influenced by their physic power, and instead brought them to the Inquisition fortress of Nemesis Tessera for analysis and study. This would have horrifying consequences, though, as the Apex Twins were able to regain their full power and freed themselves from their cells. What followed was a massacre, as the Twins began a murderous rampage that saw almost a thousand Inquisitorial troopers slaughtered as well as scores of full Inquisitors, before they made their escape. It is not known if Castinus was among those who were killed.
Hapshant	Hapshant was an Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos and was the one time master to Gregor Eisenhorn and Titus Endor. They both rose to the rank of Interrogators in Hapshant's service, before he contracted deadly Cerebral Worms parasites which began to devour his brain. Though he began to descend into lunacy, Titus and Eisenhorn served loyally under Hapshant until his death when the damage caused by the worms became too much for his body to handle. As Hapshant collapsed and began to spasm, both of his Interrogators were by his side, with Titus trying in vain to wipe away the worms emerging from his mentor's eyes as he died. After Hapshant's death, Titus and Eisenhorn went on to became Inquisitors themselves and began their own careers. Years later it was discovered that Titus Endor's own deteriorating memory and odd behavior were the result of Cerebral Worms. It is believed that Titus contracted the Worms from Hapshant years earlier, and it was only shortly before his own death from the parasites, that his condition was diagnosed.
Pilgrims of Hayte	The Pilgrims of Hayte are a Chaos Cult, active in the Calixis Sector. An apocalyptic murder-cult, the Pilgrims of Hayte are known for their viciousness and atrocities. Mere rumors of their presence in a particular area is enough to create near-panic among the populace. Their goal is a simple one: to destroy the Imperium and slay those serving the Emperor. The cult's teachings and recruitment focus on the downtrodden, outcast, and criminal elements of Imperial society. Their core belief is that of nihilism of the spirit and utter despair, viewing humanity as a squalling blind creature at the mercy of the cosmos. To them, civilisation, faith, reason, and love are all lies and dreams concocted by the Imperium to maintain their control. Thus the Pilgrims seek to sow destruction and terror in order to tear down this false reality. The Pilgrims of Hayte are defined by the Ordo Hereticus as a "cancer cult", as like a cancer they quietly and slowly infiltrate the unseen areas of Imperial society by establishing hidden cells that grow from within, until finally they become too widespread and powerful to oppose. Once firmly planted on a world, they will orchestrate a campaign of wanton madness and destruction. They often employ suicidal attacks by insane zealots coinciding with terrorist acts. Finally, they will unleash Daemons on a world as their final act of carnage. Once a world has been brought to ruin, the Cultists will slip away and begin the process anew on another planet.
Bellas	Bellas is a Commander in the Sisters of Silence and fought in the Indomitus Crusade, during the Thirteenth Black Crusade, alongside Commander Aphone. After Lord Commander Guilliman ended the Crusade, Bellas was among those forces he led to help aid Ultramar, during the Plague Wars[1a]. Once there, she fought against the Chaos hordes of Nurgle and aided Guilliman in reclaiming Espandor from the Chaos God's grasp.[1b]
Galan Noirgrim	Galan Noirgrim is the Master of the Ordo Malleus, who wrote in the Prelude to The Abominatus that heresy must be destroyed completely at the root of its cause, lest it regrow stronger and doom the Imperium.
Leonid Osma	Leonid Osma was an Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus and a member of the Ordos Helican, which policed the entire Helican Subsector. He was believed to be a shoe-in for becoming Grandmaster of the Ordos Helican, a role which he had spent his whole life chasing, and which he finally attained when Grandmaster Orsini died. He is perhaps best known for his part in the Eisenhorn Conspiracy, a role which eventually led to his death. Osma was a well-built broad-shouldered man, with a blunt and pugnacious face. He lost his lower jaws during a fight with a Khorne Berzerker and had since replaced it with bionics. His weapon is a power hammer, the symbol of his Ordo. In 339.M41, Osma arrested Inquisitor Gregor Eisenhorn of the Ordo Xenos on Cadia on charges of a carta extremis while the latter was on the trail of the Heretic Inquisitor Quixos. Osma declared him Extremis Diabolus and had him imprisoned within the Carnificina. Among the charges against him were daemonancy and committing the Thracian Primaris atrocity. After three months of Eisenhorn being interrogated by Osma's staff, words arrived at the Carnificina that Lord Inquisitor Rorken had persuaded Grandmaster Orsini to have him extradited to Thracian Primaris, where he would stand trial before a Magistery Tribunal of the Ordo Malleus and the Officio of Internal Prosecution. On the night before the Black Ships arrived to take Eisenhorn to Thracian, Eisenhorn's retinue broke him out of the Carnificina, and they fled aboard the Rogue Trader Maxilla's ship, the Essene, whose service Eisenhorn had previously hired. Eisenhorn later cleared his name by tracking down and killing Quixos with the help of five other Inquisitors.
Otto Dagover	Otto Dagover is an Ordo Xenos Inquisitor Lord of the Recongregator faith, who has a great enthusiasm for using Xenos technology. These two interests drove Dagover to answer a plea for aid from Inquisitor Armand Salmenau, after Necron attacked his dig site which had uncovered a Cyranax Watchers weapon. This occurred within Discidia's Vorago Fastness prison complex, which had made its upper society extremely wealthy. However they became decadent and while the world's Tithe was always paid, the ruling elite horded its wealth to themselves. This left most of the world in squalor, but due to the elite's political connections and wealth, Dagover had not been able to move against them. The discovery of the Cyranax weapon changed this and Dagover prepared to reshape the future of Discidia forever. He assembled only a single Kill-Team for the mission, though; largely due to there only being a small Necron force attacking the dig site and the Inquisition's need for Discidia to remain largely unharmed. After assembling the Kill-Team aboard his Battle Cruiser Iudex Ferox, Dagover informed them that their primary objective was the recovery of the Cyranax weapon. They had to ensure it was taken from the unworthy Amalathian Salemenau, who would only destroy the weapon, and also keep it from falling into the Necron's hands. Afterwards Dagover had the Kill-Team teleported within the Vorago Fastness, where they fought their way to Salmeau's dig site. When they arrived, though, Salmenau asked them not to take the Cyranax weapon. He warned that if they did, Dagover's Radicalism would ensure the Kill-Team went down a path that led to Heresy against the Imperium. Salmenau then asked the Kill-Team to disobey Dagover's orders, but they refused and the Inquisitor said they would have to kill him to take the weapon. Seconds later, though, a Necron Lord led another attack on the dig site and the Kill-Team was forced to fire the Cyranax weapon to survive. This played out how Dagover thought it would and the resulting destruction not only wiped out the Necron, but also carved a line of ruin across Discidia's surface. This caused the Vorago Fastness' power source to go down, along with its defenses and blew a hole through one of the prison's walls. This allowed its untold numbers of prisoners to flee into the capital city of Carcera Lucrosus, which housed the Vorago Fastness and the palace of the world's Planetary Governor. The resulting conflict unleashed a civil war on Discidia, the final outcome of which would please Dagover no matter who won. Either way, his creative Recongregator plan had ensured that the world's decadent elite society, had been permanently uprooted for the good of the Imperium. Otto has not received any Rejuvenat treatments and instead wears his centuries and scars as badges of honor. He has however, undergone so many bionic modifications, that the Inquisitor could pass for a member of the Adeptus Mechanicus. Due to the constant hum of servo-motors that accompany him, some wonder how much of Dagover's body still remains, under his ornate black Power Armour. Both of his arms are certainly artificial, as they are longer than a human's, include several additional joints and the Inquisitor's fingers ended in iron-claws. Dagover's eyes have also been replaced with oversized lenses and his teeth have been filed down into fangs.
Godjera Incursion	In 447.M41 the Grey Knights Chapter sent two Brotherhoods, led by Captain Pelega, to halt a tide of Daemonic filth that invaded the Godjera Cluster from an incursion beyond the Jephthati Rift. The followers of the Dark Gods accounted for twelve systems and uncounted billions of dead before the rift was finally sealed.

Sylan Lukasz	Sylan Lukasz is a Lord Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus.
Cult Epicurean	The Cult Epicurean was an infamous Witch Cult[1a] that was active in Farglum System, until they were uncovered on the Hive World Farglum in 085.M41, by Inquisitor Scallen. In order to destroy the Cult, Scallen formed Strike Force Purgation which purged Cult Epicurean's Heretics throughout the System and ended its threat to the Imperium.[1b]
Marcus	Marcus is an Inquisitor of the Ordo Hereticus. He was instrumental in helping to stop the rebellion launched by Varlak, a powerful rogue psyker, on the planet Korsk II.[1a] By chance Marcus was on Korsk II when Varlak used his powers to enrapture the Imperial Guard stationed there and used them to take over the planet. As Varlak declared that Korsk II would secede from the Imperium under his rulership, Marcus fled to Korsk IX and sent an urgent message to the Adeptus Terra to warn them of the psyker's rebellion. Thanks to his message, within days several Space Marine Chapters arrived and put an end to Varlak's plans.[1b]
Pavel Uet	Pavel Uet was an Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus and a comrade of Commodus Voke. Uet's favored pupil was Hetris Lugenbrau, who became an Inquisitor in his own right before he disappeared on Maginor in 239.M41, encountering the forces of the Mystic Path. Lugenbrau's disappearance took a great toll on the Inquisitor, which eventually resulted in his death. It was the effect of Lugenbrau's loss on his friend and colleague that led Commodus Voke to seek vengeance against the one responsible - the corrupted Inquisitor Quixos — over a century later.

Antian Sector	The Antian Sector is a sector of the Galaxy. The Antian Sector was once held by Xenos empires and fallen Human domains, until it was conquered by the Imperium's fleets, which were led by the Imperial Navy Admiral Pator Antias. Disaster struck, though, when after his latest victory in the Sector, Antias' flagship, the Battleship Majestic Light, was struck by a Warp Storm and was lost to to the Imperium. Afterwards, the Admiral was declared an Imperial Saint and became the patron Saint of the sector, which was named the Antian Sector in his honour.[1a] Millennia later, the Sector has known its fare share of horrors and strife, but nothing could prepare the Imperium's worlds there when a catastrophic disaster struck in late M41. Suddenly, without warning, the Daemon Prince Corruptis opened a giant Warp Rift in the centre of the Antian Sector, which signalled the beginning of widespread terror and bloodshed. Now, not only have the forces of Chaos fallen upon the Imperium's worlds in the Sector, but the Eldar, Orks and even the Tyranids have attacked Antian as well.[1b] As the Imperium's forces struggled to beat back their numerous foes, they were dealt a harsher blow when Abaddon the Despoiler himself appeared out of the Warp Rift, at the head of a massive Chaos force. Abaddon had begun planning the start of his Thirteenth Black Crusade and the fall of the Antian Sector will be his first step towards it making it a reality. As the Antian Sector now faces its darkest hour, the Imperium forces fighting there know the only way to save the Sector is to venture into the Warp Rift and defeat the one responsible for its creation: the Daemon Prince Corruptis.[1b]
Loramon Valir	Loramon Valir is an Ordo Xenos Inquisitor who believed that Gorgomire's knightly Order of the Wyrm was in fact a Genestealer Cult in disguise. In order to prove this, Valir and his retinue infiltrated Governor-King, Archimayn XII's Castle Grimheart, to confront his court magister Bargo Xathus. Valir suspected Xathus could lead them to the Order's Patriarch and the Inquisitor and his retinue killed any guards that barred their path. As they journeyed further into the Castle, they killed a Genestealer and found the corrupt dead bodies of the Order, which seemingly showed that the Cult was warring with itself. When they finally neared the court magister's room, however, Valir heard gunfire and raced into the room. He saw another Inquisitor standing over the remains of Xathus. She was Sythra Min of the Ordo Malleus and when Valir told her the magister was his jurisdiction, she then exposed a Chaos symbol on Xathus' body. Thus it was revealed, that there was both a Genestealer and Chaos Cult active on Gorgomire. The two Cults, though, were now at war with each other and Valir and Min decided to work together to destroy them both.
Cortes	Cortes is an Inquisitor in the Ordo Malleus who took part in the Pyrus Reach Conflict[1a], where he was assisted by a Grey Knights task force led by Brother Captain Nicolas Stephanus.
Vult	Vult was a Lord Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus sometime in the 41st Millennium. A strict Amalathian, Vult attempted to oversee the eradication of Horusian ideologies within his order. He eventually rose to the position of Inquisitorial Representative on the Council of the High Lords of Terra. While aiding Inquisitor Covenant in combating a heretical Inquisitor faction known as The Triumvirate, Vult sacrificed himself by holding off a tide of Daemons to allow Covenant and his retinue to escape.

A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Barrero's Peace	Barrero's Peace is a corrupted Bolter that is owned by the Blood Ravens Chapter, though it still resonates with the madness of its former owner, the Heretical Inquisitor Barrero.
Belicor	Belicor is an Ordo Xenos Inquisitor who saved the life of a young Jensus Natorian, before the Psyker boarded the Blackship Psythanatos. The Inquisitor saw the potential within Natorian's physic abilities and personally delivered him to the Blood Ravens, where he became an Aspirant. He oversaw Natorian's tenure in the Chapter, and later in the Inquisitor's career, he instigated the now powerful Librarian's induction into the Deathwatch.
Castiel (Inquisitor)	Castiel is a Radical Horusian Inquisitor, who has recently ordered an entire Imperial Guard Regiment to serve under his command. He has freely described himself as a Radical and Horusian, but those terms have no meaning to the Guardsmen now serving him. They presume Castiel means he bears a religious hatred of the traitorous Warmaster Horus.
Hedrodal	Hedrodal is a Daemonhost who was created by the false prophets of the Pilgrims of Hayte Chaos Cult from the body of the Inquisition Interrogator Cripon, who they had captured. It is a foul thing, and everywhere the Daemonhost passes, there is the sound of nameless things scuttling, and shadows of lurking horrible visages can be seen inhabiting the darkness around it.
Jaueg Dag	Jaueg Dag was an Inquisitor and center of the Gallilenus Heresy. A young and headstrong Thorian Inquisitor, Dag looked to make a great discovery that would elevate the Thorians' knowledge to a greater level. Traveling to Gallilenus III to conduct research, after being refused to study the bodies of Saints and ancient relics on the worlds, Dag's agents instead carried out these activities covertly and the Inquisitor himself began to experiment with the soul and how it relates to the human body. Eventually the Ecclesiarchy caught wind of his forbidden activities, which by this point had devolved into human experimentation. Dag's agents got into a firefight with Imperial authorities. Dag himself soon entered battle against the Sisters of Battle which pursued him, killing several before escaping into the catacombs of Gallilenus. In the aftermath of the incident, Dag was shocked by his own behavior and abandoned his research. Since then, he has become a respected member of the Ordo Hereticus.
Kholoth	Kholoth the Excoriator is a Daemon Prince, who blighted the Imperial Agri World Loressa for sometime. During its invasion of the world, Kholoth killed the population of one of Loressa's villages, save for a six year old boy named Tyrus, who the Daemon began torturing and mutilating. The Daemon Prince's sport with Tyrus was stopped, though, by the appearance of the Ordo Hereticus Inquisitor Covonis, who banished Kholoth back to the Warp. Sometime later, the Daemon Prince possessed the monarchy of the Imperial world Epsilon Regalis, which led it to cross paths with Covonis and Tyrus once again. By that time, the Inquisitor had taken the young child as an apprentice and a reading of the Emperor's Tarot, had drawn them to Epsilon Regalis. This led Covonis to test the purity of the world's monarchy with the Trial by Holy Seal, which revealed they were under the control of a Daemon. The Inquisitor and Tyrus had no idea, however, that the Daemon Prince was behind the possession and when Covonis freed the monarchy from its control, Kholoth was able to enter Realspace. Once freed from the Warp, the Daemon Prince killed Covonis, but it was then defeated by Tyrus, using the Inquisitor's Force Sword.
Recongregationism	Recongregationism is a Radical philosophical faction of the Inquisition. Recongregationists hold that the Imperium, after millennia, has become decadent and corrupt. To remedy this, Recongregators consider that the Imperium should be rebuilt, lest it stagnate further and collapse under the pressure of countless threats from both without and within. The main issue within the Recongregators themselves is if this change to the Imperium should be sudden or gradual. Those who favor slow change might slowly cripple the economic power of ruling elites through sabotaging production of tithed materials or sponsoring internecine strife and vendetta. They might isolate them politically by bribing or blackmailing their political allies, both on- and off-world. A campaign of whispers that paint the established rulers as laughable or indecisive might then open the door for a new set of rulers to be established and supported with the backing of all involved. Meanwhile those Recongregators who favor swift change might plant damning evidence of deep heretical practice among the ruling elite and let the Imperial authority sweep them away.
Covonis	Covonis was a Psyker Ordo Hereticus Inquisitor, who banished the Daemon Prince Kholoth back to the Warp, after it had invaded the Agri World Loressa. Their battle occurred just after the Daemon had slaughtered one of Loressa's village, save for a 6 year old boy named Tyrus, who Kholoth had been torturing. Covonis would take the young Tyrus as his apprentice and teach him the ways of the Ordo Hereticus, as he continued his duties as an Inquisitor. Some time later, a reading of the Emperor's Tarot guided the two of them to Epsilon Regalis and this led Covonis to test the purity of the world's monarchy with the Trial by Holy Seal. The Trial exposed that Epsilon Regalis' monarchy was under the control of a Daemon, but when Covonis freed them from its grasp, this caused the Daemon Prince Kholoth to appear. Kholoth had been behind the monarchy's possession and, once freed into Realspace, the Daemon Prince killed Covonis, but it was then defeated by Tyrus, with the Inquisitor's Force Sword. In the aftermath of Covonis' death, Tyrus took his master's power armour and was later elevated to a full Inquisitor of the Ordo Hereticus.
Rorken	Lord Inquisitor Plebas Alessandro Rorken was the High Inquisitor for the Ordo Xenos in the Helican Subsector as of the 240s.M41, and Gregor Eisenhorn's immediate superior in that sector. In appearance he is well built with a shaven head except for a black goatee and described as being well-muscled.[1a] Although he supports Eisenhorn heavily, he was forced, once, to counter-sign the carta order of Extremis Diabolus on Eisenhorn after he escaped the clutches of the head of the Ordo Malleus Inquisitor Osma on Cadia - a carta also signed by Lord Inquisitor Bezier of the Ordo Malleus. He became severely ill later in his career and was not expected to survive, but did so and continued as the head of the Ordo Xenos for three hundred and fifteen years. He was promoted to Grandmaster Helican after the disappearance of Inquisitor Osma, who by then had ascended to the rank of Grandmaster. At least during his period of time aboard the Saint Scythus Rorken's entourage included four bodyguards clad entirely in golden armour, with masks carved to represent the images of four saints, a henchmen who carried a flamer and its tanks and a flock of Cherubiim.[1a]
Chalan	Chalan was an Inquisitor, who was ambushed and later found dead while conducting an operation based on intelligence thought to have originated from within the ranks of the Ordo Calixis. Worryingly, Chalan was notoriously cautious while on the field, to the degree that it is felt he could only have been drawn out by someone he trusted. This has led many of his fellow Inquisitors to suspect he was killed by a traitor within the Ordo.
Erasmus Crowl	Erasmus Crowl is a veteran Lord Inquisitor of the Ordo Hereticus. Based on Terra, Crowl along with his Interrogator Acolyte Luce Spinoza became entangled in a conspiracy involving the Emperor himself. While investigating a series of ritual murders linked to "The False Angel",[1a] Crowl discovered that a Radical faction of the Inquisition had brought Dark Eldar Haemonculi to Terra to repair the failing Golden Throne. The "False Angel" had in fact been a Imperial Guard veteran attempting to organize a militia to defend Terra's Underhives and was wrongly accused for the murders.[1b] With the aid of the Custodes Navradaran Crowl was able to eventually confront the Dark Eldar, who had since escaped and begun committing ritual killings upon the Throneworld. Crowl was able to track down the Radicals led by Lord Inquisitor Adamara Rassilo and eventually the Xenos itself in the tunnels underneath the Sanctum Imperialis. Though he was initially overcome and tortured by the creature, Navradaran and his brethren were able to slay the xenos while Rassilo was brought to justice by the Custodes.[2a] Afterward Crowl continued to work to uncover the remaining heretics who would dare such an act.[1c]
Kyria Draxus	Kyria Draxus is a Radical Lord Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos, who is one of the Imperium's premier Necron hunters. Kyria Draxus is an audacious Lord Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos who specialises in countering the Necron threat. Draxus is considered a Heretic by some of her peers due to her use of Xenos technology, such as the Eldar shuriken catapult she wields in battle and an armour array which incorporates xenos technologies. She has had decades of contact with the Eldar due to the race's mutual hatred for the Necrons. The aliens helped tutor her in the art of technology and psychic ability.[3b] The Inquisitor Lord is aided by her faithful Wyvach familiar Shang. They possess a deep psychic bond, and it is said that Draxus can see through the eyes of the winged creature. During the Psychic Awakening, the Inquisitor Lord allied with the heretical Battle Sister Ephrael Stern and the Harlequin Kyganil, to combat a rising Necron threat against the Imperium.

Antonius Coil	Antonius Coil was an Ordo Malleus Inquisitor Lord who discovered the location of the Dark Mechanicum Forge World Sarum on the Warp-tainted Imperium world Goleonda IX in 416.M37. After ordering an Exterminatus on Goleonda IX, Antonius gathered a strike force to destroy Sarum and finally end its threat to the Imperium. He assembled a mighty force composed of ships from Battlefleet Reductus, several Militarum Tempestus Regiments, and had aid from the Sons of the Raven, Celestial Guard and Brazen Claws Chapters. However, when Antonius's strike force neared Sarum, it was ambushed by the Warbands of the Warp Ghosts and Black Wings, as well as the Daemon Engines of their Dark Mechanicum allies on Sarum. The Inquisitor Lord was killed in the seventeen hour void war that followed, and only the forces of the Brazen Claws and Celestial Guard were able to escape the strike force's destruction.
Heretic	Within the Imperium of Man, Heresy is any action or opinion which is seen as contrary to the interests of the Imperial regime or its teachings. Due to the theocratic nature of the Imperium Heresy is often a political charge alongside a religious one. In practice, all enemies of the Imperium are invariably labeled Heretics. In the Imperium, the most common sentence for heresy is death. Heresy within the Imperium may take many forms. These include deviations from the established Imperial Cult, to denying the rights and rule of the Adeptus Terra, to collaboration or association with Xenos and Mutants, to open dissent or rebellion. The most serious acts of Heresy are reserved for those who associate with the Dark Gods of Chaos. Formal declarations of Heresy or of Heretics can come from a variety of sources, but the most common is that of the Ecclesiarchy. Nonetheless, often the accusation of Heresy in the Imperium used as a weapon by those wishing to gain power over others. Moreover, as the Imperium is a vast realm with countless different cultures and traditions, what is considered Heretical to one world may be perfectly acceptable to another. This makes the persecution of Heresy a delicate affair. The act of simply defying the Imperium or its Adepta is often decried as Heresy. Rebellion in the Imperium can take many forms, from a desire to free oneself from the Imperial yoke to conversion to Chaos. While often all types of rebels are branded heretics, wiser and more experienced Inquisitors are able to discern legitimate greivances from malicious corruption and avoid unnecessary purges.
Byphon	Byphon is an Inquisitor of the Askellon Sector, who is known to have argued with Inquisitor Merrinus, about which of the Ordos is most important to the safety of the Imperium.
Galaxia Daemonica Perpetua of Jerome	The Galaxia Daemonica Perpetua of Jerome is an Inquisition text on the Eye of Terror.
Cynole	Cynole is an Inquisitor, who is being led by Doctor Moenkhaus to an area he needs to investigate, which is twenty miles from a forest logging site. They are using an aerial 'thopter to travel there, as Moenkhaus claims the area is impassable overland to reach. The Doctor's usage of the term "impassable", however, was noticed by the Inquisitor. Cynole believes that for Moenkhaus to so readily dismiss possibilities, means the Doctor was either a fool or was trying to conceal something.
Space Marine Captain	A Captain leads from the front. By his example shall his men know what it is to be of the Adeptus Astartes, and from his teachings shall they learn the trade of battle in the Emperor's name. No ordinary man can a Captain be, for many are the paths to victory and he must be master of them all. His very being shall be an extension of the Emperor's work. With every strike of his sword, with every word of his speech, does he reaffirm the ideals of our honoured master. He will vanquish darkness and heresy with every thought, word, and deed. So shall his coming be a sign of deliverance to the dutiful, and a herald of dismay to all traitors. No living man shall stay his wrath. A Space Marine 'Captain' (also known as Brother-Captain, or Company Captain[2b]) is a Senior rank within a Space marine Chapter. They typically commands an entire Company of his battle brothers (a customary maximum of one hundred Marines).[2a]
Inquisitor Ascendant (Graphic Novel Series)	Inquisitor Ascendant is a series of graphic novels. The first volume tells how Inquisitor Defay and his pupil Gravier investigate the recent Chaos infestation upon the planet Nicodemus. The second volume, The Hunt for Defay, tells how Gravier, on the orders of Inquisitor Reiker, tracks down his former master. The trail is difficult to follow and not everything is as it seems.
Xavier Mendoza	Xavier Mendoza is known as one of the most notorious Inquisitors in the history of the Imperium. He was a fanatical enemy of Chaos and Mendoza quashed it wherever he believed it to be found. Shortly after the Horus Heresy he became convinced that all Space Marines were servants of the Chaos Gods and began a Holy War to destroy any remaining loyal Adeptus Astartes. His actions came to a head when the Inquisitor boarded a cruiser of the newly formed Black Templars chapter and accused its crew of harboring daemons. He then declared them heretics and after a short trial, Mendoza had fifty Black Templars burned at the stake. Soon afterwards, though, the Inquisitor was found dead and some think that Mendoza was possibly assassinated.
Space Hulk	A space hulk, also referred to a macro-agglomeration, is a massive conglomeration of lost ships and wrecks fused together. They drift through space and in and out of the warp and during the millennia the lost ships join together into one enormous body. Frequently, they are so huge that they have their own atmosphere and gravity. Since the hulks often exit and re-enter the warp seemingly at random, searching or traveling in them is dangerous in the extreme. The Imperial Navy, and all Imperial forces and authorities as a whole, have standard orders to survey such objects and to report their location. The hulks consist of ships and items of technology millennia old and the recoverable technology can be of immense value to the Imperium, and especially to the Adeptus Mechanicus, thus elite Imperial forces are sent aboard to clear out infestations. Depending on the strategic situation (availability of troops, proximity to vital Imperial star systems, safety margins, etc), Space Marines are sent to purge the hulk of any alien infestations. These supermassive accretions of wrecked void-craft are inconstant, erupting into and out of realspace without warning on misfiring warp engines. Centuries can go by between sightings of documented hulks, often appearing far from where they were last encountered. But whenever they appeared, the doctrine for probing a hulk was well established. The first and most essential duty of any Mechanicus expedition was to render all warp engines inert, locking the entire assemblage in place and putting an end to its nomadic, rampaging odyssey.
Erasmus Cartavolnus	Erasmus Cartavolnus is a zealous Ordo Malleus Inquisitor Psyker. Over 300 years old, Cartavolnus has devoted his long life to the study of all that is unholy. A Puritan, he condemns the use of Daemonhosts and Chaos artifacts even for fighting Chaos. Despite this, he himself maintains a library of arcane lore and specializes in rituals binding the daemonic. Cartavolnus believes himself pure from the heresies and corruption that has befallen his Radical counterparts, maintaining strict discipline that the use of his dark lore only be used for holy purposes. During the battle on Agrofar against a mutated Chaos Sorcerer of Nurgle known as Grolgafax, Cartavolnus lost an arm slaying the foul creature. It took years for the Inquisitor to fully free his limb from lingering rot and chaos taint. Like many Inquisitors, Cratavolnus maintains ties with others of his order. He is a Reclamator-Emeritus of the Dzijeni Conclave, which operates in the Nachmund Sector as well as a Magister of the Khandar Brotherhood and a representative of the Vorkhan Defenders. Some of his titles are more esoteric, with the Mercantile Leagues of Deverres honoring him as the Three-Eyed. After the formation of the Great Rift, Cartavolnus saw combating its expansion and corruption as his holy duty. To that end he has deployed to the Vigilus warzone in an effort to topple Blackstone constructs magnifying the Warp known as Noctilith Crowns. At Nemendghast, the Inquisitor infiltrated the surface and uncovered the Noctilith Crown erected by a Black Legion Master of Possession. Realizing these foes were beyond his means to destroy, he contacted the Ultramarines and requested aid. At Hive Mortwald, Cartavolnus only narrowly escaped from the Black Legion Sorcerer Xagramothis due to the intervention of Saint Celestine.[3c]
Jazad D'ontor	Jazad D'ontor was an Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos. D'ontor was active during the Age of the Dark Imperium (though he was quite elderly by this point). Some time after the Great Rift's creation, he sent a message to Watch Commander Agathon of Mortguard, revealing that the T'au had invaded the Chalnath Expanse and detailing those worlds that he believed were the primary focusses of the xenos: the planets Cestis and Saint's Halt, along with the worlds of the Arrajian System. The Inquisitor requested the aid of the Deathwatch, concluding that Kar Duniash would be the next target for the T'au if the Expanse fell.
Black Rage	The Black Rage, also known as the Flaw of Sanguinius, is one of the two Gene-Seed flaws of the Blood Angels and their Successor Chapters, the other being the Red Thirst. All of the Chapters derived from the Blood Angels still suffer from the psychic imprint left by Sanguinius's death. This can cause them to go insane prior to or during a battle, and they believe that they are Sanguinius himself during the Battle of Terra. The condition is irrevocable (except for one case, Chaplain Lemartes, who is largely able to control it), and victims are locked away in the "Tower of the Lost" on the Blood Angels' homeworld until they finally die. This insanity is known as the Black Rage. When a Space Marine is overcome by the Black Rage he is reborn in a world of anger, hatred, fury and nothing else. As well as Sanguinius’s memories, the Blood Angel is touched with a small portion of his unearthly power, boosting his strength and vitality to superhuman levels. Rather than face a slow, insane death, Blood Angels will form those who have newly succumbed to the Black Rage into a special unit known as the Death Company. They paint their armour black, daubed with red crosses, signifying the wounds of Sanguinius, and are usually led by the few Chapter officers, notably Death Company Chaplains, who are able to communicate orders to these lost warriors. They are then sent out to perform the most dangerous assaults, hoping for a quick and honourable death in combat.

Laurentix	Laurentix is the fifth world of the Belis Corona System. During one of its tours of the Cadian Gate, the Bell of Saint Gerstahl was on Laurentix with its vanguard of fifty Order of Our Martyred Lady Adepta Sororitas, when the holy relic tolled a dozen times. No one had touched the Bell to cause this to happen and the world's population wailed in ecstasy in response to the miracle. However the tolling signified that a Black Crusade had begun and this was proven correct shortly afterwards, when the Black Legion invaded Laurentix as part of the opening raids of the 12th Black Crusade. As fighting engulfed the world, the Bell of Saint Gerstahl was targeted by the invaders, but the Order of Our Martyred Lady vanguard had sworn to die in its defense, rather than surrender the holy relic. Though the Adepta Sororitas's lives would end at the Black Legion's hands, the Bell somehow disappeared during the fighting, before the Chaos Space Marines could claim it. While the Imperium believed the holy relic ascended to avoid being captured, in truth it had been stolen by the Necron Overlord Trazyn the Infinite. It was while the Bell's vanguard fought a last stand to defend it, that the Overlord placed the relic in Stasis and escaped with his prize. Trazyn then stored the holy relic among his collections of things on Solemnace.
D'anloxtos	D'anloxtos was a radical Inquisitor, whose insane machinations were ended by a band of the Adeptus Custodes known as the Gilded Fist.
Draven	Draven is a Necron Tomb World. It is part of the Novokh Dynasty.
Excommunicate Traitoris	Excommunicate Traitoris is the designation applied to Imperial individuals or groups, including Space Marine Legions, Knight Houses or radical Inquisitors, that have betrayed the Imperium through heresy, mutation or any other act the Imperium deems unforgivable. Several Space Marine forces have been deemed Excommunicate, such as the Traitor Legions, the Flame Falcons, the Relictors, and the Soul Drinkers. Such Chapters frequently become Renegade Space Marines.[Needs Citation] This article needs work on its citations.For help on citation see the citation guidelines. You can help Lexicanum by fixing it.
Flames of Damnation (Comic Anthology)	Flames of Damnation is a comic anthology; an collection of 28 comics. ISBN 1-84416-253-2 Most of these comics either appeared inside of Eternal War (Comic Anthology) or in Eternal Damnation (Comic Anthology). The main difference is the size: the two smaller volumes are bigger, while this edition is roughly pocket-sized. The stories/comics are the following:
Falchat	Falchat was a Hive World of the Imperium. In 992.M41, Inquisitor Bastapol Harg brought doom to Falchat after he destroyed a Khornate Cult responsible for a series of murders. What the Inquisitor did not know was that the Cult paid fealty to the Bloodgorged Warband and they soon fell upon Falchat with a vengeance. In the bloodbath that followed, the Bloodgorged slaughtered the Inquisitor and anyone else they could find in Falchat's Hives.
Angron's Monolith (Novella)	Angron's Monolith is a novella by Steve Lyons, published online in August 2014.

Lakonia Persecution	The Lakonia Persecution was the name given to the Imperial mission to track, capture and contain the Renegade Space Marines of the Soul Drinkers Chapter.[1e] At one point in M41, a Soul Drinkers taskforce led by Commander Caeon took part in an Administratum-orchestrated raid on the Van Skorvold Star Fort in the Lakonia System. Although the official reason for the raid was to sanction the Van Skorvold Cartel, the members of which were suspected of a number of crimes against the Imperium, the Soul Drinkers were acting on intelligence that the Van Skorvolds had come into possession of a lost relic of the Chapter - a legendary weapon known as the Soulspear.[1a][1b] In the assault on the star fort, Caeon was killed by Veritas Van Skorvold and was succeeded as Commander of the strike force by Librarian Sarpedon. Despite this, the Soul Drinkers were able to locate the Soulspear in the cartel's vaults. As they moved to secure it, however, the weapon was stolen by the Chapter's Adeptus Mechanicus allies operating under the orders of Archmagos Khobotov.[1b] The Soul Drinkers threatened retribution against the Imperial battlefleet supporting them in an effort to get the Mechanicus to relinquish the Soulspear, but Khobotov then deployed a Geryon Ordinatus platform from his ship capable of destroying the star fort if the Space Marines did not stand down.[1c] The Soul Drinkers instead launched an assault on the Geryon, destroying it and crippling the battlefleet.[1d]
Suresya	Suresya, known as the Foresaken, is a Radical Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus. A veteran Daemon Hunter and long-serving member of the Scholariate at Arms, Inquisitor Suresya espouses the Xanthite philosophy, even going so far as to openly wield a known daemon weapon called Kherez'phyr. Suresya’s methods have earned him the condemnation of dozens of fellow Inquisitors, especially Puritans, but so far he has avoided formal censure. This is largely because his methods have always proven highly successful, but also due to the governing principles of the Scholariate at Arms, which enforce an uneasy truce between peers with widely divergent beliefs. Suresya has been instrumental in purging many widespread conspiracies and cults, and has halted several potentially devastating daemonic incursions. He maintains a small, but highly competent, household that includes dozens of oathbound Banishers and Tech-Priests, as well as a large cohort of warded gun-servitors. Suresya rarely undertakes missions alongside other Inquisitors, although he will cooperate in the early stages of an investigation if circumstances dictate. However, the final execution of any mission is always undertaken exclusively by Suresya and his followers. None outside of his household have ever witnessed the methods he uses to such great effect in the banishment of the enemies of Mankind. The true reason that Suresya refuses to work alongside other Inquisitors is that he is not a Xanthite at all. He is in fact a member of a splinter faction of the Xanthites known as the Phaenonites. These individuals are rare indeed, for their philosophies have caused them to be outlawed the length and breadth of the Imperium. The faction was thought wiped out long ago, but has recently reappeared in the Calixis Sector. The faction takes the philosophy of the Xanthites — that Chaos can be used against Chaos — to such an extreme that even their fellow Radical Inquisitors often believe them to have crossed a line. The Phaenonites believe that the Warp and technology can be fused to create an ultimate weapon, which they are fated to wield. But what truly sets them apart from even the most radical of Xanthites is that they believe that anyone who follows a god — whether that god is a Ruinous Power or the Emperor himself — is nothing but a deluded fool. They denounce the worship of all gods and believe themselves the true ultimate power in the universe. It is through their mastery of Warp-technology — known to the Adeptus Mechanicus as “Maletek” — that the Phaenonites hope to become far greater than the gods themselves.
Daemonhost	A Daemonhost is a living mortal body used as a receptacle to bind a daemon, differing from a possessee in that the daemon does not possess or control the mortal, but is bound into it. The Daemonhost is used by another mortal, often in order to use Chaos to fight Chaos. Being an entity of the warp, a daemon cannot manifest itself in real space under normal circumstances. A daemon may instead enter the mind of a vulnerable psyker and turn the individual to its will and, through its host, affect reality. Outside of natural circumstances, and outside the Eye of Terror, daemons can exist temporarily in real space by being summoned through complex rituals. The source of such psychically attuned bodies varies. Chaos Cultists will often sacrifice themselves for "the good of the cause" so their patron daemon can lead them personally. Other times an end-justifies-the-means type Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus will sacrifice inconsequential individuals so that they can bring forth a daemon that can be interrogated for information on Chaos. Or even more diabolically, they create daemonhosts to fight other daemonic creatures. The creation of a daemonhost is considered heresy, and is enough for an Inquisitor to be declared excommunicate.[2a]
Codex Imperialis (Background Book)	Codex Imperialis is the companion book to the Warhammer 40,000 2nd Edition Rulebook, published for the first time in 1993 as part of the 2nd Edition boxed set of Warhammer 40,000. The book has 96 pages and the cover is printed in colour while the book remains in black and white. This book contains shortened army lists for using Space Marine, Imperial Guard, Eldar, Ork, Squat, Chaos and Tyranid armies. Furthermore it also includes rules for fielding various branches of the forces of the Imperium. This book contains background information and fiction on every Warhammer 40k race created up to 1993.
Erya Nephthys	Erya Nephthys was once the most promising Inquisitor of her generation, who went renegade and became a symbol of infamy in the Calixis Sector, after she massacred a number of her peers in the very heart of the Tricorn Palace, on the planet Scintilla. During her career among the monodominant faction, her multiple, major wounds have driven her insane. After having lost an arm on Sinophia against a demon, being resurrected twice then spending a full year recovering from her terrible last mission on the deadly world of Dusk, her strife for her own survival grew to the point she became obsessed with her own death, and her quest for immortality. She focused her hunt for heresy on necro-cults and heretek vivisectors, to steal from them theirs secrets, becoming a potent sorceress herself despite her puritanism. Until she raided the Hypocrasian Agglomeration Genators, sparking a schism between the Mechanicus and the Holy Ordos that threatened outright conflict. Summoned by Inquisitor Lord Caidin to explain her actions, she came only to steal several artefacts from the deep vaults of the Tricorn Palace, slaying several Inquisitors and their Acolytes with sorceries and forbidden science in the process.
Formosa Sector	The Formosa Sector is an Imperial sector, neighbouring the Vidar Sector[1a] in the Eastern Fringe.[7a] Even thousands of years before the opening of the Great Rift, the sector was bedevilled by malign phenomena. Many Navigators have noted that the light of the Astronomican flickered in the Formosa Sector. To make matters worse, the sector is infested with Chaos Cults.[7a] For many millennia, a remarkable number of of Psykers have emerged in the Formosa Sector, many of whom were capable of predicting the future. Over the years, the prophesies of the Formosan Seers were collated, written down and stored in the libraries of Promulgatia, formerly the sector's foremost Cardinal World. Eventually, however, the Grey Knights intervened; in the aftermath of the War of Threnodies they quarantined not just Promulgatia, but its entire system. Ever since, the Grey Knights have maintained a presence in the Formosa Sector, watching over Promulgatia and a number of other locations of interest.[7a]
The Full Account of the Failed Heresy of Pamphylia Majoris and its Peoples Most Wicked	The Full Account of the Failed Heresy of Pamphylia Majoris and its Peoples Most Wicked is an Imperial text, compiled by Inquisitor Uphazin Dibri. The text contains details of the career and exploits of Canoness Preceptor Sabathine Gizella of the Order of the Bleeding Heart (although, unlike other some other texts about the Canoness, access to The Full Account is restricted).
Horosa Barnabas	Inquisitor Horosa Barnabas was always fond of bold gestures and cut an impressive figure to the masses, very much fulfilling the most common conceptions of what an Inquisitor should be. His sweeping pogroms were always a terror among the noble classes, and that gave him a good deal of popularity with the workers. However, not all of his exploits over four centuries of service reflect well on him. The current generations of servants in the Tower of Brass, for example, are mainly descended from the Family Longsorrow, former prisoners trapped in bureaucratic limbo once they were exonerated by evidence uncovered after his death. Another mark against him was the trail of lost artefacts and botched missions that followed him and his retinue. They were so dismal and persistent that some suspected a cunningly-hidden secret agenda was being played out. If so, it was being done beneath the very noses of the Ordo Xenos and surely with the collusion of many of their most highly placed members. In truth, evidence has come to light that Inquisitor Barnabas was under some kind of alien influence, at least during the latter parts of his career. Those who know of this can do little with the information, for Barnabas was killed by the Eldar on the planet Andronicus. Soon after his death, the majority of Barnabas's contributions to the Ordo's knowledge were sealed away on Watch Fortress Erioch, inside quarantine zones allegedly too dangerous and toxic to approach.
Kirs Drova	Kirs Drova is a ruthless Ordo Xenos Inquisitor, who is active in the Nachmund Gauntlet. During her time there, Drova requested the Wrathhost Chapter's forces serving in the Wardens of the Gauntlet to cleanse the pirate haven of the Stones of Cavadi. The human and xenos pirates there had been preying upon nearby Imperial worlds and shipping lanes for some time, only drawing Drova's ire after they plundered a ship belonging to her valued agents. The Inquisitor and the Wrathhost both thought it would be an easy campaign, as they did not believe the numerous pirate groups within the asteroid field would defend each other. They were soon proven wrong, as the pirates worked together surprisingly well to fight the Chapter and a drawn out battle commenced. After the Wrathhost's fleet began to suffer losses, Drova was forced to call in the Imperial Navy for assistance in blockading the Stones of Cavadi. This prevented the pirates from leaving the asteroid field to escape the Chapter's fleet and the Wrathhost began making headway. Eventually the Stones were cleansed by the Chapter and Naval Armsmen, which left hordes of resources in Drova's hands. Not only did she take hundreds of prisoners, along with strongholds containing equipment and esoteric artefacts, the Inquisitor would also imprison the T'au Water Caste envoy who had been secretly leading the pirates.
Ghankus Dhar	Ghankus Dhar is an Inquisitor Lord of the Ordo Malleus. Lord Dhar has served as the Proctor of the Scholariate at Arms for almost three decades, guiding his Chamber through a number of major incursions and saving the sector from several full-scale Warp breaches. He is devoted to his Ordo, and has defeated several attempts by rivals to oust him from his position. Several of these rivals claimed that by serving as a Master in Council he was undermining the legitimacy of individual Inquisitors, who had no need to recognize any authority but that of the High Lords. In response, Dhar confronted the disaffected Inquisitors, defeated the ringleaders in battle, and expelled the remainder from the Calixis Sector. Dhar operates within a structure established centuries ago by the mutual consent of the majority of Ordo Malleus Inquisitors in the Calixis Sector, and has no intention of stepping down or dismantling a structure that has seen the Ordo through hundreds of turbulent years. Lord Dhar is a craggy, weather-beaten man with skin the texture of old leather. It is not known whether he has ever undergone rejuv-treatment, but if he has, it was out of devotion to duty rather than vanity, for his face bears the lines and scars of many centuries of service. When called upon to take to the field, Lord Dhar wears a suit of mighty terminator armour, the surface of which resembles black marble shot through with crimson veins. It is said that when Lord Dhar dons his blank-faced marble helmet, he takes on the aspect of an immovable mountain or a titanic statue, standing unbowed as wave after wave of daemons crash against him. Lord Dhar carries a Daemon Hammer of great power and obscure pedigree. This weapon is at once both the sign of his status within the Ordo Malleus and a tool by which the infernal enemies of Mankind are banished. The weapon is called formally the “Hammer of Promeus”, but has also been called “Fiend-Hewer”, “Warp-Crusher”, and “Mason’s Hand”. When presiding over the Chamber of the Scholariate at Arms, Dhar keeps his hammer at his side. It has become symbolic of both a judge’s gavel and an executioner’s tool. It is said that this hammer was passed down to Lord Dhar, from generation after generation of predecessors, and that it predates by millennia the foundation of the Calixis Sector. Some have said that the weapon belonged to one of the very first Inquisitors, in particular one who was instrumental in laying the foundations of the Ordo Malleus. The truth about the hammer’s history, however, has been lost to time.

Antor Delassio	Antor Delassio (The Cursed Young Prince)[1b] is a member of the Deathwatch. Hailing from the Blood Angels Chapter, Delassio is a Assault Marine Sergeant. However, he harbors a dark secret - that of the Black Rage that afflicts him. As such, he is prone to berserker rages in battle.[1a] Delassio was given the honour of signing up for an indefinite tour of service with the Deathwatch by Chapter Master Dante personally, becoming one of the few Blood Angels at the time to be welcomed by the Chapter.

Titus Drake	Titus Drake was an Inquisitor.
Ghosar Quintus	Ghosar Quintus is a world of the Imperium.[1b] Ruled by the Trysst Dynasty for several centuries, in 680.M41 a major Genestealer Cult of the Four-Armed Emperor infestation was discovered by Inquisitor Chaegryn upon the world. It was discovered that the Trysst Dynasty had come under the control of a Genestealer Patriarch (this Genestealer got to the planet cowered in a piece of a fragment that broke away from the Curse of Unreason Space Hulk that fell on the planet at the beginning of M40), and the family was purged by a Deathwatch Kill-Team led by Ortan Cassius in the first major Imperial encounter with Genestealer Cults.[1b] Investigating what appeared to be a perversion of the Imperial Creed, Inquisitor Chaegryn led a team of Tempestus Scions to Ghosar Quintus and ventured into the depths of the Great Pit. The deeper Chaegryn ventured, the more evidence of deviance he found. Strangely, his last communique stated that all was well, and that the Trysst Dynasty should be left to its own devices. It was a full year before Chaegryn’s fellows noticed that something was deeply wrong. A five-man Kill Team of Deathwatch Space Marines (Kill Team Excis) was sent on a follow-up mission of lethal investigation, yet they too were swallowed by the mysteries of the Great Pit and hadn't survived the initial ambush. Only when Chaplain Cassius mustered his own hand-picked Kill Team was the vile truth unearthed – Ghosar Quintus was home to a xenos infestation.
Celaeno (Inquisitor)	Celaeno was an Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus who clashed with the Night Reapers Warband in 999.M41. The Inquisitor and a Company of the Red Hunters brought the Warband to battle on the barren worlds of the Calligulan Nebula, where the Chapter's vehicles fought the Night Reapers' Daemon Engines. The Warband was victorious in the battle, however, as the Inquisitor was killed by an errant shell fired by the Red Hunter's vehicles, and the Night Reapers eventually forced the Space Marines to retreat.

Uphazin Dibri	Uphazin Dibri is an Inquisitor, who collated The Full Account of the Failed Heresy of Pamphylia Majoris and its Peoples Most Wicked text. It notably contains details as to the exploits of the renowned Order of the Bleeding Heart Canoness Preceptor Sabathine Gizella, during the conflict on Pamphylia Majoris.
De Marche	De Marche was a Radical Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus and follower of the Xanthite cause.[1c] De Marche assisted the Space Marines of the Fire Claws Chapter in an operation to cleanse the Space Hulk Captor of Sin when it was used by a Chaos Space Marine warband to attack the Stygies System. The Fire Claws strike force, led by Epistolary Decario, boarded the Hulk and initially made good progress with Terminator Assault Squads overwhelming the Chaos Marines in several actions. All of that changed, however, when the Fire Claws reached the main enginarium, where they engaged the warband's leader, a Champion of Tzeentch known as the Excoriator.[1a] In the battle against the Excoriator, several Space Marines were killed and Decario was wounded. In desperation, Decario reached for the nearest weapon available and used it to decapitate the Excoriator, only to discover that the weapon he had wielded was the Chaos Champion's own daemon sword. Weathering a mental assault from the daemon trapped within the blade, de Marche assisted the Librarian and was able to get him to drop the sword. Decario threw himself at de Marche's mercy, only for the Inquisitor to reveal that he was a Xanthite - a follower of a Radical philosophy that posited that tools of Chaos could be used against Chaos itself. De Marche proceeded to absolve Decario of any sin as, in his eyes, defeating the Excoriator was the Emperor's will.[1a]
Exterminatus Issue 8	Exterminatus was a Fanatic Press Magazine dedicated to the game Inquisitor. It was dedicated to presenting new releases, rules for games and models, and painting guides.
Appolus Bourgery	Appolus Bourgery is an Ordo Chronos Inquisitor, as well as a powerful Psyker. However, the overuse of his powers have left Appolus a wizened old man, who must be carried by members of his retinue. In order to remedy this, the Inquisitor now seeks to travel back in time, in order to hijack his younger body. Until then, Appolus makes use of his mind-wiped retinue by psychically controlling their bodies, much like Inquisitor Ravenor. The wizened Inquisitor Appolus Bourgery, being carried by one of his Acolytes...
Emil Darkhammer	Emil Darkhammer is a Puritan Monodominant Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos and the arch-enemy of Radical Inquisitor Helynna Valeria. A strict Monodominant, Darkhammer views all alien technology as an affront and threat to humanity. In pursuance of his extreme creed of purity that goes with his Monodominant philosophy, Darkhammer has enacted Exterminatus on over thirty worlds. Sometimes this has been to end wars, corruption, or plague, but also sometimes to destroy a mere handful of insurgents or aliens or obliterate a single Warp-tainted artifact sought after by his Radical colleague, Valeria. His actions have polarized the Inquisition, with some viewing him as a beacon of righteousness while others see him as only slightly less destructive than the Daemons of the Warp. Only on a few occasions has Darkhammer stayed his hand, most notably after the First War of Armageddon. There, he commuted an Exterminatus order to a program of mass-execution and mind-wipe, largely because he feared retaliation from the nearby Space Wolves. More recently, Darkhammer has become determined to stop his nemesis Helynna Valeria from uncovering the Xenos artifact known as the Dimensional Forge, a device capable of creating a null zone light years in diameter that Daemons could not penetrate. Darkhammer would issue an Exterminatus order to the Hive World of Cavlock after he discovered Valeria suspected the Dimensional Forge was hidden there. Using the pretext of preventing a Daemonic incursion from spreading, Darkhammer condemned billions to death in order to foil Valeria. Valeria has since declared Darkhammer Excommunicate Traitoris and has hunted him across Segmentum Obscurus to seek revenge for the destruction of the Dimensional Forge.[1a]
Raphael Dante	Raphael Dante is a Radical Inquisitor, believed by many to be a tainted Xanthite, who has allowed followers of Chaos to serve in his retinue. He is also known to possess esoteric and dubious wargear, among them the severed heads of Chaos Mutants.[1b]
Unholy Harbinger	The Unholy Harbinger was a Space Hulk. The Hulk was present in the Cloras System in late M39, with the Imperial Navy vessel Indomitable Presence assigned to survey it. Inquisitor Daska led an expedition in boarding the Harbinger. Deep within the Hulk, the survey team found what they initially thought was a very dense asteroid but on closer examination was a mass of unidentifiable metal. Although the substance defied augur analysis, the Indomitable Presence's database contained a report of a similar substance found in an alien ruin on Tamar IV. Daska was able to access further reports that led him to restrict access to the Hulk while he conducted experiments on the mass. After some time, Daska reactivated power generators aboard the Unholy Harbinger to supply the metal mass with energy. The metal started to expand and reform into a platform holding a portal from which emerged metal monsters that slaughtered the Inquisitor's party. Captain Felstorm was forced to destroy the Harbinger, launching salvo after salvo of torpedoes from the Indomitable Presence until the Hulk was reduced to wreckage strewn about the system.
Torquemada Coteaz	"There are those amongst our Ordo who say that I seek advancement for my own purposes, and they are correct. My purpose is to destroy the daemonic and if I must rise to command an entire sector to do so, then so be it. I am a servant of the Emperor and only those who consort with Warp-spawn need fear my ambition."- Inquisitor Lord Coteaz.[8a] Torquemada Coteaz, also known as the High Protector of the Formosa Sector, is an Inquisitor Lord of the Ordo Malleus. Coteaz was born in an Ecclesiarchy facility with his mother, father, brother, and sisters. However when he was ten the Chapel Master of their church granted mercy to a group of idolators, which proved to be a severe mistake when these heretics used their reprieve to instead organize a new coup. They captured the members of the congregation, including Coteaz's whole family, and sacrificed them to the Ruinous Powers. Coteaz was only saved due to the intervention of the Inquisition under a Lord Inquisitor Laredian. Coteaz was spared from execution by the vengeful Inquisition because of the faith and determination he displayed to the Inquisitorial Stormtroopers. The incident came to teach Coteaz the lesson that mercy and tolerance were the forebearers of Heresy.[7a]
Damne	Damne was an Inquisitor active in M34. Damne was notably critical of the rituals practiced by the Blood Angels Chapter, which the Inquisitor believed had weakened their gene-seed.
Gallilenus Heresy	The Gallilenus Heresy is a scandalous incident involving the Inquisition which centered around the actions of Inquisitor Jaueg Dag on the Cardinal World of Gallilenus III. The planet is roughly four hundred light years away from Holy Terra and is the most visited place by pilgrims who are travelling to the Imperial Palace. It is considered one of the oldest worlds to have been incorporated into the Ministorum and boasts not only huge palaces and cathedrals but also extensive catacombs of ancient tombs as well as vast reliquaries. The bodies, or even parts of them, of several saints are believed to reside within them and are guarded by a detachment of Battle Sisters. Due to its nature, the planet is often visited by Inquisitors who subscribe to the Thorian belief and it was the actions of one of these that led to a rift between the Inquisition and the Ecclesiarchy which has yet to be closed. Jaeueg Dag was a young and headstrong Inquisitor who sought to forward the Thorian cause and eager enough to the point that he was not content to merely study the texts of his predecessors but instead sought to make a great discovery that would heighten the Thorians' knowledge to a greater level. Whilst he knew of the great many works near Dimmamar and Ophelia, he instead sought to perform research on Gallilenus III. In the past, several Inquisitors of the Thorian philosophy requested permission to study the saint's remains which involved them being exhumed for examination but the rulers of Gallilenus refused. Rather than force the issue, the Inquisitors relented and wisely took their studies elsewhere. Inquisitor Dag instead chose to conduct his studies in a covert manner and did not inform the ruling Cardinals of his secret investigations or his presence on their world.
Tytrona Dikaisune	Tytrona Dikaisune is an Inquisitor and is among the few that are stranded within the Gilead System, due to the Great Rift's creation. Though the Rogue Trader Jakel Varonius has been given guardianship of the Gilead System, Tytrona has made it clear that she has absolute authority wherever the taint of Chaos emerges.[1a] It is not clear what Ordo Tytrona belongs to, as different pages of the Wrath & Glory Core Rulebook - Revised Edition describe her as either being a Malleus[1a] or Hereticus Inquisitor.[1c] Inquisitor Dikaisune becomes involved in the fate of the Radical Interrogator Prodita Mendax, when she attempts to claim the Xenos device known as the Revelator:
Gastor Desvalle	Gastor Desvalle was a renowned Ordo Hereticus Inquisitor Lord who led countless crusades into Chaos-corrupted war zones and banished many monstrous entities. So successful was he that the Inquisitor made a great deal of enemies beyond the veil and was compelled to requisition a singularly powerful personal force field to protect him from Warp-spawned attackers. This became known as Desvalle's Holy Circle and, after the Inquisitor Lord's death, it became a relic of the Ecclesiarchy.
Conclave of Progress	The Conclave of Progress is a League of the Leagues of Votann. Its territory lies close to Ingenisus, the Homeworld of the Ingeniators Chapter. However the Ingeniators and the Imperium tolerate the Conclave's presence to some degree, due to the trade the League conducts with Imperial worlds. As a result of this, the Chapter will sometimes allow its forces to accompany and fight beside those of the Conclave of Progress. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Black Library of Chaos	The Black Library of Chaos (also known as just the Black Library) is the Eldar's repository of forbidden lore. The Craftworlds became the only surviving sources of their ancient knowledge after the Fall of the Eldar. As the Craftworlds have drifted apart, this knowledge has consequently become fragmented, and as some Craftworlds have become lost over the millennia, more knowledge has been lost with them. The Library is the only source of the Eldar's knowledge concerning Chaos that has remained untouched. It was created by Cegorach (better known as the Laughing God), though for what purposes can only be guessed. As such, the Black Library is guarded by Harlequins such as those of the Masque of the Falling Moon. Though most often mentioned in relation to its collection of chaotic lore, the Library contains other mysteries as well. It is said that knowledge of the fate of Arhra, the fallen Phoenix Lord, is contained within the vast archives of the Black Library, as is the nature of ancient "star gods" and more besides.[5b]
Hyronimus Drake	Hyronimus Drake was an Inquisitor of the Imperium during the time of the Macharian Crusade.[1a] Accompanying Lord Solar Macharius during the latter part of the Crusade, Drake saw one of his primary missions as monitoring Macharius himself for any signs of corruption.[1a] During the conflict on Karsk IV, he aided Macharius in defeating a monstrous Lord of Change by using his expertise to close a Warp portal. He continued to accompany Macharius on the Crusade, aiding him in the struggle for control of the Fist of Demetrius on Demetrius and Procrastes. During the war on Loki against the traitorous general Richter, Drake alongside Logan Grimnar slew the heretic.[1b] However, he may have been also feeding the traitors intelligence in order to deliberately stall the war effort as part of his unknown ends.[1c]
Morgan	Morgan was a Master in the Dark Angels Chapter, who teleported aboard a Space Hulk with a squadron of his Battle Brothers, alongside the Ordo Malleus Inquisitor Dragos and the Grey Knights under his command, to search the Hulk before it was destroyed in a collision with a nearby planet. Once aboard Dragos warned Morgan that the Space Hulk contained more than Genestealers and that he knew the servants of Chaos were also aboard it. As they began to search the Space Hulk, Morgan didn't tell Dragos that his friend and mentor, Interrogator-Chaplain Lexus, had also secretly teleported aboard with a squadron of Dark Angels and had found what the Inquisitor suspected the Space Hulk held. Once the shock of the discovery passed, Lexus contacted Morgan, whose squadron was fighting a swarm of Genestealers beside the Inquisitor and Grey Knights. Acting quickly, Morgan lied to Dragos and told the Inquisitor he had just discovered a signal further into the ship and asked if he should investigate it. The Inquisitor immediately told him to find the signal, while he and the Grey Knights held back the attacking Genestealers. Morgan soon led his squadron deeper into the Space Hulk and arrived at Lexus's location, where he found the Interrogate-Chaplain beside the objective of the Dark Angels' mission: several frozen bodies of the Fallen. Before they could do anything about this discovery, however, the Space Hulk entered the planet's orbit and Morgan told Lexus they had no choice but to leave the Fallen and teleport back to their ship. Lexus told Morgan it was too risky to leave the Fallen as they were, so he was staying behind to ensure their bodies didn't survive the crash and become discovered by the Inquisition. With time running out, Morgan gave the order for their squadrons to teleport back to their ship, before trying again to convince Lexus to leave. When his old friend refused, Morgan sadly teleported away as the Space Hulk began its descent into the planet.
Totmacher	Totmacher the Mad was an Inquisitor who imprisoned the populations of entire planets for perceived slights. Though he held great power while he was alive, Totmacher was posthumously declared a heretic. Ironically, this declaration was pronounced by his successor, who came to be known as Dominic the Merciless.

Jeren Dyre	Jeren Dyre was an Ordo Xenos Inquisitor Lord, who sought to stop the Crusade of Slaughter's efforts to increase the size of the Great Rift. He first became aware of their efforts in early M42, while Dyre was securing a supply of Blackstone to study. The Inquisitor Lord had long had an interest in the material and securing his own supply, led to the discovery of a network trading in Xenos artefacts. The Adeptus Mechanicus were the main buyers of Blackstone in the network and Dyre secretly began observing them to ensure they respected the Lex Imperialis. This led to Dyre and his retinue executing several rogue Magi, but soon a number of Chaos Cults began claiming a greater portion of the Blackstone. The Inquisitor Lord would destroy the Cults with the aid of the Ordo Hereticus, though they rarely were able to recover the Blackstone itself. After this continued to happen, Dyre theorized that someone was organizing the Cults from behind the scenes. He soon pieced together that the Cult's Blackstone was being used to create a giant device that would be able to increase the size of the Great Rift. In order to confirm this, Dyre had several of the Blackstone Cultists interrogated by the Psyker Leonid Rostov, who had served as his Interrogator for twenty years. Not only was Rostov a protegee of Dyre's, but the Inquisitor Lord also considered him a son. In fact by that time, Rostov was so well experienced that Dyre had offered to make him an Inquisitor, but the Interrogator refused. Rostov claimed he still needed several more years to serve beside, Dyre and his interrogation of the Cultists bore fruit. Through the use of his powers, Rostov confirmed Dyre's theory and learned that a figure known as the Hand had been constructing a Blackstone device to expand the Great Rift. Worse still, the device was nearly complete and it would be given to the Crusade of Slaughter to use, as they rampaged across the Imperium. After uncovering such a dire threat, Dyre began researching ways to disable the Blackstone device and learned of a Xenos artefact that would succeed in that task. However it was possessed by the Hive Noble Candor Estrell and was hidden somewhere within a labyrinth located in her fortress spire. Dyre had no direct proof of the artefact's existence, so he could not simply demand that Estrell give it to him. Nor could Dyre try to claim it by force, as he did not know where the artefact was located and this would just give Estrell time to have it spirited away. So Dyre and retinue waited and studied Estrell's spire instead and they soon learned that an Unsanctioned Psyker, named Saquie, made frequent visits to the Noble's spire through the use of secret tunnels. Saquie was being paid by Estrell to provide psychometric readings of the Xenos artefacts the Noble collected, which included the artefact needed by Dyre. This led the Inquisitor Lord to have Saquie captured, but Psyker refused to tell them what they wanted to known. With time growing short, Dyre ordered Rostov to do what was necessary to gain the location of the artefact and how to escape from Estrell's labyrinth. Rostov succeeded at the cost of Saquie's life, but the Unsanctioned Psyker had also been a powerful seer who could see the future. As Rostov used his psychic abilities to draw out the information they needed, he learned the heavy price Dyre would pay to claim the artefact. Estrell was aware that Saquie had been kidnapped and, while she did not know who had taken the Psyker, the Noble had her security forces laying in wait within the labyrinth. If Dyre went to take the arterfact, then the Inquisitor Lord and his retinue would be ambushed by Estrell's forces. In the ensuing battle, Dyre would die along with most of his retinue. Rostov told the Inquisitor Lord of what he had learned, but when Rostov told him they would succeed in escaping with the Xenos artefact, Dyre became resolute to continue. He however made sure to promote Rostov to the rank of Inquisitor, before they made preparations to raid Estrell's spire.
Kal Jerico in Above & Beyond	Kal Jerico in Above & Beyond is a series of comics written by Gordon Rennie and illustrated by Wayne Reynolds and Ralph Norsley, originally published in the Warhammer Monthly magazine. The series was collected in Kal Jerico: Underhive Bounty Hunter (2005) and Kal Jerico: The Omnibus (2011). While on Necromunda under the name Heleana Jerico (an almost perfect anagram of Jena Orechiel), she became mother to Kal Jerico with Lord Gerontius Helmawr, the Planetary Governor. She later described this as "just one of the many disagreeable things one has to do for the greater good of the Imperium".[1b]
Ordo	Ordo may refer to:
Desvalle's Holy Circle	Desvalle's Holy Circle is a powerful personal force field that was once owned by the renowned Ordo Hereticus Inquisitor Lord Gastor Desvalle. It came into the Ecclesiarchy's possession after the Inquisitor Lord's death and is now a blessed relic. When activated Desvalle's Holy Circle, not only sheathes its wearer in a nigh-impenetrable force field, but also projects a holy aura that drives back unnatural entities and prevents them from manifesting.
Titus Endor	Titus Endor was an Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus and former associate of Inquisitor Gregor Eisenhorn. Titus started his career serving under Inquisitor Hapshant of the Ordo Xenos along with Eisenhorn, where they both rose to the rank of Interrogators. Though they were equal in rank, and friends, Titus saw himself as Hapshant's favored pupil and the one who had greater potential to become an Inquisitor. Despite his feelings of supremacy Titus and Eisenhorn worked well together and Hapshant sent them on many missions as a team. It was during one such mission that they were sent to the Feral World Brontotaph; where Titus was attacked and nearly killed by a Saurapt, the world's alpha predator. Titus drove the animal off, but not before it had sank its teeth into him and left him a large scar. Eisenhorn dug one of the Saurapt's teeth out of him and Titus later made a necklace out of it, which he wore for the rest of his life. The natives of Brontotaph later warned Titus that he was damned, since the Saurapt still lived and it would continue to stalk him, even as a spirit, until it had killed him. They explained that if he wanted to be free of the curse he would have to track and kill the animal, a notion that Titus dismissed as silly superstition and soon left Brontotaph. Some time after Titus' encounter with the Saurapt, Inquisitor Hapshant contracted deadly Cerebral Worms which began to devour his brain. Though he began to descend into lunacy, Titus and Eisenhorn served loyally under Hapshant until his death; when the damage caused by the worms became too much for his body to handle. As Hapshant collapsed both of his Interrogators were there, with Titus trying in vain to wipe away the worms emerging from his mentor's eyes as he died. After Hapshant's death Titus and Eisenhorn went on to became Inquisitors themselves and began their own careers. Sometime after becoming an Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos, several of Titus' prior cases came under scrutiny by the Ordo. Details about his cases were reviewed and followed up on and accusations about his character were brought against him, despite his stellar reputation. Though Titus knew that it was all petty politics behind the charges, he could not prove his innocence. So when Inquisitors of the Ordo Malleus suggested he transfer to their Ordo, in order to have the charges dropped, he took the offer. In return they had demanded that he spy on his friend Eisenhorn, who they accused of Radicalism, which Titus agreed to, wanting to help his friend. The fallout from this would destroy their friendship and see a sharp decline in Titus' career as an Inquisitor.[Needs Citation]
Pyrus Reach Sector	The Pyrus Reach Sector is located on the remote edges of Imperium space and holds worlds rich in raw materials needed to feed the Imperial war machine. Those worlds are now at risk of slipping from the Imperium's grasp however, as the enemies of Mankind have converged upon the Pyrus Reach Sector; each with their own goals to achieve.
Czevak	High Inquisitor Bronislaw Czevak is an Inquisitor Lord and renowned member of the Ordo Xenos made famous by his in-depth study of the Eldar.[1a] Czevak was born in mid M41. He studied at Schola Byblos. During his time there, while at the firing range his bolt pistol jammed and exploded, leading Czevak to think he was dead and wetting his robes. He survived, but this incident remained one of his most embarrassing memories, causing self-loathing and disgust.[1f] He was mentored in the Ordo Xenos by Inquisitor Furneaux, and became an Inquisitor in the Ordo. When Furneaux died during the mysterious events surrounding the Second Klestry Forest War, Czevak engaged the loyalties of Furneaux's bodyguard and henchwoman Living Saint Joaqhuine Desdemondra, as much to study her miraculous gift and its relationship to his researches as out of the need for an able bodyguard.[1a]
Inquisitor (game)	Inquisitor is a narrative skirmish game set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, released in may 2001. Players choose a warband, usually made up of an Inquisitor and his/her henchmen, but also potentially led by any of a huge variety of rogues and heroes from throughout the Imperium such as Rogue Traders, Space Marines or Tech-priests. It even offers the chance to take on the guise of some of the Imperium's greatest enemies, such as Chaos Sorcerers, Genestealer Cult Leaders or twisted Mutants.[1a] The game supported by Games Workshop's Specialist Games division, which periodically released new rules for the game through their website. The game is intended for older wargamers, aged 16 and up.[1a] Inquisitor uses a rules system based around the throwing of two 10-sided dice (known together as a d100), generating a percentile value, with one die representing the "tens" and the other representing "units". Standard six-sided dice are used for several of the game's mechanics also.[1a]
Gregor Eisenhorn	All my life I have had a reputation for being cold, unfeeling. Some have called me heartless, ruthless, even cruel. I am not. I am not beyond emotional response or compassion. But I possess - and my masters count this as perhaps my paramount virtue - a singular force of will. Throughout my career it has served me well to draw on this facility and steel myself, unflinching, at all that this wretched galaxy can throw at me. To feel pain or fear or grief is to allow myself a luxury I cannot afford. Gregor Eisenhorn, 240.M41[1b] Gregor Eisenhorn was a renowned Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos, active during the third and fourth centuries of M41. Initially a Puritan of the Amalathian faction[1b], Eisenhorn's ideology would alter over the course of his career so dramatically towards Radical Xanthism that other members of the Inquisition would consider him possibly heretical. Indeed, Eisenhorn has officially been considered a rogue agent at least twice in his Inquisitorial career, only to be proved righteous both times.[3x][4x]
Talia Daverna	Talia Daverna (rosette number 9588/D7[1b]) was a Lord Inquisitor of the Ordo Hereticus active during the 13th Black Crusade. She oversaw all Inquisitorial assets within the Cadian Gate.[1a] When the evacuation of Cadia was called for by Lord Castellan Ursarkar Creed, Daverna attempted to stop all efforts to leave the planet due to fears of corruption amongst the survivors, but her order to halt the evacuation was overruled by Katarinya Greyfax, an Inquisitor with seniority. Later, Daverna tried to threaten Colonel Marda Hellsker, who was in charge of arranging parts of the evacuation, into stopping it, but this confrontation ended with the Inquisitor being killed by intentional friendly fire, it being written off as death to "enemy sharpshooters".[1b]
The Strange Demise of Titus Endor (Short Story)	Former contemporary of the legendary Inquisitor Gregor Eisenhorn, Titus Endor always thought he was destined for greatness. However, after a bout of unfortunate events and even more unfortunate decisions, Titus finds himself at the backwater edge of the galaxy, tracking an elusive heretic that will bring about his strange demise, a very strange demise indeed...
Malas Dyce	Malas Dyce was an Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos, who in the early days of the Achilus Crusade lead a mission to the Space Hulk Charnel Spectre, rumored to contain the remnants of a relic ship of the Great Crusade and which might have once belonged to the fledgling Inquisition. As they entered the Space Hulk, Dyce and his team (which was comprised of his Acolytes and a Deathwatch Kill-Team) came under attack by a nest of Xenos which had been living on the Space Hulk and using it as a base for centuries. Dyce and his team thought at first they were under attack by Genestealers and gave chase, only to begin to be attacked by members of their team. Far too late, they realized they were being attacked by the shape-shifting Xenos known as the Lacrymole, thought to have been wiped out by Inquisitor Parnival Gründvald after being declared Xenos Horrificus. The devious Lacrymole were killing isolated members of the group and assuming their forms to attack the rest of the unsuspecting team. Soon, only Dyce and a few remaining members of the Kill-Team were all that were left of the team and the Battle-Brothers were deeply suspicious that Dyce was an alien imposter. To save himself and bring back word of what had happened, Dyce slipped away from the Kill-Team during a firefight and made good his escape from the Charnel Spectre, leaving all of his companions behind. Upon his return, Dyce was unable to convince his peers that the fabled Lacrymole still lived and was derided for the loss of the Kill-team. He ended his career as a broken and babbling old man whispering of aliens in the dark.
Essidari	Essidari was an Inquisitor who worked with Inquisitor Eisenhorn, in the aftermath of the Thracian Atrocity.

Dupont-Brachen	Dupont-Brachen is an Inquisitor. He is accompanying the combined Ingeniators Chapter and Conclave of Progress forces, that are led by Terminator Captain Ghazi Malek and High Kâhl Drûkh, respectfully. Dupont-Brachen, the Ingeniators and the Conclave of Progress, were created by the Games Workshop employee Joe Naber. They were featured in the White Dwarf magazine's 2023-2024 A Tale of Four Warlords competition, with the Inquisitor first appearing in White Dwarf 497.
Umberco Eto	Umberco Eto, Questor of Tiarni Delta, is a Thorian Psyker Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus. His path to the Inquisition began when he was press-ganged from his home world Arbrenia and forced to work for the Rogue Trader Daskon Holpstein aboard his ship, the Prince Yugen. Eto would serve Daskon for some time, before the Rogue Trader's activities drew the attention of Inquisitor Malordnu, who quarantined the Prince Yugen and psychically tested all of the ship's crew. This led to the discovery of Eto's psychic potential and he was taken to a Black Ship for further evaluation. There, he was deemed worthy of being an asset to the Inquisition and Eto was then taken to the Inquisitorial fortress on Judgement, where he eventually became the Interrogator of Inquisitor Coteaz.
Juri Duron	Juri Duron is an Inquisitor who took part in the Pyrus Reach Conflict.
Zygmunt Molotch	Zygmunt Molotch was an influential and dangerous heretic active in the Helican subsector in the 300s and 400s M41, most notable for his attempts to decipher Enuncia. Molotch was a member of the Cognitae and arch-enemy of Inquisitor Gideon Ravenor. In 336.M41, Molotch was captured by Ravenor's team while engaged in a Cognitae scheme on Sleef Outworld. Molotch fell into a geothermal vent and was presumed dead, but managed to teleport away at the last moment.[3a] According to Orfeo Culzean, Ravenor's and Molotch's destinies were intertwined by this event.[3h] In 397.M41 Molotch investigated ancient ruins on Zenta Malhyde, managing to find traces of Enuncia, before being attacked by Ravenor's team. Molotch's flyer was shot down and he was again presumed dead, but in fact survived with grievous full-body burns.
Sanctus Wall	The Sanctus Wall is a defensive network of Systems being erected by the Imperium at the southern end of the Nachmund Gauntlet. Following the arrival of Haarken Worldclaimer's armada during the Siege of Dharrovar, the military situation for the Imperium in the Nachmund Gauntlet grew dire. At Sangua Terra, the Imperials sought to organize a defensive network collectively known as the Sanctus Wall. This consisted of systems that had previously served as Indomitus Crusade supply hubs which were quickly fortified in their own right. Imperial forces mustered all along the Sanctus Wall but knew they were not enough to withstand the incoming attack. Making a painful decision, the Imperials drew a line across the Nachmund Gauntlet at the point where the Shrine World of Centor’s Landing sat. All Imperial holdings beyond that, in the half closest to Vigilus, were to weather the storm the best they could. All Imperial holdings south of the line evacuated their populace for the Sanctus Wall, with priority given to military forces. Massive amounts of forces and supplies surged into the areas, creating discontent and instability throughout the greater region. One of the biggest boons to the defense was Indomitus Crusade Fleet Secundus' Battle Group Lambdax. Meanwhile, Abaddon was well aware that the Sanctus Wall would pose a major threat if it were completed. Even as Haarken’s fleet moved forward, Abaddon’s agents were already at work to undermine the Imperial effort to solidify the Sanctus Wall alongside cells of Alpha Legion and Word Bearers. This led to all-out war at Leopolde as entire Regiments turned traitor and attacked their former allies. Many more Regiments pledged themselves to Chaos in secret and waited for the right opportunity to strike. Many more traitors deliberately left weak points in the defenses for Chaos armies to later exploit, sabotaged supply and communication lines, and even conduct dark rituals. Not all of these actions went unnoticed, and Inquisition teams were able to round up many of the subversives, many on key locations such as Sangua Terra itself. These Inquisitorial units were organized into the Sanctus Entente under Derelei Melcho, Okal Nusa, and Atuwe Kikiya of the Ordo Militarum as well as Bataivah of the Ordo Hereticus. A second such alliance, known as the Septagrammaton Sanguis, included seven Inquisitors from the Ordo Hereticus, Ordo Malleus, Ordo Aegis, Ordo Astartes, Ordo Maledictum, and Ordo Scriptorum.
Flammel	Inquisitor Flammel was a magistrate for the fief worlds of the Grand Banks in the coreward reaches of the Helican sub. His duties had him traveling from planetary capital to planetary capital, reviewing cases gathered in by the local authorities to determine if any warranted the Ordos attention. In 223.M41 Flammel's career came to an abrupt end, when he was killed in a Warp transit accident and the newly commissioned Inquisitor Gregor Eisenhorn, temporarily took over his duties.
Zarona	Zarona is a Frontier World of the Imperium. In 089.M38, Inquisitor Galleus and his army of Dark Hunters Space Marines and Cadian Imperial Guard fought there with the traitors of Zarona. He managed to close a rift from which the chaos worshippers were drawing sorcerious power, though he had to sacrifice all of his allies. It is said that the Inquisitor didn't die and still trapped there beyond the ability of any to rescue him.
Drogan	Drogan was an Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos. Many years ago, Drogan was captured by Xenos and horribly tortured for years. This left a great hatred for aliens that made him resolve to find a way to destroy the alien threats facing the Imperium. During a journey through the Warp, Drogan let his psychic defenses down (a dangerous thing for a psyker) and a spark of Warp energy appeared before him. Upon a second trip, he was able to summon another spark and capture it in a containment device. With the blessing of his superiors in the Inquisition, Drogan began researching a means to use it against the enemies of the Imperium. Drogan arrived on the Forge World Graia and had his research in mind when he arrived. Drogan had enticed tech-priests of the Adeptus Mechanicus to allow him to conduct his research for the greater good of the Imperium. However, Drogan's experiment had drawn the attention and hire of the Ruinous Powers, and a daemon of Chaos was sent forth to retrieve the spark. The Daemon killed Drogan and took possession of his corpse, as evident by Servo-skulls found by Captain Titus of the Ultramarines. What was left of Drogan was little more than a flesh puppet, a disguise for the daemon to wear on its grim quest.
Terra	Beautiful on the surface, but rotten underneath. Don't ever, even for a second, doubt that this is the most dangerous world in the galaxy... Danger does not always come in the shape of orks with bolters, Ragnar. This world is where the elite of the Imperium have gathered. We are talking now of the most ruthless, ambitious, unscrupulous collection of rogues ever culled from a million planets. This is the place they have come to realise their ambitions, and on Terra they can, and will not let anything stand in their way. Not me, not you, not their own kin if need be. Terra , also dubbed Holy Terra and known in antiquity as Earth[13a], is the homeworld of Mankind, the resting place of the Emperor, and the most holy and revered place in the Imperium. Pilgrims throughout the Imperium flock to Terra - even the barren soil that pilgrims tread upon is considered holy. It is effectively a temple the size of a planet. As the capital world of the Imperium, Terra is also home to the main headquarters of many important Imperial organisations, including the Adeptus Terra, the Administratum, and the Departmento Munitorum.
Quixos	"My enemy’s enemy is a problem for later; in the meantime, they might be useful."- attributed Quixos, also called "Quixos the Great" and "Quixos the Bright"[3a], was a venerated Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus who became tainted by the forces of Chaos he had sworn to combat. Before his fall from grace, Quixos was one of the most revered Inquisitors in the Imperium. At the age of just twenty-one, he had burned the daemons out of Artum. His other achievements included purging the Endorian sub-sector of its false goat-gods, transcribing the Book of Eibon, tracking down and killing the Chaos Marine Baneglos, silencing the Whisperers of Domactoni, crucifying the Witch-King of Sarpeth on the battlements above his own destroyed Hive, and breaking a sub-cult of Nurgle that had tainted one of the palaces of Holy Terra itself.[3a]

Gallianus Dirk	Gallianus Dirk is an Inquisitor, who has warned his colleagues at the Jellico Conclave that of all the Chaos Gods, Tzeentch is the one they should fear the most. He feels Tzeentch embodies Chaos in its purest, most primal form and as a result the Inquisition must be tireless in its efforts to resist the Changer of the Ways's influences on the Imperium.
Tytonida Nebaszinar Falx	Tytonida Nebaszinar Falx is a Radical Ordo Xenos Lord Inquisitor.[1a] Before becoming an Inquisitor, Falx served as an acolyte on Inquisitor Kryptmans retinue.[1b] In M42, she journeyed into the murky depths of heresy, by entering into a trading arrangement with Ork Blood Axes. She was eager[1a] to find the answer of how the Warlord Ghazghkull Thraka's ascendance came to be and agreed to pay the Greenskins' price of 120 Imperial weapons, of various sizes, and the location of 15 worlds the Blood Axes could safely raid[1a]. Many have lost their minds trying to unravel the mystery of Thraka's rise to power, but after trading with the Greenskins[1a], Falx now has in her custody the one creature in the universe who claims to know the truth of it all: The Warlord's Banner bearer, Makari the Grot.
Tirszesh Eridi	Tirszesh Eridi is an Inquisitor, who is among the Inquisition's forces combating Abaddon the Despoiler's efforts to collapse the Sanctus Wall.

Ordo Hydra	The Ordo Hydra is an extremist faction of the secret Illuminati society.[Needs Citation] Both the mainstream Illuminati and its more extremist faction are devoted to saving humanity, but where the Illuminati's intent is to sacrifice to the Emperor his immortal sons, the Sensei, the Ordo Hydra's plan is to link all of mankind through the Hydra warp entity, offering salvation through total enslavement. Mankind would be ultimately in the control of the masters of the Ordo Hydra. The combined power of mankind would be enough to totally destroy all that threatens its survival.[Needs Citation] Many of the Ordo Hydra's members are Inquisitors, in effect making the ordo overlap into the Inquisition and making it, at least seemingly, a faction of both the Inquisition and the Illuminati.[Needs Citation]
Echran	Echran is an Inquisitor who took part in the 13th Black Crusade. When the Imperium world Kantrael began to suffer unrest and risked falling into anarchy, Echran took direct control of the 312th Gudrunite Rifles regiment and led them in restoring order on the world. He then led them in hunting down and killing cadres of the Traitor 9th Traitor Guard, which had been instigating the unrest.
Fawren	Fawren is an Inquisitor, who sought to retrieve information from a heavily guarded cogitator for the Ordo Sicarius. However while the Inquisitor was able to reach the cogitator, Fawren's retinue was attacked. They were soon overwhelmed and Fawren's fate is unknown. Fawren is mentioned in a garbled transmission by one of the Inquisitor's retinue. Therefore, its not known if Fawren is part of the Ordo Sicarius, or is merely aiding them.
Ordo Sicarius	The Ordo Sicarius is a relatively recent department of the Inquisition, created to monitor the Officio Assassinorum. Following the Age of Apostasy, led by Goge Vandire, came the Wars of Vindication within the Office of Assassins itself. The Officio had become riddled with corruption and the Grand Master of Assassins brought it to its knees in order to purge it. The Officio was reduced to ruins and needed a full reorganization. Following a thorough investigation, Inquisitor Jaeger deemed that a special order of the Inquisition was needed to monitor and control the Officio much more closely. His proposal was accepted and the Ordo Sicarius was created, to monitor the Office for signs of corruption and to expose and to punish the responsible parties. At the Inquisition's request, the Officio Assassinorum also agreed to the following changes:
Jarndyce Frain	Jarndyce Frain was an Legate-Inquisitor of the Ordo Hereticus and major Imperial figure in the Badab War. Frain was amongst the first to report on the treasonous activity of Lufgt Huron, and helped organize the initial Imperial response in the Maelstrom Zone. While he was the technical overall commander of Imperial commanders in the Badab Warzone, he most commonly deferred to Verant Ortys, Chapter Master of the Red Scorpions. After the conflict he carried out the Edict of Obliteration at the behest of the High Lords of Terra, putting the Lamenters, Mantis Warriors, and Executioners on trial while effectively erasing knowledge of the war from the wider Imperium.
Abram Fex	Abram Fex is an Ordo Hereticus Inquisitor who is taking part in the Antian Sector Conflict.
Enoch (Inquisitor Lord)	Enoch was an Ordo Hereticus[1a] Inquisitor Lord, who conducted a purge of the Schola Progenium on Isis IX. During the purge though, he would come across one of its orphans, Silas Hand and soon afterwards Enoch inducted Hand into his retinue, as an Interrogator[1b]. The Inquisitor Lord would serve as the Interrogator's tutor in the matters of the Ordo Hereticus[1a], until Hand proved himself and joined the ranks of the Ordo, as an Inquisitor.[1b]
Burning Princess	The Burning Princess is an alpha-plus level Rogue Psyker in the Calixis Sector, who is known mostly for Pyromancy. In 656.M41, she appeared to be a bald-headed woman in her late teens. According to damaged records, a nine year-old child named Lottie (surname unknown) manifested powerful pyrokinetic abilities. A witch hunter team was sent to collect her for the Black Ships, but all records of the results of that mission were destroyed. A pyrokinetic girl with a witch hunter's brand on her cheek was involved in a rebellion on Pellucida IX, which brought her to the attention of the Ordo Hereticus. Since then, she has worked alongside the pirates of the Storm Walker in the Hazeroth Abyss, the mutants of the Stigmatus Covenant, a variety of violent rebellious & heretical groups, and is thought to have been the one who burned down Acreage's Cathedral Mount, which killed ten thousand pilgrims and citizens of the world, including all of the senior clergy. The Burning Princess also killed the Ordo Hereticus Inquisitor Fhendahl on Dusk, as well as the specially equipped taskforce he used in his failed attempt to apprehend the Rogue Psyker. Rumours of a 'burning woman' taking part in civil unrest on St. Astrid's Fall in 656.M41 merited an Inquisitorial agent being sent after her, but all contact with said agent was lost
Kantrael	Kantrael is a Forge World of the Imperium in the Cadian Sector. It is famous for its Kantrael-pattern Lasguns, used by Cadian Shock Troopers. Kantrael experienced massive unrest in the early weeks of the 13th Black Crusade.

Later, Echran and the 312th hunted down and killed cadres of the Traitor 9th Traitor Guard, which had been instigating the unrest. Kantrael M36 lasrifle
Jaq Draco	Jaq Draco was an Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus.[1a] Inquisitor Jaq Draco was born on Xerxes Quintus, a planet rife with mutants and psykers. It had only recently been rediscovered and unified within the Imperium. Draco's parents were Imperial adepts sent to the planet. After they were killed he was raised as an orphan in a Mission School on the planet. Draco was discovered to be a psyker; when a Black Ship arrived he was taken and brought to Terra. He was one of the very few aboard the Black Ship judged to be psychically powerful enough to be allowed to live and go on to become an Inquisitor.[1a][2a] Draco and his retinue were dispatched to Stalinvast to monitor supposed Genestealer Cult activity. During their investigations, however, they were drawn to a Human Harlequin known as Zephro Carnelian and the Warp Entity known as the Hydra. Draco and his retinue managed to break free of the Hydra's control, but failed to capture Carnelian save his hat, which bore an image similar to the mythology of the Star Child.[1b]
Ignatious Garradan	Ignatious Garradan is an Ordo Scriptorum Inquisitor, who is among the Inquisition's forces combating Abaddon the Despoiler's efforts to collapse the Sanctus Wall. During the course of doing so, Garradan completed a long investigation that led him to seize a very high ranking Imperial official. This was after the Inquisitor discovered the official had a minute tattoo of a multi-headed serpent on her neck. However she has refused to explain the meaning behind the tattoo and has only spoken in riddles.
Garric (Inquisitor)	Garric is an Ordo Xenos Inquisitor who was present in an Imperial city, when it was the target of a Waaagh! led by Warboss Nazgob. Luckily the city was defended by the Cadian 92nd, led by Captain Guillaume, who were also charged with evacuating Garric to safety, via a Valkyrie, as he possessed vital needed information. As the battle commenced, the Waaagh! was able to reach the city, despite being under fire by the Cadian 92nd, and soon came to grips with the regiment. As the Waaagh! began to ramapage through the city, Garric was nearly killed by the Orks, but the Bullgryn Rogg and his Auxilia managed to safely escort him to the Valkyrie. Before it left, however, Nazgob tried to reach it to kill the Inquisitor, but Rogg once again saved Garric's life by caving the Warboss' head in. Afterwards, the Valkyrie, with the Inquisitor within it, lifted off and escaped; despite coming under heavy fire from the Orks.
Arreteia Dhorne	Arreteia Dhorne is an Ordo Hereticus Inquisitor, whose Acolytes have discovered that three-quarters of the Imperium Nihilus Systems bordering Vigilus, have been consumed by rebellion and civil war. She knew that Abaddon the Despoiler was responsible and he that was instigating the upheaval in order to prevent Imperium Nihilus reinforcements from reaching Vigilus. Dhorne also learned that her networks of Acolytes in the compromised Systems were being actively dismantled. This was no coincidence and the Inquisitor believed that Abaddon's forces were trying to find her. Dhorne had manged to escape from the Despoiler's clutches once before, but the Inquisitor feared she would be able to do so again. This led her to record what she had discovered about the Systems and Abaddon's pursuit of her. Dhorne concluded by asking that if anyone in the Inquisition heard her message, that they should warn the Imperium. The Inquisitor then began quickly sending the recording out, via any means available to her.
Erasmus (Inquisitor)	Erasmus is an Ordo Hereticus Inquisitor who gave details to the Ordo on the successful extermination of the Genestealer Cult infestation on the Imperial world of Ungor. Among his known exploits is the destruction of the Sect of the Dark Light Chaos Cult.
Daska	Daska was an Inquisitor active in M39. He was responsible for overseeing a survey of a Space Hulk designated the Unholy Harbinger while it was present in realspace in the Cloras System. On an expedition in the deeper areas of the Hulk, the survey team discovered what they initially thought was a small, dense asteroid embedded in the hull but, on further examination, the "asteroid" was actually a mass of unidentifiable metal. Daska immediately quarantined the Hulk, restricting access to himself and his personal team while he combed the database of the survey ship, the Indomitable Presence, for mentions of similar discoveries. Afterwards, he and his men returned to the Harbinger to conduct experiments on the metal. Eventually, Daska had one of his tech-priests reactivate a generator aboard the Hulk to supply energy to the metal. The metal started to shift and reform into a platform housing a swirling portal but before the Inquisitor could examine it further, metallic skeletal creatures emerged from the portal and slaughtered him and his team.
Indomitus Crusade	The Indomitus Crusade is a Crusade that was launched by the resurrected Primarch Roboute Guilliman, after he declared himself Lord Commander of the Imperium's armies during the Thirteenth Black Crusade. The main aim of the Crusade is one of reconquest, as Guilliman intends to liberate those Imperial worlds embattled by the forces of Chaos following the creation of the Great Rift, which has divided his Father's Empire in half. The undertaking of Indomitus Crusade was so grand that it echoed the Great Crusade of old. It was not until Guilliman departed from the Throneroom of the Imperial Palace after meeting with the Emperor that he declared the need for the Indomitus Crusade, leaving some to speculate it was the Emperor's will as opposed to his own. Resources for the Crusade Fleets' muster came from many worlds capable of producing vast material output. Terra, Mars, Jupiter, Armageddon, Bastrophol and Shenjin are known to have taken part in this endeavor. Military forces meanwhile, were garnered through withdrawing forces from Imperium Sanctus Systems left untenable due to the impact of the Great Rift. This process spawned a great deal of resentment, however, and several mutinies were done by forces unwilling to abandon their posts. In the end though, the withdrawals succeeded in providing vast numbers of warriors and war machines, for the growing Crusade fleets. These fleets would take shape in several Systems, including Sol and Gehenna. Guilliman's forces consist of troops from over a dozen Space Marine Chapters led by the Imperial Fists. These are joined by Imperial Guard, Mechanicum, Custodes, Sisters of Battle, Imperial Navy, Skitarii, Legio Cybernetica, Collegia Titanica, Knights, a small contingent of Sisters of Silence, and the newly created Primaris Space Marines created by Archmagos Belisarius Cawl. With the Astronomican in a state of disarray due to the formation of the Great Rift, the Indomitus Crusade risked only short jumps through the warp. One of the earliest known actions saw the Grey Knights cleanse Jupiter's moon of Ganymede of Daemonic taint, subsequently transforming it into a major Hub-Fortress for the Crusade. The earliest goal of the Imperials in the first months of the Crusade was the recapture of Warp Nexuses around Terra, such as those at Vorlese. Eight of these Nexuses were assailed by the forces of Abaddon, who sought to isolate the Throneworld. As the Imperials struggled to retake the nexues, the Crusade was forced to instead take more dangerous and time-consuming warp routes.
Garalas	Garalas is an Ordo Xenos Inquisitor, who is taking part in the War of Beasts on Vigilus. When it was discovered that the world's moon, Neo-Vellum, was infested by the Pauper Princes Genestealer Cult, Garalas unleashed a requisitioned strike clade of Skitarii upon them.
Nemesis Tessera	Nemesis Tessera is an Imperium World located near the Eye of Terror. A secret Inquisition fortress is located on Nemesis Tessera, built in the style of a dungeon. Its structures are buried deep beneath the planet's surface, which is nothing but a wasteland. During the 2nd Black Crusade, Black Legion forces assaulted the Fortress on Nemesis Tessera which freed several Daemons kept captive there.
Gao	Gao was an Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos. When the Inquisitor brought a Necrontyr datacane to the Deathwatch Watch Fortress of Fort Volossia, he unwittingly set the stage of his own demise. The Necron Overlord Zhanatar the Vengeful soon descended upon the Watch Fortress at the head of a hundred Night Scythes. The Necron Lord succeeded in retrieving the datacane after trapping Gao in a Tesseract Labyrinth.
Nazgob	Nazgob was an Ork Evil Sunz Warboss, who led his Waaagh! in an attack on an Imperial city. As they approached the city, they came under fire from the Cadian 92nd Regiment, who were protecting it, but easily reached the Guardsmen's frontlines. In the close combat that followed, Nazgob clashed with the Regiment's Captain, Guillaume, and easily tore the Cadian in half with his Power Klaw. With the Captain dead, Nazgob looked for more targets to kill and spotted Inquisitor Garric trying to escape the city via an approaching Valkyrie. Not wanting his prey to get away, Nazgob charged the Valkyrie as Garric entered it, barging through the countless Guardsmen that were protecting it. However, just as the Warboss was about to reach the Valkyrie and the Inquisitor within it, the Bullgryn Rogg charged into Nazgob and caved his head in. As Nazgob lay dead, the Valkyrie escaped and the Cadian 92nd rallied together and defeated the Warboss' Waaagh!.
Consadine	Consadine was an Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus. At some point he battled the Chaos Sorcerer Medrethax.
Stark	Stark was a notorious Radical Inquisitor Lord of the Istvaanism faith, who planted the seeds that would eventually launch the Angevin Crusade. Stark used the patronage and the alliances he had assembled over hundreds of years to draw together a conspiracy of Inquisitors of Istvaanian convictions, who under his direction bent their will to create a movement for war to be waged in the Calyx Expanse. It took a decade of manoeuvrings in every branch of the body Imperium before their objective was at last in sight: the raising of a warrior to the rank of Lord Militant and the granting to that warrior of a writ to persecute a Crusade within the Calyx Expanse. The design of Inquisitor Lord Stark and his fellow Istvaanians was a success in all but one, crucial detail. At the last minute, the High Lords of Terra decided to pass over Lord Stark’s carefully groomed choice for Lord Militant and instead invested Golgenna Angevin as Lord Militant of the crusade. So it was that Stark succeeded in creating his crucible of blood and fire but saw the forces plunged into it led, not by a fierce and blooded warrior of his choosing, but by a weak and vain man obsessed by status and patronage. To Stark and his fellow Istvaanians, the Crusade would undoubtedly suffer a slow decline under Angevin’s leadership and it was inevitable that a stronger figure would eventually take command; for the only other alternative was that the Angevin Crusade would turn to a slaughter and the Calyx Expanse would remain a place of darkness.

Defay	Defay was a Psyker Ordo Hereticus Inquisitor Lord, who attended the Triumph of Thracian and fell to Heresy after investigating the Chaos taint on Nicodemus. There Defay and his acolyte Gravier discovered that the corruption lay within the noble bloodline of House Matheldas. With the aid of Nicodemus' Cardinal Sarthos, they succeeded in destroying the tainted House, but it was soon revealed that the Cardinal himself, was part of the corrupt Matheldas bloodline. This led Defay and Gravier to kill the now revealed Heretic Cardinal, but Sarthos' death unleashed the Daemon that had long ago possessed him. Defay was forced to destroy the Daemon using his psychic powers, but the Inquisitor feared that in doing so, he had been corrupted by Chaos' taint. This caused Defay to immediately flee, leaving Interrogator Gravier behind and then cut off contact with the Inquisition[1a]. When Gravier began to search for his master, the Inquisition intervened and assigned him, as an Interrogator to Inquisitor Reiker, who had been charged with finding Defay. Their search led them to Sepulchris, where they confronted Defay as he was investigating how to open a Warp gate on the world. Ultimately though, Gravier's loyalty to his former master won out and Reiker was killed in the battle that followed. But by then, Defay had fallen to Heresy and he then killed Gravier, before opening the Warp portal[1b]. What became of Defay after this though, is not known.[1a]

Angron's Monolith	Angron's Monolith is a Chaos monument, located in the Equatorial Jungles of the planet Armageddon.[1g] The monument was erected to honour Angron, Daemon Primarch of the World Eaters. Built during the First War for Armageddon, the monolith is twelve feet tall and composed of blocks of roughly-hewn stone and abandoned weapons that have been fused together by the raw essence of the Warp.[1g] The monolith's very presence is enough to corrupt the jungle around it and interfere with local spatial geometry, meaning that the monolith is both difficult to locate in the first place and to escape from.[1a][1d][1f] The Relictors Space Marine Chapter deployed to the equatorial jungles in the Third War for Armageddon, ostensibly to eliminate the Feral Orks that infested the jungles following the Second War for Armageddon before they could reinforce the Orks elsewhere on the planet.[1b] In actuality, the Relictors were scouring the jungle in search of the monolith, despite pleas for their assistance in other theatres of the war, in order to locate a shard from an axe, wielded by Angron in the First War, that was embedded in the stones.[1c][1g]
Vigilus	Vigilus is an Imperial world that is a key route through the Great Rift and, as a result, has become heavily contested by various factions. Currently, xenos such as Orks, Genestealers, and Eldar as well as the forces of Chaos have embedded themselves on the planet and it stands on the verge of collapse. In the years before the opening of the Cicatrix Maledictum, Vigilus was a vital source of manpower and material for the Imperium’s endless wars. The planet is made up of vast hive cities and colossal forges, broken up by dust-bowl wastelands and fortified reservoirs holding the planet’s scarce supply of potable water. For its economy, Vigilus was known for its exporting of excellent defensive technology thanks to an STC device found by local Tech-Priests. The STC allowed them to produce bastion-class force fields which soon became popular in the greater Imperium. The Force-fields are a staple of Vigilus and a cornerstone of its defense. In this time the world was ruled by Governor Lucienne Agamemnus IX, part of a dynasty that had overseen the planet's affairs for millennia and had long ago signed a treaty with the Mechanicum.[5a] Despite its power, the Agamemnus Dynasty was constantly subverted by the power of the Ecclesiarchy, which managed to gain influence over the world's PDF (known as the Vigilant Guard and Vigilant Creedsmen) as well as local Imperial Guard garrisons. The Ministorum brought in Adepta Sororitas enforcers to make sure their power over Vigilus was not tested. Despite this all-out war between the Agamemnus Dynasty, Mechanicum, and Ecclesiarchy was avoided thanks to a combined body known as the Aquiliarian Council.[5a]
Ivixia Dannica	Ivixia Dannica is an Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus. Ivixia Dannica was recruited from one of the Schola Progenia on Alena-Mora. She was the daughter of an Imperial Guard Colonel whose regiment was assigned to Inquisitor Grainne of the Ordo Hereticus during the Sargossa Schism to investigate the Cardinal of Alena-Mora. This investigation led to an armed quarantine for the Cardinal's followers and persecution of the Cardinal, who was punished for apostasy. Colonel Dannica’s regiment received feudal rights over the remains of the Cardinal's world.[1b] Ivixia, known for her devout faith in the Emperor and the Ecclesiarchy, learned the importance of loyalty and the dangers of apostasy from her father. Upon hearing of the Cardinal's execution and his heretical actions, she developed a strong hatred for heresy. Although many expected her to join the Adepta Sororitas, her path soon diverged.[1b]
Mattius Heiron	Mattius Heiron is an Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus. On Cordassa Heiron was in search of the Liber Nefestum, a book about chaos-sorcery he wanted to snatch from the following of chaos and use it against them.

Ordo Scriptorum	The Ordo Scriptorum is a smaller Ordo of the Inquisition. Based on Terra itself, it is dedicated to the examination and investigations of the vast stockpile of Imperial records. As the Imperium constantly strains under the weight of its own colossal bureaucracy, important facts and information are often lost through misfiles, time, or simple human error. Pleas for aid from Imperial Governors can go unheeded leaving worlds isolated from outside contact for centuries if these errors and oversights occur. The Ordo Scriptorum can only intercept a handful of these failures, but even once can save billions of lives. The Ordo will also oversee the Administratum's scribes, ensuring they act more efficiently and accurately thereafter. The Ordo Scriptorum also attempts to manage the Wars of the Quill among Imperial Scribes.

When first discovered in 845.M36 they were taken to a Black Ship by the Ordo Hereticus. A short time afterward, this vessel was discovered abandoned with all of its crew and passengers dead. Inquisitor Castinus led the recapture of the twins, but they escaped and killed many Inquisitors and Inquisitorial Stormtroopers in the process. Following this event, the twins were captured on Respa III by Inquisitor Commodus Voke. However, later, during a parade of captured Psykers on Thracian Primaris, the twins escaped again. In an event known as the Thracian Atrocity, the twins reaped a huge level of death and destruction. They disappeared thereafter, and are now known to roam the Agripinaa Sector.

Furneaux determined that this immortality was her real gift, though her ability to take life was admirable. He witnessed several of her resurrections, and, despite disgust at her feeding habits, quickly assigned her as his bodyguard and henchwoman. During her time in his service she was confirmed as a Living Saint.
Graia	Graia is an Imperial Forge World and home to the Legio Astraman (the "Morning Stars").[1a] Graia, nicknamed the "Crown of Miracles",[11c] is the most prosperous Forge World of the Belt of Iron and much of its production is geared towards Titan engines. Though the Adeptus Mechanicus does not make it widely known, the principle Forge networks of Graia, known as the Graian Crown, is capable of independent flight. Giant fusion engines allow it to escape its host planet's gravity and move to the nearest Mandeville Point, where it can then travel through the Warp. When the Crown leaves, its temples are stocked with munitions and its holding decks provisioned with volunteers. Once a suitable world has been discovered, the Crown's chorazine shunt thrusters lock it into a stationary orbit like a tick. Fleets of industrial harvesters descend, leeching the world of its assets as production continues above.
Crusade of Slaughter	The Crusade of Slaughter was a battle of the Indomitus Crusade. The battle was one of the first of the Indomitus Crusade and saw Imperial Crusade Fleet Tertius under Fleetmaster Cassandra VanLeskus battle against a Khornate force including World Eaters[2b] that was slaughtering its way towards the Sol System. An early victim of the Crusade of Slaughter was the Machorta Sector, including the world of Fomor III. At the command of Abaddon the objective of the Crusade of Slaughter was to expand the Great Rift with Blackstone devices.[2c] At the Battle of Machorta Sound, VanLeskus defeated the Chaos forces and the Ultramarines Unnumbered Son Ferren Areios was able to slay the Daemon Prince commanding the Crusade. Together with the sabotaging of the traitor Blackstone Device, the Crusade of Slaughter was shattered and its survivors were hunted down by VanLeskus' fleet.[2d] The battle proved that Roboute Guilliman's new organizational model for the Indomitus Crusade was effective.
Gallius	Gallius is an Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos. He has become more alarmed by the rise of the Tau Empire than any of his colleagues. What strikes him most about the Tau is their naivete, technological prowess, and unwavering belief in progress, something that reminds him of mankind during the Dark Age of Technology. As some sources state that the Age of Technology was brought to an end by mankind's reckless use of artificial intelligence, Gallius worries that if the Tau follow this same path they could represent a threat to the whole of the Galaxy.

Ghargatuloth is a daemon created from information, and is able to manifest itself and corrupt others through this media. In its youth, it walked as a mortal human being, and lived out several lifetimes, sometimes as a warlord, sometimes as a neutral observer.

At thirty-one years of age, she had served six years as a Explicator under Inquisitor Petrai Levoix of the Ordo Xenos. Among her recorded deeds were overcoming the puppet wyrds of the Ork warlord leading Waaagh! Shalkaz; defeating the Magi of a genestealer cult in the Marquand Straits; "breaking the mind" of a Hruddite Demagogue in the Pleanar campaign; and the capture of a Witchblade in the Ylir uprisings, which earned her a citation from the Congresium Xenos.
Aschen War	The Aschen War was a seven-year war waged by the Imperium against Chaos and Ork forces from 300 to 307.M40. After a bloody cult revolt on the Cardinal World of Dimmamar in 300.M40 exposed how overstretched Imperial forces in the region had become, a series of subsequent revolts and incursions erupted across the entire Sub-Sector, eventually becoming known as the Aschen War. The border regions, gradually stripped of their military resources for use in conflicts elsewhere, were ill-equipped to deal with the multitude of uprisings and xenos invasions. Eventually, a three-way war erupted between the Imperial defenders, Chaos-worshiping cults, and Ork marauders. After years of bloody conflict, the Imperium finally mustered a major counter-attack consisting of forces from the Exorcists and Dark Hands Space Marines backed by the Necromundan 54th and 60th Imperial Guard Regiments and the Order of the Valorous Heart of the Sisters of Battle. The Exorcists quickly realized that one of the keys to victory would be finding and destroying the Chaos commander in the region, a Daemon Prince known as the Horned God. When the Exorcists finally cornered the Daemon Prince in the maze-like alien ruins of the Dead World of Belphago, it was guarded by thousands of fanatical warriors and several warriors of Night Lords Chaos Space Marines it had bound to its will.

Extremis Diabolus	Extremis Diabolus is the most serious accusation that an Inquisitor can possibly give. It is used most often by Inquisitors of the Ordo Malleus for consorting with or being under the influence of Daemons. Witchcraft, practicing forbidden arts and heresy against the Emperor are all grounds for pronouncement of Extremis Diabolus. The punishment is death.[Needs Citation] This article needs work on its citations.For help on citation see the citation guidelines. You can help Lexicanum by fixing it.
Eleutane	Eulatane is an Imperial Mining World. From orbit, it appears to be a barren and rocky planet where the surface is being mined by Imperial workers. Underneath the planetary surface however, there are massive underground seas where massive troglobites dwell. These troglobites were once hunted by the planets native abhuman population who also lived in the world spanning cave systems until the day when Necrons appeared and a war was fought between the Imperium and the Necrons over the planet. The abhuman natives were believed to have been exterminated during the war, which ended with the Necrons leaving once they achieved whatever mysterious objective that they had appeared for.

Xanthite	Xanthism is a Radical philosophy of the Inquisition. Its followers are known as Xanthites. The faction is named after Inquisitor Lord Zaranchek Xanthus, executed as a heretic in the 32nd millennium. The most overtly Radical grouping within the Inquisition, it advocates the use of Warp-based weaponry, such as daemon-possessed swords, daemonhosts, and generally turning the power of Chaos against itself. It is the ultimate goal of Xanthites to harness the power of Chaos for mankind, believing that it can not be defeated as it is merely a reflection of humanity itself. However, they believe that those energies and powers created by Chaos can be turned back for the benefit of humanity, rather than being an enemy. Xanthites do not advocate giving in to Chaos, bur rather wish to capture its essence and turn it to useful rather than destructive purposes. In the same way the Imperium uses the Warp for travel, Xanthites believe that other facets of Chaos can be controlled and tamed to benefit mankind. Thus these Inquisitors investigate all aspects of the Warp and Chaos, imbuing its power into themselves whenever possible. They will use Chaos artifacts, Daemon weapons, dark lore, and other heretical items and knowledge to combat incursions of Chaos, heretics, and aliens. Xanthites have even been known to establish their own Chaos Cults, using the sect to unravel ancient mysteries and lore.
Thadus Valconet Horst	Thadus Valconet Horst was an Inquisitor researching the Eye of Night and Hand of Darkness prior to the outbreak of the Gothic War.

He eventually became convinced that the forces of Chaos were planning a new Black Crusade, heading towards the centre of Chaos activity in the Gothic Sector. Discovering that the mysterious artefact known as the Hand of Darkness had been stolen from Purgatory, he attempted to recover its counterpart, the Eye of Night, from Ornsworld. Again he was too late. Horst began researching the Eye of Night and Hand of Darkness from the secret Inquisitorial Fortress under the Cathedral of Savaven to discover what the artefacts might do and how to find them. While much of his work was sent to Terra, some of his later work was destroyed[2a] along with the planet by Abaddon the Despoiler's Planet Killer in 143.M41. Horst survived the attack and was involved in co-ordinating the Imperial response with Lord Admiral Cornelius von Ravensburg.

Helynna Valeria	Helynna Valeria was a Radical Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos. Inquisitor Valeria has always believed that the work of the Inquisition should be guided by the spirit and the intent of lore: to use the weapons of the enemy against the enemy. For Valeria there are no lines that cannot be crossed and anything is permitted in the defense of the Imperium. In pursuit of this goal, Valeria has become a collector of arcane and lost technological knowledge. She has spent many decades exploring the ruins of many far-flung worlds and met with the Eldar, Hrud, Ulumeathi, and Draxians to expand humanity's store of knowledge. The recovery of the Dimensional Forge has been the crowning glory of Valeria's life's work. Able to create a null zone light years in diameter, where Daemons cannot enter, the Forge was lost in an event known as The Howling. Tracking it to the Hive World of Cavlock, which was under Daemonic attack, Valeria would be tracked by the Puritan Inquisitor Emil Darkhammer. Issuing an Exterminatus order, Darkhammer saw to it that whatever Valeria was trying to uncover would be reduced to cinders. So began a vendetta between Valeria and Darkhammer. Having declared Darkhammer Excommunicate Traitoris, she has pursued him across all of Segmentum Obscurus, seeking revenge under the pretext of justice. However no other Inquisitor has intervened in their feud, fearing it could escalate into a wider clash within the Inquisition.
Hephaestos Grudd	"The Despoiler comes forth once again, and he cannot be stopped by force of arms alone. It is his will that the stars be stained red with the blood of all who oppose him. An infinite horde of fiends, mutants and cacodaemons obey his command to devour Cadia alive. But he will not stop there. If our faith in the Emperor and our force of arm prove strong, the forces of Chaos can be driven back into hell. If we are found wanting, humanity will fall." Hephaestos Grudd is an Ordo Malleus Inquisitor Lord that served on Gudrun.[1a]

Gideon Lorr	Gideon Lorr is an Inquisitor of the Ordo Hereticus. Lorr is frequently seen patrolling the pilgrim routes of Segmentum Pacificus to hunt down marauders. Yet at the same time, Lorr remains a mystery to Segmentum authorities as he frequently acts quite apart from the rest of the Inquisition. Described as a Monodominant, Lorr is a strict and fanatical Puritan. Lorr's fanaticism was best displayed while en route to the Shrine World of Jabin Terminus aboard a Merchant Fleet vessel Achen V. The vessel became becalmed in the Immaterium, an event not unheard of during Warp travel but dangerous nonetheless. The situation grew worse when the ship's Navigator fell victim to Daemons and vile creatures began to emerge from his body. Lorr confronted the struggling Navigator, putting a plasma round through his skull before any Daemon could fully emerge. But ever since this event, Lorr has displayed an uncompromising intolerance for any form of psychic ability. He sees Psykers as tainted by the Warp and will mercilessly put them down wherever he can find them. This policy has, on many occasions, put Lorr in conflict with a number of Imperial institutions. To date, Lorr has executed in excess of a hundred Astropaths. He is also rumored to have put down a good number of Navigators, which would provoke a confrontation with the powerful Navis Nobilite. But despite these controversies, for the time being Gideon Lorr is considered a valuable asset to the Inquisition, as he is relentless in his pursuit of foes of the Emperor.
War of Beasts	The War of Beasts, later sometimes known as the War of Nightmares upon the arrival of Chaos forces[6b], is the term for the ongoing conflict on the Imperial World of Vigilus. Vigilus is a world situated within the Nachmund Gauntlet and one of the few passages through the Great Rift. As such, the planet has become strategically vital for the Imperium and has become a target for a wide number of its enemies. The first major threat to Vigilus came shortly after the formation of the Great Rift in the form of the Speedwaaagh!, a large Ork Waaagh! led by powerful Speed Freeks. The attack came as Vigilus itself was wracked by nightmares, riots, and bizarre celestial events all in association with the Rift's birth. The Ork fleet was literally spat out from the Rift seemingly at random and had not decided on any particular planet to conquer itself.[3a]

Kanani	Kanani was a Radical Inquisitor Lord of the Ordo Malleus, who has since fallen under the power of Slaanesh and has taken her loyal acolytes into damnation with her. She wields a Daemonic Force Staff and has been gifted with bat like wings, capable of giving her flight.
Acolyte	Acolytes, Inquisitorial Henchmen, or Agents are the followers an Inquisitor often keeps to aid him in his duties. These can range from combat specialists and psykers to data recorders and scouts. Many of the people an Inquisitor keeps are exceptional in their devotion and skills and are often discovered during the Inquisitor's activities. Often they are one-off attachments, but if they show particular skills then they may be asked to attach themselves to the Inquisitor permanently. Most Inquisitors keep only a handful of helpers relevant to their current mission, but some keep larger numbers, often spread throughout a large area, which can be called upon at any time. In theory, almost any type of Imperial citizen can be seconded by an Inquisitor for service to the Inquisition. Some of the most frequently found archetypes are listed below. Some Acolytes are unique positions only found within the Inquisition, such as Interrogators who act as their Inquisitor's apprentice.[9a]
Galen (Inquisitor)	Galen is an Inquisitor, who took part in the Indomitus Crusade. As the Crusade's fleets were being prepared to launch, the Fleet Quintus Battleship Embrace of Fire exploded due to a plasma drive mishap. Its death caused the destruction of 6 other ships and Galen investigated the cause of the debacle. He later discovered substantial evidence that Imperial saboteurs had been responsible for the Embrace of Fire's demise. It was theorized that the sabotage was likely done to strike a blow against the control Lord Commander Guilliman now had over the Imperium. In response, Inquisitorial Kill-Teams were let loose within Fleet Quintus to ensure the saboteurs were not able to succeed again.
Trajan-III	Trajan-III is a prosperous Imperial world, that is ruled by Planetary Governor Vanderhecht and it lays in Segmentum Tempestus' Eastern Fringe. The world became endangered in late M41, when it was projected to be in the path of a Black Crusade. This news was kept from Trajan-III's wider population, so as to not cause panic as the Imperium prepared to defend the world. Its efforts to defend Trajan-III were undermined however, when insurgents composed Trajan-III's population seized the vast underground Safehaven storage facility. It was discovered that some of world's most prominent citizens were among the insurgents, but whether they had taken Safehaven to save themselves from the Black Crusade or to aid it, was not known. Inquisitor Helbrandt Grimm and the Astra Militarum was then sent to reclaim Safehaven, which lay in the world's equatorial deserts. The Inquisitor took six Guardsmen with him and they were all under strict orders to save the underground facility's supplies, as they were vital to defend Trajan-III from the Black Crusade. However after they infiltrated Safehaven, Grimm discovered that the insurgents were in fact a Genestealer Cult, whose Magnus was Planetary Governor Vanderhecht's wife. The Inquisitor discovered that the Cult was attempting to build a beacon to summon a Hive Fleet to Trajan-III, but Grimm used a Hunting Lance to set off a massive explosion that destroyed Safehaven. The Cult members within the underground facility were killed, but it is not known if Vanderhecht was among them or even if the Planetary Governor was a member.
Gerhart (Inquisitor)	Gerhart is an Inquisitor. He defeated daemon’s followers on the planet of Drex who provoked the Drex's people to cease work on the manufactorus. During the preaching to the crowd on the Drex, Gerhart was subjected to an assassination attempt of the heretics, but was saved by the Vindicare Assassin Tarim’s bullet, which was striking on the fly the heretic’s shot. Due to this “miracle”, people of the Drex completely rejected all their doubt and believed in the Emperor’s Will. Overcome with superstitious fear, the daemon’s followers took their life in the hope that they will be forgiven by the Emperor and saved from the daemon’s claws. Through the rejuve-therapy and vital stimms he looks like the man in his mid-thirties though actually during the event on Drex he was three hundred Terran standard years old.
Segmentum Tempestus	The Segmentum Tempestus is one of the Segmentums, divisions of the Galaxy, of the Imperium. Its Segmentum Fortress is located at Bakka. The Segmentum is roughly organized into 200 light-year cubes, each of which is designated as a Sector. Free from much of the Chaos-related problems of the Imperium such as invasions from the Eye of Terror or Maelstrom, Segmentum Tempestus instead suffers from Xenos invaders and raiders.

Gradsholme	Gradsholme is an Inquisitor Lord who received constant updates about the Pyrus Reach Conflict from Inquisitor Juri Duron, who took part in the fighting.
The Blood Angels Omnibus	The Blood Angels Omnibus collects the first two novels in the Blood Angels series. First published in 2008, it features the exclusive Appendix Angelus 'minipedia'. "When Brother Arkio claims to be a reincarnation of Sanguinius, the Blood Angels’ spiritual father, the message is clear: follow me or die. Rafen kneels before Arkio and swears an oath of devotion – but the words are ashes in his mouth, and in his heart, he knows that he and his brother will have a reckoning that only one of them will survive." "On the remote world of Cybele, the Adeptus Astartes of the Blood Angels Chapter fight a losing battle against the forces of Chaos. Battle-brother Arkio leads a counter-attack that has the enemy reeling, and there is talk that this is a holy sign. Is Arkio blessed by the spirit of Sanguinius, or is the turmoil for the Blood Angels just beginning?"
Armand Salmenau	Armand Salmenau is a Puritan Ordo Xenos Inquisitor of the Amalathian faith. He oversaw a Xeno-archaeological dig site within Discidia's Vorago Fastness prison complex, which uncovered a Cyranax Watchers weapon. Salmenau had planned to study the weapon with his retinue before then destroying it, but this changed when the dig site suddenly became attacked by the Necron. The Xenos sought to claim the weapon for themselves and Salmenau's retinue was not prepared to face such a powerful foe. With no choice left to him, Salmenau sealed the doors leading to the dig site; which kept the Necrons out, but also prevented the Inquisitor from escaping. The Xenos laid siege to the dig site and Salmenau and his ravaged retinue waited for aid to come. When it did, though, it was a Kill-Team from the Radical Inquisitor Lord Otto Dagover, who sought to claim the Cyranax weapon for himself. Salmenau tried to dissuade the Kill-Team from taking the weapon and warned them that Dagover's Radicalism would lead them all Heresy against the Imperium. The Inquisitor then asked them to disobey Dagover's orders, but the Kill-Team refused, leaving Salmenau to claim they would have to kill him to take the weapon then. Seconds later, though, a Necron Lord led another attack on the dig site, whose doors had remained opened after the Kill-Team had entered. The Gauss Weaponry soon turned Salmenau's retinue to ash and the now damaged doors could not close. As the Necrons advance to the dig site, the Kill-Team knew they could not stop the Xenos, who greatly outnumbered them. In order to survive, the Kill-Team members Teiras and Kyral began to prepare to fire Cyranax weapon; which greatly angered Salmenau. He made no move to stop them, though, and instead went to aid the rest of the Kill-Team defending the entrance to the dig site. Moments later, however, the Necron blew apart the doors and the ensuing Gauss fire disintegrated one of Salmenau's hands. The wounded Inquisitor played no further part in the battle, which ended with the Necron destroyed by the Cyranax weapon's powerful energy blast. Afterwards the Kill-Team returned to Inquisitor Lord Dagover and they left Discidia with the weapon, Salmenau had uncovered. Salmenau has had extensive Rejuvenat treatments done and looks young, despite being older than at least a century. When Otto Dagover's Kill-Team reached Salmenau's dig site, Teiras noted that the Inquisitor had made sure that not a single one of his hairs was out of place.
Badab War	The Badab War is the name given to one of the most serious rebellions in recent Imperial history. While the conflict is named for a planet (or system of the same name), the war actually took place throughout the several sectors of Imperial space known as the Maelstrom Zone. The war saw four entire Space Marine Chapters secede and rebel against the Imperium.[1a] The Badab War is notable for several reasons; the leader of the rebellious forces, Lugft Huron, would survive the end of the war and return to trouble Imperial space once more as the Chaos-alligned warlord known as Huron Blackheart, while the conflict itself involved a significant number of warring Space Marine Chapters as the primary participants.[1m] While the war is officially reckoned to have lasted between 901 and 912.M41, outright warfare did not break out until 904, while the situation that led to the Badab War began much, much earlier.[1a]
Abyssal Crusade	The Abyssal Crusade was an Imperial Crusade undertaken in 321.M37. The judgement of Saint Basillius found thirty Space Marine Chapters lacking faith. The guilty Chapters were given a choice between death or embarking upon a great crusade into the Eye of Terror. All would choose the latter. After the Ecclesiarchal Purges of the Age of Redemption in 321.M37, the powerful and influential Saint Basillius emerged as an ascendant figure in the Imperium. He even commanded a 'puritas division', several Space Marine Chapters that purged all he commanded. He worked with the Inquisition and Adeptus Arbites across Segmentum Solar, making it mandatory for the populace to inform anyone they suspected as being affiliated to Chaos or Mutants. The few civil liberties in the Imperium were striped back even further, and false allegations were common. However, the level of insurrections in Segmentum Solar dropped almost completely. When the Warp Storm Dionys appeared, it spread over dozens of systems and levels of mutation and cultist activity rose dramatically. Worse still, those Adeptus Astartes Homeworlds that lay in the path of the Warp Storm had their gene-seed corrupted. When Saint Basillius heard of this, he declared all those Chapters whose homeworlds had become corrupted to be rendered into his judgement. Such was his influence that the High Lords of Terra agreed to the decision, and 30 chapters were found to be corrupted. Basillius ordered that the 30 Chapters take part in a great Crusade into the Eye of Terror, and one by one the Chapters solemnly undertook their quest of certain doom.
Kartize	Kartize is an Ordo Xenos Inquisitor of the Askellon Sector, who believes that one must not hesitate to kill Xenos, just because they are sentient. With the survival of the Human race at stake, at the hand of the abominable Xenos, there can be no hesitation.
Diala Endenvarr	Diala Endenvarr is an Ordo Malleus Inquisitor active in the Askellon Sector. The Inquisitor's Acolyte, Jerren Oberzin, has fearfully seen how Endenvarr's service to the Ordo has changed her greatly from the person he once knew. This fear, though, has convinced Oberzin that he is still unfit to carry on the Inquisitor's work.
Beta Anphelion IV	Beta Anphelion IV is the fourth moon of Beta Anphelion, a planet in the Anphelion System. It was the site of the Anphelion Project.
Stygies VIII	Stygies VIII is a large Forge Moon (eighth in a row) which orbits a massive ringed gas giant in the binary star system of Vulcanis.[1a][3b] Stygies VIII is the 8th moon orbiting the gas giant Vulcanis.[1a][3b] It is a trove of Xenos technology, and their ruling Tech-Priests use diversionary actions and binharic sub-codes to conceal their forbidden treasure trove from the wider Imperium. The current Fabricator General of Stygies VIII is Sigma 3-Soth. It is home to the best munitions artisans and one of the few worlds which produces Leman Russ Vanquishers. It was once home to the Legio Vulcanum I and II, but they turned traitor and now houses the Legio Honorum.[1a] Of all Forge Worlds, Stygies VIII produces the best gun barrels and recoil dampeners, and the finest quality propellant chemicals.[1c]
The Path Unclear (Short Story)	The Path Unclear is a short story by Mike Brooks. A mysterious sword. Alien ruins beneath a shattered city. A wealthy recluse whose home hides all manner of dangers. What do these seemingly disparate things have in common, and how are they the keys to a mystery? That's the question Inquisitor Zaretta Ngiri and her associates must answer as they unravel the threads before it's too late.
Silas Hand	Inquisitor Silas Hand was born on the planet Isis IX in the Polaris sub-sector. Due to his frequent travels through the warp while executing the duties of an Inquisitor, Silas's exact birth date cannot be confirmed.[1a] Silas Hand caught the attention of Inquisitor Lord Enoch during the purging of the Schola Progenium facility where Silas was raised. Enoch found in him a successor that could continue Enoch's legacy and was taken in to his retinue as an interrogator. Hand gained new skills rapidly while working for Enoch and steadily rose in the ranks of the Inquisition. As a Daemonhunter, Silas Hand came to know things no sane man would willingly seek, and served the Imperium with a zealous drive that made him stand out amongst the ranks of the most holy Inquisition. Unfortunately for Hand, accusations of taint followed him closely, and whispers lingered that he delved too deep into the powers of Chaos. Furthermore, it was revealed that there were three instances of contact with a Warp entity known as Grimspyre. In each case, the Inquisitor was bested by this entity but eventually survived these encounters, suggesting the possibility of having his life deliberately spared as part of some devious plan on the part of the entity.[1a]
Severnius	Severnius was an Ordo Xenos Inquisitor who served as the mentor and first commander to famed Deathwatch member Artemis. Serving alongside Artemis for decades, he proved essential in a battle against a dangerous race of Xenos on the Agri-World of Tarrenhorst. Since these xenos were able to psychically dominate their victims, Severnius's own psychic abilities were the only thing which saved his Kill-team. However, over the course of a desperate six-day battle, Severnius was forced to maintain this shield, a process which exhausted him. Just before they were rescued by Thunderhawk gunships, a weakened Severnius was struck down by a psychically-enslaved Space Marine, thus passing command of the Kill-Team to Artemis.
Ordo Redactus	The Ordo Redactus is an Ordo of the Inquisition. They seek to deliberately obscure and undermine knowledge of the Inquisition's founding, lest the enemies of Mankind discover some advantage through the information on the Inquisition's beginnings. As a result, they frequently come into conflict with the Ordo Originatus.
Indigo	Indigo is a famous Ordo Hereticus Inquisitor Lord.
Keeler (Inquisitor)	Keeler was an Inquisitor who was contacted by the Rogue Trader Dausen, after he discovered the Squats in 5709722.M34. Because they were heavily mutated though, Imperial protocol dictated that Dausen should destroy the Squats, but after witnessing what they could offer the Imperium, he suspended those orders. Instead in his message to Keeler, the Rogue Trader listed the many positive attributes the Squats possessed and suggested that Keeler should send an Inquisition research team to evaluate their worlds, before deciding the Squats' fate. As history has shown, however, the Squats have become a part of the Imperium.
Garanhir Rebellion	The Garanhir Rebellion occurred in 649.M40, when the militant Inquisitor Malphas Kroh, of the Ordo Malleus, employed a precog-coven to predict an assault by a World Eaters warband on the Imperium world of Garanhir. His punitive intervention sparked an uprising by the population, which the Inquisitor put down a mere day before the berserkers attacked.[1a] When the notorious World Eater Dhalahk launched a mass incursion upon Garanhir, intent on butchering the population in the Blood God's name, he found the Inquisitor and forces from the Grey Knights, Dark Swords and Black Wings Chapters arrayed against him.[1a] The battle between them was joined without delay and while Dhalahk's berserkers inflicted significant causalities amongst the Inquisitor's forces, the entire warband was cut down in the attack. After that 7th Brotherhood of the Grey Knights were attacked by huge horde of the Bloodletters and only reconfiguration of their Dreadnoughts and creating Doomglaive Variant helped to destroy great waves of the Daemons.[1b]
Ashuria Indris	Ashuria Indris is a Radical Ordo Xenos Inquisitor, who has begun using Xenos tech in her war against them. This reflects on her retinue as well and she has in her service a Xeno-biologist Magos, who likes experimenting on Xenos they have captured. Inquisitor Ashuria Indris... ...and her Retinue
Olarius	Olarius was a Radical Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus, who was killed while in the process of creating a Daemonhost. The Daemon that Olarius tried to bind to a host was a high level Daemon who easily overcame the wards he had created where the binding was taken place. It soon killed several members of the Inquisitor's retinue and the Inquisitor sealed the room and fought the uncontrollable Daemonhost, hoping to strike it down. Olarius was no match for the power of the Daemon, however, as it struck him down and continued to savage him. Just then the ceiling-mounted sprays engaged and rained down upon them, which soon dissolved them both in holy acid.
Grey	Grey was a Master Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus. A Radical, he commanded a force of Daemonhosts. Taking part in the final battle against the Daemon Prince known as the Horned God in the Aschen War, Grey was consumed by the Daemon Prince after his Daemonhosts were wiped out.
Calixian Conclave	The Calixian Conclave is an Inquisition Conclave that watches over the Calixis Sector. It has a long and complex history, some of which has been forgotten or mixed up with conflicting records.[1a] The Calixian Conclave is commanded by Inquisitor Lord Caidin, an eminently mysterious man, who sits at the head of a High Council of Inquisitors. It has many sub-officios and conclavium councils though, which handle things on a more localised level. The Conclave has a vast amount of resources at its disposal, but most valuable of all are its field Inquisitors and their agents.[1b] Although nominally unified, the Conclave is full of independent thinkers, radicals, factions, and cabals, some of whom have objectives completely at odds with those of others, and some of whom are at each others' throats. One of the most important cabals in the Conclave is the Tyrantine Cabal, which troubles itself with a prophecy that says the star Komus will devour human civilisation.[1b]
Ordo Militarum	The Ordo Militarum is an Ordo of the Inquisition. Founded in M35, it monitors the Imperial Guard. The Ordo is large by the standards of minor Inquisition factions, with over 500 Inquisitors currently active.
Grimm (Inquisitor)	Helbrandt Grimm is an Inquisitor, who is adept at capturing subjects and in the art of interrogation. He was among the Imperial forces that defended Trajan-III, when the world found itself in the path of a Black Crusade. However before its Chaos hordes arrived, the Imperium's efforts to save the world were undermined, when insurgents from Trajan-III's population seized the vast underground Safehaven storage facility. It was discovered that some of Trajan-III's most prominent citizens were among the insurgents, but whether they had taken Safehaven to save themselves from the Black Crusade or to aid it, was not known. Inquisitor Grimm was then sent to reclaim the storage facility with the aid of the Astra Militarum, who stood watch over Safehaven's surface entrance. When the Inquisitor infiltrated it though, Grimm only took six Guardsmen with him for the mission. They were also under strict orders to preserve Safehaven's supplies, which would be vital for the world's defense when the Black Crusade struck. The mission quickly went awry, however, after the Inquisitor's group encountered several of the insurgents. While they appeared to be unarmed and asked Grimm's group not to harm them, the Inquisitor ordered the insurgents to be killed. This outraged the Guardsman Heinrik, who refused to do so and told Grimm that he could not kill unarmed innocents. The Inquisitor fired anyway and replied that their were no innocents to be found within Safehaven. His shots struck true and revealed that the insurgents were be part of a Genestealer Cult, when several of the large Tyranid organisms appeared to aid them. Between the Genestealer and the emergence of more Cultists, Grimm's group was overwhelmed and three Guardsmen were killed. Heinrik was nearly among them, after he was struck by a Genestealer, but the Inquisitor intervened and killed the Tyranid, before pulling the Guardsman to safety in a nearby room. The two other surviving Guardsmen of Grimm's group were already there and they sealed the room's door, before the Cult could reach it. The Cult then began hitting the door and the Inquisitor told the Guardsmen to defend it, while he tried to find another way out of the room. Unfortunately, the wound Heinrik suffered had been a Genestealer's Kiss and the Guardsman had already become a member of Safehaven's Cult. Before anyone could stop him, Heinrik opened the door and the Cult and Genestealers killed the two remaining Guardsmen. As the Cult moved towards Grimm, Heinrik apologized for opening the door and the Inquisitor returned the apologize before shooting the Guardsman's gun. His shot struck Heinrik's ammo cartridge and the resulting explosion killed everyone in the room, except for the Inquisitor. The blast had tossed him through a wall that had been destroyed by the explosion and before he could recover, Grimm was confronted by the Cult's Magnus.
Gehenna Prime	This article is being created or revised. Please consider this before you edit this text! Gehenna Prime is one of the seventeen planetoids in the Gehenna system - and apparently the only one that was terraformed and colonised during mankind's first expansion to the stars. In comparison to many other worlds of the Imperium it is considered to be an unspoilt wilderness of plains and mountains. Its capital and largest Hive city is Kravaster. The Governor of Gehenna Prime during the Ork invasion (see below) was called Suvik. The planet is slightly larger than Terra and its rotation is faster. As a consequence there is increased vulcanism and a belt of volcanoes some of which are active while others are only semi-active known as the Graildark mountains. This belt stretches around the equator of Gehenna Prime. Adjacent to the Graildark mountains are jungle highlands and chains of extinct volcanoes that gradually turn into broad plains north and south of the equator.
Menazoid Epsilon	Menazoid Epsilon is a Death World located in the Sabbat Worlds cluster.[1a] Believed to have been a shrine world for the forces of Chaos in the region, it was targeted for reclamation by the Imperium as part of the Sabbat Worlds Crusade.[1b][1c] Alongside the other worlds in the Menazoid Clasp, Menazoid Epsilon was targeted for reclamation by the forces of the Sabbat Worlds Crusade under Warmaster Macaroth.[1a][1c] The taking of it was commanded by Lord Militant General Hechtor Dravere[1c], who was ultimately slain during the campaign.[1f]
Gene-seed	Gene-seed is the unique genetic material used to transform a normal human into a super-human Space Marine. It is used to grow the artificial organs that distinguish an Adeptus Astartes from an ordinary human, and helps alter the human's biology to accept the implanted organs. Gene-seed is a Space Marine Chapter's most precious resource, and is conserved by extracting the progenoid glands from fallen Battle-Brothers for return to the Chapter's fortress-monastery.[Needs Citation] Several Chapters have unique gene-seed flaws that cause differences in their Marines' physiology and behavior. These differences can be merely cosmetic (for instance, all Death Spectres are albinos), while others can have drastic effects that are either a blessing or a curse (or both) for their Chapters, such as the Blood Angels or the Space Wolves.[Needs Citation]
Severon	Severon was an Inquisitor, who was ambushed and later found dead while conducting an operation based on intelligence thought to have originated from within the ranks of the Ordo Calixis. Worryingly, the psychic wracking of Severon was carefully hallmarked to replicate the horrors perpetrated by the Pilgrims of Hayte, a subterfuge that could only be orchestrated by one who is intimate with the knowledge and details of the Pilgrims' modus operandi. This has led many of his fellow Inquisitors to suspect he was killed by a traitor within the Ordo.
Daemonifuge (Graphic Novel Series)	Daemonifuge is a series of three graphic novels written by Jim Campbell and illustrated by Kev Walker. Ephrael Stern, a Seraphim of the Adepta Sororitas is kept inside the Convent Prioris upon Ophelia VII. She scribbles forbidden knowledge upon the wall of her cell. Inquisitor Silas Hand arrives to investigate, and an unlikely assassin tries to kill her. Why? Because she is the Daemonifuge.

Sons of Bael	The Sons of Bael were a Cadian Chaos Cult, that was created by the Daemonhost Cherubael on the orders of its master, the fallen Inquisitor Quixos. The Cult worshiped Cherubael, known to them as Bael, and were unknowingly used by Quixos to measure the dimensions of Cadia's pylons, which he needed to create his own versions of them.[2a] The Cult would be investigated by Inquisitor Eisenhorn, and, with the aid of Inquisitor General Neve, he discovered that the Sons of Bael were connected to a series of unauthorized landings on the world. When they learned Quixos was behind these landings, the Inquisitors and their forces confronted the Cult and in the battle that followed, the Sons of Bael were destroyed.[2b]
Massimo Ricci	Massimo Ricci was an Imperial Inquisitor in the Helican Ordo Xenos, active during the fourth century M41. He was one of Lord Inquisitor Rorken's most valued subordinates, and before his death was considered a likely successor to Rorken's position as a Master of the Ordo Xenos.[1a] Ricci was sent by Lord Rorken to Thessalon, a feudal world in the Helican subsector, to secretly meet with the outlaw inquisitor Gregor Eisenhorn in 343.M41. Eisenhorn had previously written to Rorken requesting assistance in his venture to hunt down and kill the heretic inquisitor Quixos to clear his own name, but for political reasons Rorken was forced to send Ricci in his stead.[1a] A group consisting of inquisitors Commodus Voke, Raum Grumman, Titus Endor, and Eisenhorn tracked Quixos to Farness Beta and engaged his forces.[1a][1b] During the assault on Quixos' mountain stronghold of Ferell Sidor, Ricci, Eisenhorn, and Grumman engaged Quixos in combat, during which both Grumman and Ricci were slain.[1b] Eisenhorn subsequently killed Quixos in close combat.[1c]

Ignatius Jonn	Ignatius Jonn was an Inquisitor, who interrogated the captured Cultist Coronis Agathon, who claimed to be a manifestation of Tzeentch. This would prove to be Jonn's downfall however, as he received nothing, but cryptic answers from Agathon's deranged mind, but was left somehow corrupted by the experience. He was later declared a Heretic, by his fellow Inquisitors and was executed.
Solomon Lok	Solomon Lok was the Ordo Xenos Inquisitor charged with investigating the sudden loss of contact from a research facility on Beta Anphelion IV in 850.M41. Solomon Lok was a veteran of the Chinchare Hrud Infestation. He, the Elysian Drop Troops 99th 'D' Detachment (led by Major Durra), a detachment of the Cadian 226th, an Adeptus Mechanicus Biologis Exploritas force headed by Magos Biologis Arthon (seconded from forge world Gryphonne IV) and a task force of the Red Scorpions chapter (led by Carab Culln) went into orbit above the clouded moon. After a fierce battle on Beta Anphelion IV, the Red Scorpions received orders to evacuate themselves, and only themselves. The transport requisitioned for the mission refused all of Lok's requests, stranding Lok and the small force of survivors on the moon as the Tyranids closed in. In the last battle, Lok succeeded in taking down a Hierophant bio-titan, only to see two more stride out of the ammonia fog. Lok died, betrayed by his superiors and his faith.
Ezu Ghraile	Ezu Ghraile is an Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos. Only one thing brought Ezu Ghraile to the Jericho Reach: the Tyranids. Ghraile sees Tyranids as the biggest single threat facing the Imperium today and it is a matter she will expound on at great length given any opportunity. Ghraile has based herself at Watch Fortress Erioch for the express purpose of lobbying for more action on the Orpheus Salient, where the Tyranids have been ravaging the Achilus Crusade's forces, and her clashes with the resident Inquisitor of the Chamber have been loud and public. Ghraile has a sympathetic ear from members of the Deathwatch as they fully appreciate how much of a threat Hive Fleet Dagon can become with access to enough biomass. However, it has been a harder job convincing officers of the Crusade and her fellow Inquisitors of the need to divert all reinforcements coming through the warp gate to the Orpheus Salient. Ghraile clings to hopes that the Omega Vault will open to reveal some weapon to stop the Tyranids - not just within the Jericho Reach, but across the entire galaxy.
Sharpe	Sharpe is an Inquisitor Lord of the Ordo Xenos who gave his blessings to Inquisitor Drogan to begin his research on using the Warp as a weapon against the Imperium's numerous Xenos enemies on the Forge World Graia. Drogan was in regular contact with Sharpe throughout his time on Graia, detailing his progress.
Kluctmier	Kluctmier was an Inquisitor Lord of the Ordo Xenos, who took part in the defence of the planet Granica IV when it was invaded by a splinter of Hive Fleet Leviathan. During the invasion, Kluctmier worked on a genetic virus which would kill the Tyranids, when the laboratory he was working in came under attack by the swarm.[1a] While the Imperial forces defending the base the laboratory was located in fought and died to protect him, Kluctmier finally finished his work and produced a single canister of the virus. As the Tyranids easily overwhelmed the base's defenders and made their way inside, Kluctmier and his retinue ran with the canister to his waiting shuttle. The few survivors defending the base fought on to give Kluctmier time to escape and Inquisitor Lord and his retinue nearly reached his shuttle - when a large group of Genestealers ambushed them and tore them apart.[1b] Though the canister was left undamaged, it was surrounded by a swarm of Tyranids as they cut down the last few survivors of the Imperium's forces.[1c]
Ordo Astra	The Ordo Astra is a minor Ordo of the Inquisition. Founded in M34, they oversee and study stellar cartography. The current strength of the Ordo is estimated at over 50 Inquisitors.
In Hrondir's Tomb (Short Story)	In Hrondir's Tomb is a short story by Mark Clapham. It was originally published in Hammer and Bolter 20, and re-published online in August 2015. A group of Imperial forces, including an Inquisitor and a squad of Space Wolves, becomes trapped in the tomb of a long dead warrior by heavy enemy shelling. When torn-apart bodies start to appear, the accusations fly - who or what is responsible for the deaths? Has one of the Guardsmen become corrupted by Chaos? Has one of the Space Wolves gone feral? Or is the true identity of the murderer stranger yet?
Hive World	A η-class (eta class) or Hive World is a classification of Imperial world distinguished by vast, continent-spanning cities, often built high into the sky and deep beneath the earth.[4a] Hive Worlds are estimated to comprise between 10-25% of the total quantity of Imperial planets. The exact number is difficult to establish due to the bureaucratic features of the Imperium itself. The population of every Hive World is enormous, and almost all food needs to be imported. A Hive World rendered temporarily inaccessible through Warp space will suffer a devastating famine within a very short space of time. It will become a vast catacomb of lunatics driven to excesses of anarchic, urban savagery by starvation and claustrophobia. Hive Worlds are dangerous, being too large to monitor safely, and their citizens are typically unbalanced, if not utterly crazed. It has been known for the Adeptus Arbites to cull these planets in order to bring their populations down to manageable levels. Hive Worlds have a population far too numerous to be fed or supported on their own, often exceeding a trillion inhabitants on a planet the size of Terra. These planets often have no more natural ground surface left, having become a giant urban agglomeration, with new construction happening on top of old ones. Billions of people can live crowded together in a single Hive city.[Needs Citation] Each of these Hive Worlders is a potential soldier for Imperial forces, including the Imperial Guard[4a] and the Space Marines. Hive Worlds contribute the vast bulk of the recruits for the Imperial Guard. The violent gangland lifestyle which most residents are forced to live means they are already hardened and experienced in warfare. Almost every recruit will already know how to handle a gun. Hive Worlds also serve to populate newly discovered planets. Imperial citizens are gathered from various Hive Worlds (willingly or unwillingly) and shipped off to distant colonies. An example of this would be Medusa V. Hive Worlds have huge import/export ratios, exporting a vast range of materials, and relying on imports of food and water. In common with most other Imperial worlds, Hive World society has distinct classes, with a ruling class and a working class. Invariably the lower classes inhabit the lower and more decayed and polluted levels of the Hive.[Needs Citation]
Larreth	Larreth was an Inquisitor of the Ordo Hereticus who was the first representative of the Inquisition to make contact with and examine the world and people of Krieg after they attempted to rejoin the Imperium in 949.M40.
Myron Jubalgunn	Myron Jubalgunn is an Imperial renegade and criminal, who is being pursued by the Inquisitor Toulon Hess. He is currently on Logans World, along with his unknown Xeno partner. While it is normally surrounded by a Warp Storm, the two managed to land on the world during a brief storm break. Inquisitor Hess has also reached Logans World, though, and has now warned its population to be on the look out for the dangerous criminal and Xeno. He has warned, however, that anyone who withholds information about their whereabouts, will suffer the wrath of the Emperor. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Humble Saints	The Humble Saints were a group that displayed holy miracles to the population of the Talledus System. However, they became investigated by the Ordo Hereticus Inquisitor Kaliadh Shayn, who declared them to be instead heretical Rogue Psykers. With that, the Inquisitor began purging the Saints with the aid of the 63rd Delphic Dracons and the Astral Knights, led by Captain Hadrach.
Nihilus (Lord Inquisitor)	Nihilus is a Lord Inquisitor, within the Calixis Sector. He claims the Inquisition is a hundred different schools of thought, that are all divided by a single goal.
Ilem Kharporov	Ilem Kharporov was an Inquisitor who was killed by the Archon Valossian Sythrac. Now his soul is among the thousand victims that are trapped within the Archon's armour.
Fleet Primus	Indomitus Crusade Fleet Primus was one of the Battlefleets assembled for the Imperium's Indomitus Crusade. It was led by Roboute Guilliman himself as well as Belisarius Cawl. Fleet Primus was the third fleet to depart on the Indomitus Crusade.The Fleet contained the largest number of Primaris Greyshields and had Archmagos Dominus Belisarius Cawl amongst its personnel. After it launched, Primus was noted for diverging into several spearheads, that further fractured as they spread out from Terra. Much of Fleet Primus’ initial efforts were angled towards the Segmentum Solar, for countless threats were to be found upon Terra’s very threshold. Its earliest major victory came at the Battle of Gathalamor where Custodes forces under Tribune Colquan proved decisive.[5a] Another major campaign was countering the Word Bearers Solar Incursion, which took years to accomplih.[18b] Yet this focus on Segmentum Solar was not true of all the fleet’s battle groups. Some were charged instead with pushing outwards into the deeper dark of the war-torn Imperium Sanctus. Each was assigned a quest deemed vital to the overall success of the Indomitus Crusade, and to Roboute Guilliman’s overall aim of shoring up and making safe the Imperium Sanctus. Many of the battle groups of Fleet Primus faced perils unleashed by the opening of the Great Rift. Warp plagues, mutants, Chaos Space Marine invasions, and mass uprisings were all dangers encountered by Fleet Primus’ battle groups as they pushed outward from the Sol System.
Memnon Lenka	Memnon Lenka is an Ordo Xenos Inquisitor Lord, who believes that a person's weapons are their closest friends and most trusted allies. The weapons become a part of their owner's soul and should be treated well, for the owner's life depends utterly upon them. Without them, Lenka claims, carrying out one's duty is impossible.
Archon	An Archon is the highest ranking member of a Dark Eldar Kabal and the ruling nobles of Commorragh. They are considered the single most powerful, ruthless, and cunning member of their Kabal, due to the fact that if there existed anyone who held greater ability in these aspects, they would no doubt kill their Archon and claim their title.[1b] Indeed, the singular power Archons hold over the members of their Kabal make the title incredibly appealing to subordinates, and assassination attempts are not only common, but frequent. The average Archon suffers dozens of assassination attempts before finally succumbing, and some have maintained their position even after well over three hundred attempts on their life. Despite the elaborate network of allegiances within the Dark City, the Overlords of the Kabals run rings around those who seek to beat them at their deadly game. The endless ambition of their underlings keeps their paranoia razor-sharp, and hence it is at the business of treachery that the Archons truly excel. These strategies have been known to play out for millennia. Some of the Lords of Twilight, who govern from the highest spires of Commorragh, even claim to have seized their thrones in the times before the Fall of the Eldar.
Deathwatch Core Rulebook	The Deathwatch Core Rulebook is the core rulebook for the Deathwatch Warhammer 40,000 role-playing game. It was developed by Fantasy Flight Games, a gaming company with license to produce Warhammer 40,000 and other Games Workshop products. The book contains the core rules for the Deathwatch game, as well as extensive background material.
Chief Librarian	The Chief Librarian is the strongest and most psychically attuned Librarian of a Space Marine Chapter. He is master of the Librarium and has full access to otherwise restricted parts of it that house the Chapter's most powerful and dangerous relics. His century-long studies and experience, gathered on thousands of battlefields, makes him a crucial advisor to his Chapter and its commanders. Chief Librarians often lead forces or assist the Chapter Master in battle while other Librarians aid company Captains. They also hold the overall responsibility for communications, as well as scrutinizing battle reports to provide recommendations for honour awards.
Darke	Darke was an Inquisitor, who fought in the battle of Aerius. His ship was called the Epiphany. Around M39, the Great Unclean One Botchulaz attacked the Hive World Aerius. Botchulaz was attacked by Eldar forces led by Farseer Kaorelle, but before they could defeat him, Imperial forces arrived, including Darke, along with the Space Wolves and Imperial Guard. They took the Talisman of Lykos that the Eldar had trapped Botchulaz in; it split into three parts, and Darke was given one of these parts, with the others given to the Space Wolves and Imperial Guard. Darke and his ship the Epiphany were seen making a Warp Jump into the outer systems, but they never arrived at their destination, and his piece of the Talisman of Lykos was lost to the Imperium.
Oblationist	I am damned: it is a truth that I cannot escape. It is the greatest pain I have ever born, but it is also the truest sacrifce I have ever made in the service of the Emperor and the Imperium. -- from the confession of Inquisitor Lord Godella Morn, 745.M40[2c] Oblationists are a minor Radical faction of the Inquisition. They believe that the Warp, the xenos and the unclean are utterly damning and those who utilise them must face the ultimate sanction. Yet they also believe their use is necessary to overcome mankind's enemies. Therefore the righteous must sacrifice themselves and embrace damnation in order for humanity to survive. They hold an intolerance of all other Radical factions in a manner similar to the most Puritanical factions, believing that only they may wield the weapons and knowledge of the enemy.[2c] The Oblationists were founded in the Calixis Sector in late M40 by Inquisitor Lord Godella Morn, a known Monodominant. When denounced for practicing sorcery and making pacts with dark forces before a Conclave of Inquisitor Lords, she confessed that she had used the tools of Chaos, xenos, and heretics, but professed her continued belief in Monodomination. She said she was an "Oblationist", not a Xanthite, and had damned herself in order to act “in truth rather than in wishful dreaming.” She was executed by immersion in molten brass. A small number of Puritans of the Conclave considered her arguments, however, and concluded that she was right, thus starting the Oblationist faction.[2b]
Cardinal	Cardinals are the highest-ranking officials within the Ecclesiarchy, after the Ecclesiarch. Cardinals are members of the Frateris clergy and form a group known as the Holy Synod, which elects the Ecclesiarch, the head of the entire Ecclesiarchy, from their own number. Most Cardinals lead a diocese. Although each Cardinal's diocese is outside another's jurisdiction, some rank higher than others, as they are divided into three orders. There are some several thousand Cardinals. The five Cardinals Palatine are the highest-ranking Cardinals. They do not have dioceses or other official duties, instead serving as assistants to the Ecclesiarch in the Ecclesiarchal Palace on Terra.
Manubiarix	The Manubiarix is a Necron device containing a C'Tan shard. The C'Tan shard is also referred to as the Manubiarix. The device takes the form of a black octohedron, burning cold to the touch, that fits in a human hand. The device oscillates slightly, resonating with a song in the purest binharic cant from the being trapped inside. This song can only be heard by those in the Adeptus Mechanicus who have not undergone the Rite of Pure Thought, or still retain a functioning right hemisphere of their brain. The C'Tan shard can be released from the device using a complicated series of movements, cantrips, and code in an alien language. Reversing this release protocol will immediately return the C'tan shard back into the device upon completing the sequence.
Saffor Sengir	Saffor Sengir was an Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus who spent her life seeking out the secrets of the Lord of Change Ix'thar'ganix. After learning of the Daemon’s power of foresight, Sengir slowly descended into obsession, convinced she could steal this power for the Imperium. For decades the Inquisitor scoured the galaxy for cursed objects and profane artefacts linked to the Lord of Change. Eventually, in the drifting hulk of an alien vessel, she found the bones of the Whisperer, a long-dead xenos creature once possessed by Ix'thar'ganix. With these remains, she hoped to summon the Daemon and bind it to her will. However, in 941.M41 Ix'thar'ganix instead was able to have her possessed by the Great Unclean One Lurgon. In the resulting Plague of Madness, Sengir's body was destroyed.
Parnival Gründvald	Parnival Gründvald[Note 1] is an Ordo Xenos Lord Inquisitor, who is Trantor of Guarm, a member of the Congressium Xenos, associated with the School of Helsig, and is known as the Xenoscourge of Helschen.[4a][4b] At some point before the early days of the Achilus Crusade, Gründvald discovered a small infestation of Lacrymole on Betacairn. After studying them and consulting with Lord Inquisitor Kryptmann, he called the Betacairn Conclave to declare the Lacrymole Xenos Horrificus, and get his fellow Inquisitors' assistance to find and destroy them. By the time of the Charnel Spectre Incident it was believed that Gründvald had been successful in eradicating the Lacrymole, but some may have survived, as Inquisitor Malas Dyce believed he encountered some on board the Space Hulk Charnel Spectre. By 805.M41, Gründvald had become a Lord Inquisitor, and member of the Congressium Xenos.[4b]
Abraham Vinculus	Abraham Vinculus was an Inquisitor Lord of the Ordo Hereticus who fought in the Vinculus Crusade against the assassin-cult in the Pelegeron Cluster in 833.M41. Together with Black Templars under command of High Marshal Ludoldus and a detachment of Adepta Sororitas of the Order of the Bloody Rose, the Inquisitor engaged the cult on Pelegeron IV. The landing met little opposition and the Black Templars and the Adepta Sororitas pushed the cult members back to their mountain stronghold. During the last battle of the Crusade, Vinculus confronted the cult leader and killed him. Unfortunately the daemonic presence that was building in the cult leader manifested itself and possessed the Inquisitor (who was weakened by the injuries sustained during their battle).
Zaretta Ngiri	This article is being created or revised. Please consider this before you edit this text! Zaretta Ngiri is an Ordo Xenos Inquisitor. At one time she was contacted by the archaeologist Harral Jonas, after he uncovered the Blade of Saint Aruba in a dig site on an Imperial world. Once she arrived at the dig site in Verbaden City, Jonas informed Ngiri that the Sword's unearthing had immediately caused unrest to wreak the city. A series of murders had also began to occur, though he was unsure if they were connected. After hearing this, the Inquisitor and her retinue returned to her gun-cutter to continue their investigation when they were given a package by one of Verbaden's citizens. They had been paid to do so by a tall, thin man and within the package was the dog tags of the slain Guardsman Katzeed. Katzeed had been a member of the Eighty-First Tarradis, the same regiment that Ngiri's Acolyte, Aberfell Duscaris belonged to. Duscaris explained that they both had been part of a Kill Team sent to kill an Ork Warboss called the Manchewer, while their regiment battled the Ork's horde. While they had succeeded only Duscaris had survived. Also included in the package was a slip of paper containing the signature of Phinius Speltmann, a wealthy recluse and member of the City's Merchant's Guild. Ngiri ordered Duscaris to investigate the matter, with the majority of her retinue, while she further studied the Blade of Saint Aruba and spoke to Verbaden City's Governor, Steban.

Helican Subsector	The Helican Subsector is a subsector of Imperial space, located in the Scarus Sector in Segmentum Obscurus.[1a] It is an old and very important part of the Sector, as both a cultural and spiritual centre. It has been determined that many chaos cults have found refuge in this subsector, which has brought down the ever vigilant eye of the Ordo Hereticus.[Needs Citation] The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Officio Assassinorum	"For those that defy the Imperium, only the Emperor can judge your crimes.Only in death can you receive the Emperor's judgement."- Motto of the Officio Assassinorum The Officio Assassinorum (Office of Assassins) is a subdivision of the Administratum responsible for the recruitment, training, and deployment of elite assassins. The Officio's head is the Grand Master of Assassins and due to the power of his organisation, and by tradition, he is always a member of the Senatorum Imperialis. Although the Grand Master oversees the organisation, they may only deploy assassins with the authority of the Senatorum, requiring a two-thirds majority of the High Lords to authorise the deployment of a single assassin.
Mendikoff	Mendikoff is an Inquisitor who wrote a detailed monograph called the Cataphract of Death, which related the early life of the Primarch Mortarion before he joined the Emperor's Great Crusade.
Gholic Ren-Sar Valinov	Gholic Ren-Sar Valinov was an Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus who fell to Chaos. Little is known about Valinov's early life as he deleted most of his history. What is known is that he was from the Segmentum Solar. He was recruited into the Inquisition by Inquisitor Barbillus on the planet Rhanda during a purge of naval aristocracy. He joined the Inquisitor's investigative arm. Barbillus used his skills as an arch manipulator to get information. Over the course of six years, Valinov's work led Barbillus to K'Sharr the Butcher's empire, hidden cults on Talshenn III, and pre-Imperial human tribes on Gerentulan Minor. He was elevated to Senior Interrogator just before Agnarsson's Hold. Agnarsson's Hold also claimed the life of Inquisitor Barbillus who had instructed his retinue to execute Exterminatus on the world if he did not return.[1a] Documents are sketchy about exactly when Valinov was made full Inquisitor, but doubtless it happened. He was active around Thracian Primaris during the brutal campaigns around the Eye of Terror. He may have played a part in subjugation of a Chaos-infected species discovered near the end of the Damocles Crusade. There is almost no data about his largest mission, to the planet of V'run.[1a]
Reynaard	Reynaard is an Ordo Xenos Inquisitor who discovered a Xenos-worshiping cult in the capital city of the Imperium world Mandall IV. The Inquisitor first thought the Xenos worshipers were localized within a particular district, but when Reynaard led a Deathwatch Kill-Team against the cult, the entire city turned upon them. After they barely escaped from the city with their lives, Reynaard gathered reinforcements and returned to Mandall IV's capital with over a half a million soldiers to dispose of the cult. At the Inquisitor's command the soldiers laid waste to the capital city and its population, ensuring that no trace of it ever existing remained.
Mattias Kuzminski	Mattias Kuzminski was a notorious Inquisitor of the Ordo Hereticus, who vaporized numerous spies and traitors to the Imperium by use of a plasma cannon..
Marchant	Marchant is a Psyker Ordo Malleus Inquisitor Lord, who was once possessed by a Daemon until he purged the warp entity from his body through fire and pain. However, this incident left Marchant hideously scarred down the left side of his body and the Inquisitor's movements are now governed entirely by a brass exoskeleton.
Nicodaemus Quixos	Nicodaemus Quixos was an Inquisitor who accompanied the First Brotherhood of the Grey Knights Chapter to Sturmhex Prime to combat the Daemon Prince Anahk'hir and the Lords of Decay. The inquisitor intentionally gave false information on the Daemon's true name to Grand Master Vardan Kai; this meant that Kai was unable to banish Anahk'hir in the battle that followed and instead had to resort to imprisoning the Daemon within a tesseract labyrinth. In the aftermath of the mission, Kai presented Nicodaemus with the labyrinth on a secret deck aboard the Grey Knights vessel Castigator, as the inquisitor had some further purpose for it. According to the journal of the Grey Knights Techmarine Aegir, Nicodaemus would eventually turn against the Imperium and be declared a traitor.
Van Dam	Van Dam was an Inquisitor in charge of an expedition to Thranx to determine why the world had ceased communication for 20 years. Van Dam was assigned by the Adeptus Terra to investigate the loss of communication and more importantly, the tithes from the Hive World of Thranx. Van Dam was in charge of a fleet of including elements from the Dark Angels, Space Wolves, Ultramarines and a Necromundan Imperial Guard Regiment. Upon arriving in system, Van Dam was able to establish communications with the Planetary Governor. The Governor offered his apologies and cited warp storms and Ork raids for the difficulties in communicating. The Governor offered to turn over the tithes immediately if Van Dam would join him on the planets surface.
Konrad Molitor	Konrad Molitor was a Radical Inquisitor. Presumed to be a member of the Ordo Xenos, Molitor broke protocol after the capture of Malahite, a member of the Glaw cabal, by beginning the interrogation without giving Gregor Eisenhorn a chance to interrogate him (as was his right as the person who captured Malahite). Eisenhorn discovered Molitor and his three henchmen stooped over a flayed Malahite, and the confrontation was ended only by Eisenhorn's unwillingness to kill another Inquisitor. When an auto-seance nearly resulted in a daemon destroying the battleship Saint Scythus Molitor was forced to reconsecrate the chapel as penance, as decreed by Inquisitor Lord Rorken. During the purge of 56-Izar Molitor revealed his dark nature by drawing his weapon on Eisenhorn and unleashing his two Arco Flagellants to attack him and steal the primer, a decoding tool needed to decipher the final copy of the Necroteuch. Molitor was killed by Eisenhorn, and his final henchmen was revealed to be the Daemonhost Cherubael. It was later revealed that Molitor was acting on behalf of his master, the renegade Inquisitor Quixos.
Mandall IV	Mandall IV is an Imperium world whose capital city was completely destroyed by over a half a million soldiers led by the Ordo Xenos Inquisitor Reynaard after the Inquisitor discovered its entire population was involved in a Xenos-worshiping cult.
Vandis	Gregor Vandis was the former governor of Meridian, in Subsector Aurelia. A typical Imperial Commander, Vandis was indolent and corrupt. During his governorship, the Blood Ravens Strike Cruiser Armageddon arrived at Meridian. Sergeant Aramus urgently requested access to the forge world's manufactories, to create weapons necessary to combat the Tyranid Hive Fleet overrunning the sector. Vandis detailed his adjutant, Elena Derosa, to deal with the Space Marines, requesting their help with dealing with Eldar raiders menacing the storehouses and estates of Meridian's nobles. Either he was unaware that the Tyranids were invading Meridian itself, or he was simply attempting to stall for time while he gathered as much of his wealth as he could and escape off-planet. When the Tyranid presence became clear, Derosa seized power from Vandis, who had already disappeared. While fighting the Eldar, Orks and Tyranids in the capital city, Sergeant Tarkus discovered a warehouse full of Vandis's "collectibles" which included several relics of the Blood Ravens chapter that had disappeared over the years.
Sophia Vilimas	Sophia Vilimas is an Inquisitor who, with the aid of the Masque of the Midnight Sorrow, defeated the Alpha Legion's forces on Safehaven and prevented a massive Daemonic incursion from occurring there. Afterwards, however, the conclave of Shadowseers who had led the Masque in the battle informed the Inquisitor that she now owed them a debt - one they will come to collect soon.
Cult	Cult is a term referring to a religious group, whether dominant in a society (such as the Imperial Cult or the Cult Mechanicus), or more subversive in nature - some influenced or dominated by hostile aliens while others are worshippers of Chaos:
Zane Tokari	Zane Tokari was a cleric serving in the Calixis Sector, when he was inducted into the Ordo Calixis as an Acolyte. He served well rising to become an Interrogator, before eventually being elevated to the rank of an Inquisitor.
Tome of Vethric	The Tome of Vethric is a tome of the Ordo Xenos. First inscribed by the famed Inquisitor Macavius Vethric, this book contains the record of every alien encountered by the Imperium. In the millennia since Vethric's death, the tome's contents have been annotated and expanded to the point where it now stands as the Imperium's most complete work on xenos strategy, and contains a wealth of countermeasures for even the most nefarious alien race.
Artemis	Artemis is a Space Marine of the Mortifactors Space Marine Chapter, currently serving with the Deathwatch as a Watch Captain of Talasa Prime.[6a] He developed uncanny skills for detecting the slightest hint of xenos taint and destroying any alien influence he may find. A veteran of a hundred campaigns, Artemis was recruited into the Mortifactors from barbaric nomadic tribes living on the Feral World of Posul a century before joining the Deathwatch. As a youth, Artemis was one of the greatest warriors of his tribe and paved the floor of his father's lodge with the skeletons of his slain enemies. Gaining many enemies due to his reputation, Artemis was ambushed by fifty warriors from an enemy tribe. Succeeding in killing them all, he nonetheless took heavy wounds and was only saved by the Chaplains of the Mortifactors. Recognized for his strength, he was healed by the Chapter's Apothecaries and began the process of being transformed into a Space Marine. As a full battle-brother, Artemis quickly distinguished himself and showed great talent in the art of xenos slaying. Such were his skills that he became recognized by the Ordo Xenos, which asked to recruit him into the Deathwatch. Artemis accepted the call and served first under Inquisitor Severnius against Genestealer cults on the Missionary World of St. Capilene, helping save the planet from falling under Tyranid domination. Inquisitor Severnius praised Artemis, promoting him as second-in-command of his kill-team. For two decades he fought alongside Severnius, rooting out alien corruption wherever it may be found. On Varnix Prime, he thwarted a Hrud attempt to capture an Adeptus Mechanicus base and while on the Agri-World of Tarrenhorst he and Severnius discovered an infestation of Warp entities that enslaved entire populations psychically.
A Treatise on the Shield that Slays	A Treatise on the Shield that Slays was a text written by Inquisitor Ishmael on the subject of the Deathwatch.
Nightfall on Stygies (Short Story)	Nightfall on Stygies is an Adeptus Mechanicus short story by Stark Holborn. It was initially released as an eShort during The Cult Mechanicus 2025 eShort Week in May 2025. The controversial Magos Explorator Isonovere Holt returns to Stygies VIII with a mysterious xenos artefact in tow, and the Inquisition in hot pursuit. Holt persuades a former acolyte, tech-adept Thess 4/90, to work with them again – can they reveal the artefact's dark secrets together?
Port Wander	Port Wander is an Imperial Space Station orbiting on the border of the Drusus Marches. It is the last stop before the Halo Worlds.[1c] Port Wander was founded in 917.M40 as a point of departure for investigations about vessels lost on the Drusus Marches' fringes and as a base for military operations. It became important after the discovery of the Koronus Passage in the late 40th millennium and it lost its military role taking up one of merchant outpost.[1c] In 422.M41, Port Wander was attacked by a Waaagh! led by an Ork named Gulgrog. Due to the limited knowledge of the area and the authorities' lack of interest in rumours about incoming Orks, Port Wander was found unprepared. When the siege proved to be inevitable, some commanders tried a last-minute escape and steadily departed from the docks. Unluckily, most of them (37 merchant haulers and transports and 12 Rogue Trader vessels) were hit by Ork raiders and frigates and faced wreckage. After this first battle, bulkier Ork Kroozers headed towards the port, but its defences stopped them.[3a]
Meridian	Meridian is the capital world of Subsector Aurelia, and is, along with Calderis, Typhon Primaris, and Aurelia, under the protection of the Blood Ravens Space Marine Chapter. Its Aestimare is A431. A Hive World, Meridian's surface is a teeming planetary metropolis, with huge city-spires rising from urban landscapes the size of continents. The planet is also an industrial power, producing everything from household goods to lasguns and aircraft.[Needs Citation] Meridian accounts for well over 90% of the total population and economic output of Subsector Aurelia. For this reason, the Governor of the sub-sector sees the other worlds under his rule as little more than a resource frontier, whereas his primary concern is Meridian's links to the larger Imperium.[Needs Citation]
Erebus	"And for all of this, I am hated. For being there at the outset, for laying the foundations that others would willingly build on. I think they wish to find something in this story that explains things - some moment of decision, some choice that could later be regretted or accounted for. But it's just as I said - none exists. I have always been on this road, never turning never deviating. A long time ago, aware of my limitations, I formulated an expression to capture my condition: blessed is the mind too small to doubt." Erebus is one of the most prominent members of the Word Bearers Chaos Space Marines and a member of the Dark Council of Sicarus. He was the harbinger of the Horus Heresy, instrumental in converting first Lorgar and then Horus to Chaos.[4a] Erebus refers to himself as Destiny's Hand, the mortal instrument of the plans of the Ruinous Powers.[6a] The boy that would become Erebus was born to common parents on Colchis and even at a young age felt it was his purpose to manipulate, deceive, and sow discord. He felt a thrill testing his own limits in these acts, which in its earliest form manifested as him teasing desert scorpions. His parents often scolded him for his poor behavior and lack of achievement, comparing him to his village's pride: a religious and studious child named Erebus. Taking his parents advice to be more like Erebus to heart, the boy strangled him with a garrote and replicated Erebus' facial tattoos. Taking the identify of Erebus for himself, the boy departed his village and became a aspiring priest for the Covenant of Colchis in the city of Vharedesh. Erebus cared little for his studies at first, but gradually began to appreciate their meanings. One day he saw his face reflected into four parts within a cracked mirror, and realized that the Ruinous Powers had always been with him and guided his actions. Erebus became a devout child of Chaos thereafter, mastering the Old Faith of Colchis which, in truth, was just an aspect of Chaos worship. When the Covenant of Colchis fell at the hands of Lorgar and his followers Erebus went into hiding for a time before reemerging as an acolyte of the Primarch.
Vinculus Crusade	The Vinculus Crusade was declared against the assassin-cult of the Peleregon cluster in 833.M41. The Black Templars under command of Marshal Ludoldus agreed to fight alongside the troops of Inquisitor Vinculus, a member of the Ordo Hereticus. Together with the Inquisitor and a detachment of Sisters of Battle of the Order of the Bloody Rose, they engaged the cult on Peleregon IV. The landing met little opposition and the Black Templars (including the then still Neophyte, Helbrecht) and the Adepta Sororitas pushed the cult members back to their mountain stronghold. During the battle, Inquisitor Vinculus confronted the cult leader and killed him. Unfortunately, the daemonic presence that was building in the cult leader manifested itself and possessed the Inquisitor who was weakened by the injuries sustained during his battle with the cult leader.
Marguerethe Wienand	Marguerethe A. Wienand was the Inquisitorial Representative to the High Lords of Terra in mid-M32. A shrewd and capable woman, Wienand was part of a faction on the Senatorum that opposed Lord High Admiral Lansung and was somewhat close to Grand Master of Assassins Drakan Vangorich.[1a] She had a romantic relationship with her female Acolyte and bodyguard, Rendenstein.[3a] During the War of the Beast, Wienand became aware of the threat posed by The Beast before any of the other High Lords and after allying with Vangorich managed to organize the first response to the Greenskins on Ardamantua.[1b] Wienand may not be as loyal to Vangorich as she seems, as she sent her bodyguard to trail Drakan's agent Esad Wire.[1c] She was later seen using a body double to appear at a meeting of the High Lords while she spied on Vangorich herself. Whatever her designs for Vangorich originally were, Wienand ultimately was forced to become dependent on the Grand Master in a power struggle with Lord Inquisitor Veritus. During a conclave, Veritus accused Wienand of having become corrupted by the High Lords.

Amberley Vail	"Some Inquisitors believe the Emperor’s work is best done by charging around the place like a grox in a ceramic emporium, leaving a trail of carnage and destruction in their wake, while others prefer not to let the enemies of all that’s good and holy get clean away by making it blindingly obvious they’re coming for them."- Amberley Vail, Inquisitor, Ordo Xenos.[3a] Amberley Vail is an active Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos in the year 999.M41[Needs Citation] and lives until at least 127.M42.[4a] In addition to her labors on behalf of the Imperium, she worked many times with the famous Commissar Ciaphas Cain, and edited Cain's private memoirs, the Cain Archive.

Genestealers have infested the planet Ma'Caellia, and the player's forces are ordered to destroy the aliens' Hive Mind. However, there are too many Genestealers, and the Marines are forced to withdraw. Without any other options, the Marines performed an Exterminatus on the planet using virus bombs. As they are doing so, the Sin of Damnation re-enters the system, and the player receives orders to invade the hulk. Aboard the vessel, the player's squads destroy the Genestealers' gene banks and their Patriarch.

It is part of the greater Pariah Crusade.[1a] It was spearheaded by High Field Marshal Janred Remko Hynflaager's Task Force XI and was tasked with destroying the Noctilith Pylons within the System.[1a] The Argovon System lies in the southern region of the Pariah Nexus and was a target by the Indomitus Crusades Battle Group Kallides. Once entering the Nexus, the Imperials were wracked by feelings of paranoia, exhaustion, and lethargy that has since become known as "The Shattering". The only known safeguard to this effect was faith in the Emperor. Despite much suffering, the Imperials scored a number of victories at the Battle of the Gates, the Death March of Paradyce II, and the Vie Almnus Counter-Push. Groupmaster Marran planned for a wider reconquest of the wider Pariah Nexus, intending to advance methodically through the region and not commit significant drives unless he could be sure systems and worlds to their rear were purged of the Necrons.[1a]
Kavator	Kavator was a Chaos Lord who led his Warband to a mining camp on the Imperium world Karis Cephalon, after he had been repeatedly plagued by Warp dreams that promised him he would find something of great power there. Once the Warband found the mining camp, they easily overwhelmed the Imperial Guard garrison stationed there and began interrogating the survivors they had captured. From the quivering wretches, they learned that Kavator's dreams were correct and something ancient and evil had been discovered in the camps mines; something that had caused three Inquisitors sent to investigate it to disappear. Before Kavator could locate the object, though, the Warband was attacked by an Imperial Guard force led by the Inquisitor Lord Nikolai Ymerich. Unbeknownst to Kavator, the Inquisitor had been tracking the Chaos Lord's Warband for some time and was determined to end their threat to the Imperium. The battle that ensued in the mining camp was brutal, but when it finally ended the Inquisitor Lord and his entire force lay dead. However Kavator himself was also killed and the object that had driven him to Karis Cephalon fell from his grasp, as his soul was sent spinning into the Warp.
Auros Varashev	Auros Varashev was a famed Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus, serving in the Calixis Sector. While purging a Pilgrims of Hayte cult on the planet Prol VI, he was killed by its leader the False Prophet Lady Solace, as she made her escape from his forces.

This led her to infiltrate Castle Grimheart, the palace of Governor-King Archimayn XII, to confront his court magister, Bargo Xathus. Min suspected Xathus was a member of the Cult and the Inquisitor killed him during their confrontation. Soon afterwards, however, the Ordo Xenos Inquisitor Loramon Valir arrived and told her the magister was his jurisdiction; he explained that Xathus was a member of the Order of the Wyrm, which Valir had just found evidence was secretly a Genestealer Cult. With his explanation done, Min then exposed a Chaos symbol on Xathus' body. Thus it was revealed that there was both a Genestealer and Chaos Cult active on Gorgomire. The two Cults, though, were now at war with each other and Min and Valir decided to work together to destroy them both.

Sturmhex (Short Story)	Sturmhex is a short story by E.J.Davies, first published in the Black Library anthology On Wings of Blood in August 2019. It is the first Warhammer story by E.J.Davies. Rare indeed are the times when an entire Brotherhood of Grey Knights fights together – but now the entire First Brotherhood gathers for a headlong assault against a growing daemonic threat on Sturmhex. Aegir and his fellow Techmarines pilot the Stormravens that will drop their brothers in the midst of battle – but when the tide of war changes and the daemon prince Anahk'hir's plan is revealed, they must adapt to survive and bring an end to the terror of Sturmhex. After being let out of the Tesseract labyrinth by the traitor Inquisitor Nicodaemus Quixos Daemon Prince Anahk'hir, first he promised The Despoiler to capture Sturmhex Prime as a foothold in Materium from which he could launch his Black Crusade, planning to use the dying star Sturmhex to open a rift into the Warp. Lords of Decay then perform a summoning ritual on Sturmhex Prime. This caught the attention of the entire First Brotherhood, who went into subterranean tunnels to fight Heretics. Anahk'hir, however, had planned for this, hoping to exact revenge on the Grey Knight who had banished him in their last encounter. Seeking to draw the Grey Knights commander onto the battlefield, Anahk'hir unleashed a flight of Heldrakes, which wreaked havoc on the Stormraven squadron. Grand Master Kai and his Honour Guard took to the field and attempted to banish the Daemon Prince by invoking his True Name, only to have no effect, as the Inquisitor who accompanied the strike force had lied to Kai and not supplied him with the correct name. He hoped to capture the Daemon rather than destroy it. Kai was instead forced into a duel against Anahk'hir until he was able to receive support from the surviving Stormravens, which had defeated the Heldrakes and regrouped. In the wake of Anahk'hir's capture, the Lords of Decay were swiftly defeated by the space marines. Roga was killed, and the tesseract was brought to Inquisitor. Quixos, who was later declared a traitor by then, was sentenced to be captured, tortured for confession, and killed. for his part in the Sturmhex Incident.
Hoth	Hoth was an Inquisitor, who wrote the Second Book of Admonitions and was an expert on the Necrons. He extolled that the greatest threat to the Imperium, lay in those known only as the Ancients. In late M41, Hoth was one of the Inquisitors assigned to analyse the aftermath of the Massacre at Sanctuary 101. He had the corpses of the Adepta Sororitas who had died in the attack removed for study and, as of 909.M41, had still not returned the bodies to their Order.
Malordnu	Malordnu is an Inquisitor, whose attention was drawn to the activities of the Rogue Trader Daskon Holpstein, which led him to quarantine Daskon's ship, the Prince Yuten. The Inquisitor then psychically tested all of the ship's crew and this led to the discovery of the crew-member Umberco Eto's, psychic potential. Malordnu had Eto taken to a Black Ship for further evaluation, which began a long path that ended with Eto eventually becoming an Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus.
Lornas Welt	Lornas Welt was an Inquisitor, who was among the Ordos' forces investigating Gereon's Until region, during the Sabbat Worlds Crusade, in the hopes of finding a medical cure for the taint of Chaos.
Jhovus Theon	Jhovus Theon was an Inquisitor who was known as a firebrand Puritan until he fell under the influence of Daemons and soon turned to Heresy. He later joined Dark Apostles of the Word Bearers in triggering a full scale Daemonic incursion on the planet Azoth. When word of his actions reached Theon's former peers in the Inquisition, they petitioned the Revilers Chapter for aid and the Space Marines landed upon Azoth in 999.M37 and began purging all life from its surface. Inquisitor Theon was killed in the attack and though the Revilers paid a heavy price in lives to do so, they successfully completed their purge. The surviving Revilers from the attack on Azoth were then subjected to mnemonic purgation, so that Inquisitor Theon's sins were expunged from the annals of the Imperium for all time. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Liszt Vandevern	Liszt Vandevern is an Ordo Hereticus Inquisitor and was a mentor to Obodiah Roth, who once served as Vandevern's Interrogator. He was a prolific field Inquisitor, who believed a raid would always reap more answers than clinical investigation. Because of this, Obodiah Roth had fought with half a dozen Heretic Cults, and even besieged the compound of a Narco-baron on Sans Gaviria before his 30th year. Sometime later in 866.M41, Roth would go on to become an Inquisitor himself.
Neve	Neve was a Cadian Puritan Inquisitor General, who was stationed on the famed Fortress World and her superior was the Grandmaster Numthun.[1a] Inquisitor Eisenhorn sought her help during his investigation into the Cadian Chaos Cult known as the Sons of Bael, but she was very dismissive, stern and distrusting of adventuring Inquisitors, like him. It took Eisenhorn some effort to convince Neve of the seriousness of his investigation and she would then aid him, in discovering that the Cult was connected to a series of classified unauthorized landings on the fortress world. When they learned that the fallen Inquisitor Quixos was behind the landings, they gathered their forces[1a] and confronted the Sons of Bael. In the battle that followed, the Cult was destroyed, but Quixos' Daemonhost Prophaniti then attacked the Inquisitors and their forces before it escaped[1b], leaving Neve gravely wounded. When Eisenhorn was later investigated by the Inquisition due to claims of Heresy, Neve tasked her subordinate Inquisitor Raum Grumman, to act as her proxy in the matter.[1a]
Kartha Vakir	Kartha Vakir is a psyker and Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus.

Anneth Vestrix	Anneth Vestrix is an Inquisitor who had Necromunda's Hive Secundus destroyed, after its Cult of the Second Son Genestealer Cult infestation became a threat to the Hive World. She had this done with Necromunda's Eye of Selene Space Station, as the Inquisitor had decided that the Hive World was too precious to the Imperium to use an Exterminatus to do so. Once Hive Secundus was destroyed, Necromunda was declared to be free of Genestealers and Vestrix left the Hive World. This was later proven to be untrue, though, as not only did the Cult of the Second Son survive, but the weapons used to destroy the Hive had given rise to the Malstrain Genestealers which now dwelled in Secundus' ruins. While this was eventually discovered by the ruling Imperial House Helmawr, it was decided to keep the infestation a secret from the Imperium, rather than risk that an Exterminatus would be reconsidered to deal with the threat.
Hammer and Bolter 10	Hammer and Bolter issue 10 was released in August 2011.
Van Hinkle	Van Hinkle was an Inquisitor Lord and known Revivificator. He wrote the treatise, Soultheft Methods of Eldar Pirates in the late 39th Millennium, with information gathered from interrogations conducted on a captured Dark Eldar.
Tartarus	Tartarus was a planet which, at one point, had five different forces clashing on the planet: Orks of the Blood Axes, Imperial Guard, Chaos Space Marines of the Alpha Legion, Eldar of the Biel-Tan Craftworld, and Space Marines of the Blood Ravens Chapter. Tartarus was settled early by humanity, and evidence has been found of a small human colony on the world, roughly around the time of the Great Crusade. However, a Daemon Prince emerged from the Warp in the vicinity of Tartarus every three thousand years, the last time in M38, and seduced the whole population to Chaos.[2a] In response, Farseer Macha of Biel-Tan arrived with an army. In the ensuing fight, the Eldar Guardians had the task of holding back the cultist forces and Bloodletter daemons, as Macha held a warp storm at bay and the Biel Tan Avatar of Khaine fought the Daemon Prince. The Eldar were victorious, but at the cost of their Avatar. Macha trapped the Daemon in a stone called the Maledictum, then buried it. To be certain that the stone could not fall into the wrong hands, the location could only be told through a series of riddles and clues.[2a]
Zaranchek Xanthus	Zaranchek Xanthus was an agent of Malcador the Sigillite during the Horus Heresy.[3a] One of the Chosen of Malcador, he was one of the individuals that the Sigillite telepathically passed on key information to before he ascended the Golden Throne. This included the file dubbed Terminus, which was given to him by Khalid Hassan and dealt with the anti-Astartes weapon of Basilio Fo. Viewing the weapon as belonging to the Chosen as opposed to the Custodes, Xanthus recruited Andromeda-17 and together they were able to temporarily gain custody of Fo alongside his warden Amon Tauromachian. The Custodian agrees to work with Xanthus and Andromeda until the authority of the prisoners custody can be confirmed.[4b] Fo, Amon, Xanthus, and Andromeda-17 next journeyed to the Sigillite's Retreat to use Malcador's lab to create a perfected version of his bio-weapon that had no chance of mutating to also infect non-Astartes. While watching over Fo, Xanthus was attacked by the mad scientist and grievously wounded. While Fo was seemingly killed by Amon Tauromachian[5a] in truth Fo was able to clone Xanthus and inhabit his body, burning the original. Now with a new identity, Fo/Xanthus began to collect Malcador's research materials.[5b]

Marabas	Marabas is a Lord of Change, a Greater Daemon of Tzeentch. First encountered among the Inquisitors of the Ordo Malleus operating in the Calixis Sector, Marabas is a master of manipulation and schemeing. Manipulating worlds of the Calixis Sector to rebel against the Imperium, his agents spread chaos until the Daemon himself was banished to the Warp for a thousand years by the Daemonhunter Zaalin. During his centuries in exile, the Daemon has nursed a great grudge against those responsible for its banishment and seeks vengeance against the whole Calixis Sector to feed its thirst for vengeance.
Damocles Squad	Damocles Squad is a Notable Squad of the Iron Snakes Space Marine Chapter. A highly distinguished unit, they are chiefly known for their actions under the leadership of Brother-Sergeant Priad. Most of the squad's known history occurs under the leadership of Priad. His predecessor, Raphon, died in action on the world of Rosetta, having already selected Priad as his replacement[1c]. During the action on Rosetta, five years into Priad's tenure as a member of Damocles, the squad fought Chaos Cultists and Traitor Marines and lost three of their number in total. Their next known undertaking was as part of a six-squad force sent to free the world of Eidon from Dark Eldar predation. During the liberation of Eidon City, Damocles squad won great renown by defeating great numbers of the enemy in a single action, a number reckoned to be "A thousand over and again"[1v]. Four years after becoming Squad-Sergeant, Priad led Damocles into action of the Agri World of Ceres, as part of a four-squad undertaking requested by Inquisitor Mabuse. Damocles hunted down and eliminated a nest of Chaos worshipers, including besting a daemon. The undertaking cost them dear, however, with three of their number being killed in action, including Apothecary Memnes[1h] Almost immediately afterward, the squad once again faced Chaos predation; this time it was inside their own Fortress Monastery. Another undertaking against the Chaotic powers had resulted in the almost-total destruction of Ridates Squad, and the return of a secretly possessed member of Thebes Squad. Priad was able to track down the daemon and ensure it's destruction, as well as secure new recruits for his squad, including Apothecary Khiron.[1m]
Nachmund Rift War	The Nachmund Rift War is an ongoing conflict being waged by the Imperium in the Nachmund Sub-Sector.[1a] Closely connected to the War of Beasts and War of Nightmares on Vigilus, while the Fortress World itself continues to remain largely in Imperial hands the greater Nachmund Gauntlet finds itself besieged by the Forces of Chaos.[1a] Ever since its fall to Chaos Knight forces, the reclamation of Dharrovar had become a priority to Lord Commander Roboute Guilliman. The Wardens of the Gauntlet answered the call to arms, though their brotherhood was overstretched from the war on Vigilus. They were joined by forces of Battle Sisters, Imperial Guard, Knights, and Imperial Navy warships. But even with this imposing army, besieging Dharrovar would prove difficult.[1a]
Deathwing (Short Story)	Deathwing is a short story by Bryan Ansell and William King. It was the first published story in the anthology of the same name, first published in 1990, making it one of the earliest short stories published in the Warhammer 40,000 universe. It was re-published in the 2001 re-release of Deathwing, as well as in The Book of the Lion (Anthology). Dark Angels Sergeant Ezekiel returns to his home world to recruit new battle-brothers for the Chapter, but finds his people dead and their villages burned. Discovering an insidious alien threat behind the destruction, Ezekiel reclaims his birth-name of Cloud Runner and undergoes the Rite of the Deathwing, beginning a crusade that will leave a mark on the history of the Dark Angels Chapter. Two centuries after he joined the Dark Angels, Cloud Runner and his fellow Deathwing Marines arrive at his former village only to find it a deserted ruin. They soon discover a vast industrial city on a nearby plain. Librarian Two Heads Talking enters the city after assuming a psychic disguise. There he finds the descendants of the Plains people have been reduced to a servile and downtrodden mass of factory workers slaving away for their overlords.
Eyrian Arena Massacre	The Eyrian Arena Massacre is an event in which servitors summoned of a Khorne Daemon The Eyrian Arena Massacre was an event that involved eight servitors summoning a Khorne Daemon. The Khorne Daemon dismembered the sevitors and took their skulls as trophies. Inquisitor Leshra was present at the event and later wrote a transcription of the events.
Citadel Combat Cards	The Citadel Combat Cards are a family of card games that were released by Games Workshop between 1988 and 2017. Originally in 1988 six different card decks with 35 cards each (plus rules and cover card) were released - four of them set in the Warhammer Fantasy universe (Warriors, Goblinoids, Dwarfs, Monsters) and two (Spacewar and Chaos) in the Warhammer 40,000 universe (the latter could possibly also be set in Fantasy as this is not clear from the miniatures pictured and many miniatures could be used in either universe). Each full-colour playing card features a photograph of Citadel Miniatures. Each set includes a fast playing set of standard rules that was printed onto the back of the blister the set was sold in (see below) plus a different bonus game in every pack (i.e. printed onto an extra card in the pack) and could be played on its own or with the other packs. The bonus game was also referred to as "Advanced Game". The games were designed for 2+ players.
Xenos Horrificus	Xenos Horrificus is the Ordo Xenos' classification for alien races deemed hostile or dangerous to mankind, and in need of extermination. Whilst all aliens are deemed anathema to the Imperium, some of their kind are tolerated to a degree, with such species being either primitive in technology and culture or being in a backwater region of space. On many worlds, contact with xenos is not uncommon and frontier worlds have trade with such beings, which is overlooked by authorities and not worthy of censure or intervention. However, there exist a number of alien races who are such a threat to Mankind that they are branded as Xenos Horrificus, prompting active campaigns to hunt down and exterminate them. This brand does not apply solely to the xenos themselves, but all who associate with them.
Pontius Glaw	Pontius Glaw was a scion of House Glaw, one of the noble Houses of Gudrun, and later one of the most notorious heretics in the Imperium. Pontius was born around 993.M40, the seventh son of the Glaw patriarch, Lord Oberon Glaw. As the seventh son, Pontius was denied access to the lion's share of his family's power and wealth, which was pieced out among his elder brothers. Left to his own devices, Pontius indulged himself in gambling and debauchery. Despite his keen intellect, cultured views, natural charisma, and a fine education, Pontius eventually became corpulent with excess. His early life, as well as his later infamies, were required reading for Inquisitors in training, a stern lesson against wasting one's natural advantages on self-indulgence.[1a] Many persons theorised that Pontius turned to Chaos in his late forties, seeking a way to restore the fortune and health that he had so foolishly wasted; yet even his more innocuous actions in his pre-Chaotic youth were tainted by brutality and ruthlessness: he made large sums of money by buying Pit Slaves and staging exhibitions famous for their cruelty[1a]

Gerome Thrax	Gerome Thrax was an Ordo Malleus Inquisitor Ordinary, who once served as an Interrogator to the legendary Daemonhunter Phaust. A student of the Imperium's history, Thrax believed that Space Marines were a significant threat to Humanity, alongside heresy and the Warp. Since he was an avowed member of the Ordo Malleus, the Inquisitor made it his goal to monitor the actions of Space Marine Chapters, especially those who purported to keep the Imperium's borders safe. Thrax, however, would mainly keep his scrutinizing gaze on those Chapters that were operating within the Segmentums Solar and Tempestus. Regardless of their location, though, the Inquisitor would use his power to take action against those he believed were threats. As a result of this, Thrax took a number of Space Marines he considered to be Heretics into his custody and subjected them to repeated psychic scourges and brutal mindtrawls within his remote Inquisitorial watch station. Even if his tests proved they were innocent of his charges, though, Thrax would refuse to believe the results. Instead, the Space Marines would be returned to their Stasis Cells aboard the station, where they would remain until the Inquisitor decided to prove their guilt again by subjecting them to his tests once more. Thrax's gaze would later fall upon the Ultramarines Captain Demetrian Titus, during the Graia Invasion. By then, Thrax had over four hundred years of service and he ignored Graia's plight at first, when it involved Orks and the unblemished Ultramarines Chapter. It was not until Inquisitor's agents learned that the Chaos Lord Nemeroth had invaded the Forge World, that Thrax decided to get involved. After his arrival, though, the Inquisitor was contacted by the Ultramarine Leandros, who served in Captain Titus' Command Squad. According to Leandros, as Titus led the Ultramarines' 2nd Company against the invaders, the Captain had been repeatedly exposed to the Warp power source of the Psychic Scourge weapon, developed by Inquisitor Drogan. However, despite this, Titus miraculously emerged completely unharmed by the power source each time. Drogan was also revealed to have been possessed by a Daemon that served the Chaos Lord Nemeroth the entire time, that Titus had interacted with him. This led the Captain to be confronted by Thrax, after Graia had just been saved due to Titus' actions. Once he is faced with the Inquisitor's accusations of heresy, the Captain decides to surrender himself to Thrax, rather than resist. In this way, Titus ensures that the 2nd Company and the 203rd Cadian Regiment that had aided them, are free from the Inquisition's wrath for being affiliated with a potential heretic. Thrax would then order that Graia be quarantined due to the nature of its invaders and then departed from the world with Titus.
Hargen (Inquisitor)	Lord Hargen is an Inquisitor.
Anton Zerbe	Anton Zerbe is a Lord Inquisitor of the Ordo Hereticus.[1a] Commanding the Tyrantine Cabal of Inquisitors in the Calixis Sector, he is known to rarely leave the Bastion Serpentis in order to frequently chair Inquisition meetings. Zerbe once roamed the Imperium to seek out corruption and incompetence among the Adeptus Terra but now is dedicated to his current role. Even to a fault, his principal motivation is preventing strife within the Inquisition's ranks in the Calixis Sector. As a result he is sternly against the factionalism that plagues the Inquisition, particularly against the Recongregators, Xanthites, and Amalathians. However, he is distant, and is not approachable to even his colleagues. Ultimately he tries to prevent any of these factions from becoming dominant in order to avoid all-out chaos. A powerful Psyker, he is never seen without his golden mask and gilded armour.[1e]
Thassian	Thassian is a Radical Inquisitor, who ordered his retinue to attack the Black Ship Aegis of Truth, in order to steal its cargo of Psykers. The attack was successfully led by the Inquisitor's Interrogator Osmun, who scuttled the Black Ship after removing 33 captured Psykers from its hold. Osmun is now traveling to Hydrae-Delphi, so phase two of Thassian's plan for the psykers can begin.
Grunwald	Grunwald may refer to:
Kuryakin	Kuryakin was an Inquisitor of the Ordo Hereticus as of late M41 or early M42. In the course of the Valhallan 597th's campaign on Simia Orichalcae, Commissar Ciaphas Cain suspected that the Adeptus Mechanicus had deliberately located a promethium refinery over the site of a Necron Tomb, in the hopes of investigating its technology. Amberley Vail of the Ordo Xenos, editing Cain's memoirs, noted that subsequent investigation had failed to discover concrete evidence of the conspiracy, but Inquisitor Kuryakin would welcome any pertinent information. This suggests that Kuryakin's particular purview or interest was investigating aberrations or threats from the Mechanicus.
Tyrannic Wars	The Tyrannic Wars are a series of conflicts fought primarily by the Imperium against Tyranid Hive Fleets, beginning in late M41. Collectively, the Tyrannic Wars have seen a massive mobilization of Imperial forces and is among the highest prioritized conflicts in the Imperium. Deployed primarily to the Eastern Fringe, casualties among Imperial Guard Regiments have been so high that it seems as if the Tyranids are annihilating them faster than they can be deployed. Over the course of the Tyrannic Wars, many minor races have been rendered extinct and thousands of planets have been reduced to lifeless husks. The First Tyrannic War (745.M41): The Imperium makes first contact with the Tyranid race when Hive Fleet Behemoth invades the Eastern Fringe and annihilates planet Tyran; Behemoth is defeated, though at great cost, by the Ultramarines at the Battle for Macragge. The Second Tyrannic War (990-993.M41): Hive Fleet Kraken invades and is, again, narrowly defeated.
Caligari Conclave	The Caligari Conclave is an Inquisition Conclave that is charged with watching over the blighted Caligari Sector. The Conclave's main stronghold was the Tempestus Citadel.
Goreden	Sweet merciful Emperor, the secrets of the Black Library unlocked by the sorcerer of the Red Cyclops! Better that Czevak has perished to some foul xeno creature than fall into his clutches. I shall mobilise the 34th Gudrunite Rifles and petition the Chapter Master of the Iron Hands for his warriors' aid. I pray I am not too late. - Lord Inquisitor Goreden Lord Inquisitor Goreden (or Goredon) is an Amalathian Ordo Xenos Inquisitor Lord, who is based on Nemesis Tessera.[2a] After leaving the Black Library for the first time, in the opening days of the 13th Black Crusade, Radical Inquisitor Bronislaw Czevak sent dictats to many minor worlds, including Har and Ryanti, pretending to hold conclaves there in an attempt to attact the Chaos Cultists and the Witchhunters of the Ordo Hereticus that were after him.[2a][2b] This misinformation campaign was also calculated to appease the more moderate Radicals and Puritans, which would in turn abate Goreden and the other Amalathians, such as Inquisitor Grand Master Ephisto Specht.[2a]
Ebron Valdermar	Ebron Valdermar is an Inquisitor and among the forces he commands is the Stormraven Sword of the Emperor, which serves as his personal transport. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here. Ebron Valdermar and the Sword of the Emperor were created by the Games Workshop employee Mick Cudworth and they were featured in Warhammer: Visions 12.
Horst	Inquisitor Horst was born on a planet ruled by an evil Overlord named Alaine de Briant. At an early age he joined a freedom fighter group, quickly rising through the ranks to become their leader as his extraordinary fighting ability showed itself in many battles. He was not just a good fighter, but had excellent oratory skills as well as great charm, and using these traits he united the rebel factions that were fighting against the Overlord. He fought a brilliant guerrilla campaign against the overlord and eventually, against all the odds, he overthrew the Overlord after almost thirty years of bitter warfare. When news of his work reached the Administratum, he was quickly inducted into the Inquisition, at a relatively late age.
Callius Marloff	"Ours is not a universe of poetry, but one of song: the sorrowful lament of the dying, lilting on the breath of ancient gods"Inquisitor Callius Marloff, The Book of Endings, date unknown Callius Marloff is an Inquisitor, who is quoted in The Book of Endings.
Gorman	Gorman is an Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos who commanded the Blood Raven Barnabus, during his time with the Deathwatch.
Bastalek Grim	Bastalek Grim was an Inquisitor. In 741.M41 he traveled to Fenris and attended the Great Feast of Gerrod Redbeard, committing the sagas recited there to his eidetic implants. These sagas were re-recorded into Imperial records through Grim's treatise The War of the Giants. He also searched for the enigmatic Cypher, though he was unaware of Cypher's status as a Fallen Angel and connection to the Dark Angels Chapter.
Querrian	Querrian was a Radical Lord Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus who in 853.M41 unleashed Chaos against itself on the Daemon-infested world of Yaogeddon. Sven Bloodhowl's Great Company, themselves battling the Daemonic hordes on the world, are astonished when the legions of Khorne and Slaanesh turn on each other while ignoring all else. Querrian and the Wolves joined forces, defeating the chaotic horde. However, days later, Puritan Inquisitors arrived to execute Querrian for his forbidden methods. Sven Bloodhowl intervened, buying enough time for Querrian to escape.
Galbus Heer	You must face the truth squarely and without fl inching from duty. Our enemies are mortal no longer. Any glimpse of humanity they may show is merely a deception. Dedicate this weapon, given into your hand at the behest of the Emperor, to their destruction. Regard its function as your only duty: you live only to purge the Daemon. Take up your rod and staff, your armour and psycannon, and go forth.— Lectures to the Ordo, Inquisitor Galbus Heer[2a] Galbus Heer is a Ordo Malleus Inquisitor, who is known for his extensive lectures on the dangers represented by Daemons and the Warp. He is also known as Inquisitor-Historical.[2b]
Jost von Marburg	Jost von Marburg is an Ordo Xenos Inquisitor, who is an expert on Genestealers.[1a] He seeks to destroy those Xenos species that oppose the Imperium.[1b] The Space Hulk Forsaken Doom became the focus of the Inquisitor's efforts to do so, as its Genestealers infested any ship or world it came across. This led Marburg to spend decades of his life studying the Ordo Xenos' records of one of the Galaxy's most elusive and mysterious Space Hulks. It was a horror that had drifted randomly in and out of the Warp for millennia and had been the grave of countless Space Marines.[1b] Through his studies, Marburg learned of the Ultramarines[1c], Space Wolves[1d] and Dark Angels' defeats after they boarded the Space Hulk.[1e] This allowed him to discover that secretive Chapter's hunt for the Fallen Angels[1f] and that the Forsaken Doom was home to several unique species of Genestealer.[1g] Marburg was eventually able to determine where the Forsaken Doom would emerge next and now required a band of undaunted heroes that he could guide to triumph over the Space Hulk's Genestealers.[1h] This would occur in M42[1n], when the Forsaken Doom threatened to collide with the Forge World Gorgonum and the Blood Angels Captain Ubaldo came to its aid.[1i] His battered force aboard the Blood Crusader had just completed a successful campaign, though, and could only send a single Terminator Squad for the mission.[1j] However, before they could depart and begin placing a series of melta-bombs near energy cores within the Forsaken Doom[1a], Marburg appeared and made his presence known. The Inquisitor refused to explain how he knew of the Forsaken Doom's location and simply stated he was there to observe the Blood Angels' mission.[1i]
Rasputin	Rasputin was an Inquisitor. While observing the Ravenwing and Deathwing work in conjunction to capture a prisoner, Inquisitor Rasputin believed he had, at last, solved the riddle of the Dark Angels. As he turned to leave the battlefield, only his lightning-fast reflexes and a nigh-impenetrable force field allowed him to survive a flurry of shots that would have slain him. Even as a hooded figure advanced upon his position, a new conflict broke out. Ravenwing troops on bikes had picked up Cypher’s trail and pursued him as he attempted to gun down the Inquisitor before escaping. Rasputin never made his final report. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Javes Thysser	Javes Thysser was an Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos who apprehended the heretic Gaethon Richter on Vogel Passionata. Thysser's retinue was slaughtered by Gaethon's "servant," the daemonhost Cherubael, but Thysser was surprised when the daemonhost refrained from killing him. To Richter's confusion, Cherubael leaned towards Thysser and, realizing his true identity, "apologized" for the case of mistaken identity — Cherubael thought Thysser was Gregor Eisenhorn, whom Cherubael wanted alive. After apologizing, the daemonhost vanished. Thysser executed Richter, rendered helpless with confusion and dismay.[1a] Thysser was troubled by Cherubael's words, and detailed them in a report to Inquisitor Lord Rorken, the Ordo Xenos' leader in the Helican sector.[1a][1b]
The Last Crucible (Short Story)	The Last Crucible is a Inquisition short story written by Noah Van Nguyen. On the world of Eleutane, the Astra Militarum hold the line against a resurgent necron empire, awaiting reinforcement to push onwards to victory. But Inquisitor Kataryn Moloth thinks there's more at play than meets the eye. The forces arrayed on Eleutane – Elysians, Valhallans, and more – should have defeated the necrons. Treachery is afoot. Recruiting a disgraced officer to her service, Inquisitor Moloth sets out to discover the truth.
Chirurgeon	The Chirurgeon is a part-daemonic, part-technological device attached to the spine of Fabius Bile. It provides him with numerous spider-like arms which extend over his shoulders but also pumps black ichor through his body which is charged with the power of the warp and creates a protective ward around him. It has been said both that the Chirurgeon is Bile's life's work and that it works to keep Bile alive. Bile suspects that the Chirurgeon has developed a degree of sentience over his years within the Eye of Terror, and often has dreams of the device scurrying about and conducting its own activities while he slumbers. Bile also suspects at times the Chirurgeon is responsible for the many fits of pain he experiences. More recently, the Chirurgeon's level of sentience has expanded. It has become capable of moving on its own, skittering away from Bile and vanishing for days or weeks. Bile has discovered the device is now capable of producing "offspring".
Planetary Governor	An Imperial Commander, often referred to as a Governor, is a figure with (often hereditary) authority to rule a world in the Emperor's name. They are the chief overseers of Imperial worlds, although some Imperial Commanders administer not mere planets, but entire Sectors and Sub-Sectors. They have been known to come not from just nobility, but also the Imperial Guard, Space Marines and Ecclesiarchy. Naturally, since the vast and dispersed nature of Imperial territory would make a totally centralized system of government unfeasible, the Planetary Governor is given discretionary control over the administration (including governance, defence and development) of the planet in question. In theory he (or she) is duty-bound to the Adeptus Terra. Essentially though, he is an independent governor. As long as the planet's tithes, mutant and psyker "head counts" are kept under control and the planet is governed competently, he is free to run the planet however he chooses.[Needs Citation] They are expected to defend the planet in the name of Imperium, maintaining Planetary Defence Forces and orbital defences. Due to the fickle nature of the warp, communication with the Adeptus Terra is often delayed and sometimes prevented entirely. Often this means that Governors must make decisions on the defence of their world without advice and help from Terra, meaning that for the world to prosper, every Governor must be adept at military matters as well as the development of the planet's trade infrastructure.[Needs Citation]
Hyboran	Hyboran was an Ordo Xenos Inquisitor who received the aid of the Flesh Tearers Chapter in crushing the Xorln Infestation. Once the Xenos were dealt with, she gifted the boltgun Slayer's Wrath to the Flesh Tearers in gratitude for their help.
Inquisitor Conspiracies 2 - Death of an Angel	Inquisitor: Conspiracies - Death of an Angel is a second book in the Inquisitor: Conspiracies series - a supplement to the narrative skirmish game Inquisitor based on Games Workshop's Warhammer 40,000 Universe. The Mutant slaves are revolting and Karis Cephalon stands on the precipice of descending into all-out anarchy. Unknown cults begin to take full advantage of the current situation. Can the forces of the Inquisition stop these shadowy organisations before it is too late?[1c]
Masque of the Midnight Sorrow	The Masque of the Midnight Sorrow are a company of Harlequin Eldar that associate closely with the Dark Eldar and seek to combat the dangers of Chaos. Often seen amid the spires of High Commorragh, their renditions of the tale of The Fall are widely regarded amongst Commorrite high society as the pinnacle of the Harlequin's art, and their every step is perfectly choreographed to evoke the sorrow and terror of that ancient catastrophe. Indeed, the Midnight Sorrow are so committed to their performance that many of their players have, over the centuries, lost their original identities altogether. Now they walk the paths of the Webway as echoes of that terrible age - reminders of an evil so voracious that it still consumes Eldar souls to this day. Their focus on the Fall has led the Midnight Sorrow to become focused on battling all the servants of Chaos. For the Midnight Sorrow, this has become a destructive obsession where no price is to steep. The Masque stalks the Webway tunnels around the Eye of Terror, striking fearlessly at Chaos strongholds. Upon the battlefield, the Masque's warrior-acrobats move and fight with the same perfect grace that they display on stage. The Masque's name stems from the eighteenth verse of the third act of the Fall; that infamous scene wherein Cegorach witnesses the darkest time to have befallen his children. Echoing the bleak misery and clashing violence of this scene, the Midnight Sorrow will always endeavor to strike at their foes as the witching hour tolls. They strike suddenly and leave nothing but ruin and misery in their wake.
Feudal World	A μ-class, feudal world or medieval world is a classification of world existing in a technologically medieval state. The most advanced such worlds possess black powder weaponry. The tithes from these planets are slightly more than those of Feral Worlds (generally from Solutio Prima to Solutio Extremis), thanks to the development of agriculture. A feudal world typically has a population of 10,000,000 to 500,000,000 people. Feudal worlds are self-sufficient, and due to dependence on agriculture, a large part of the populations of these worlds are peasants, usually ruled by warrior aristocracies. Feudal worlds are of relatively little use to the Imperium; the true position of their place in the universe may constitute something of a culture shock to the inhabitants, making them poor material for Imperial service - although the warrior nobilities are often a source of recruits for the Space Marines.
Kadyron	Kadyron was an Inquisitor Lord who led the Kadyron Voyage into the Hazeroth Abyss. The expedition was a complete disaster that resulted in the death of the Inquisitor and the loss of all forces involved - save one Battle Barge from the Marines Errant Chapter.
Ghoul Stars	The Ghoul Stars, also known as the Ghost Stars, are a desolate region of space located in the extreme northeast of the galaxy. They consist of worlds lit by the cold rays of dying suns. It is known as a feared area of void-space located in the northern part of the Ultima Segmentum. Among the Xenos populations within this area were the Cythor Fiends along with other creatures out of primal nightmares such as Togoran Bloodreeks. Among the native inhabitants of the Ghoul Stars are creatures so alien that they seem supernatural. This region of space was once home to a number of Human inhabited worlds. However, an ancient threat is believed to be responsible for the destruction of these planets and accounted for the large number of formerly human inhabited Dead Worlds.[2b] The inhabitants of the Ghoul Stars have been described as being supernatural and pose a threat to the galaxy.[3a] Among the most horrifying of threats native to this area of space is the Necron Bone Kingdom of Drazak.
Battle barge	The Battle Barge is the largest Space Marine warship and is configured for close support of planetary landings. Battle Barges were originally a simple designation during the Great Crusade to refer to Battleships under Legiones Astartes control. Commonly though any capital class vessel used exclusively by the legion’s was often referred to as a Battle Barge regardless of the technical truth of the matter.[4a] Today, most Chapters control two or three Battle Barges designed to deploy a fighting force to planets in a rapid fashion. Each Battle Barge is capable of deploying 3 Space Marine Companies plus supplies and support. Large amounts of space are designed to hold launch bays for inter-system craft and drop pods allowing up to three Companies to deploy simultaneously. The vessel is extremely heavily armored and well-shielded for breaching planetary defences while also protecting its cargo. It is also a dangerous enemy, especially with boarding actions but also contains enough firepower to destroy all but the most powerful of warships. Battle Barges are some of the most powerful ships the Imperium has at its disposal, due to both the power of the ships and their contents. Constructed with its unique role of low-orbit planetary assault in mind, the Battle Barges' skeletons were forged from an ultra-dense alloy. The rare base mineral can only be mined from the sites of recent volcanic eruptions, and is further hardened by ballast compression tanks situated on high-gravity moons. The pressurized environment hardens the alloy, ensuring the superstructure is as solid as the doors protecting the Emperor’s throne room itself. These inner frameworks were then girded in kilometres of hardened plasteel and adamantium, and edged with thick ferrocrete buttresses that surround the main hull like a reinforced rib-cage. Finally, a second and ablative layer of armour was added to each vessel's prow, forging an impenetrable figurehead for the indomitable fury of a Battle Barge.
Fanatic Online	Fanatic Online was a free online-magazine devoted to the miniature games of Fanatic Games. It was launched in 2005 by Fanatic Press as a replacement for the printed Fanatic Magazine, and distributed digitally for the entirety of its run. It published contents such as rules and scenarios for the various Specialist Games. As with Fanatic Magazine and the magazine's individually published predecessors, Fanatic Online regularly featured articles submitted by hobbyists, and as such, their content had the potential to conflict with official background lore. Fanatic Online was cancelled in 2008 after all content related to Specialist Games was relocated to Games Workshop's official website. Articles featured in Fanatic Online discuss rules and background for the Warhammer 40,000 games of Necromunda, Inquisitor, Battlefleet Gothic, and Epic Armageddon, as well as the Warhammer Fantasy specialist games such as Blood Bowl, Mordheim, and Warmaster
Goldo	There is only one true path and that is the path of fire and pain..— Inquisitor Goldo, Monodomination: The Right of Man to Rule the Galaxy. Goldo was a Puritan Inquisitor who lived in M33. After serving the Imperium for nearly four hundred years, his final conclusion amounted to declaring that the only way the Emperor's Kingdom would survive the Galaxy was if everything else was destroyed. At the time, this overtly pessimistic view found few sympathizers and it was attributed to a psychotic breakdown. Centuries later his ideology was revitalized by Jeriminus of Paelutia, leading to the philosophy of Monodominantism.
Gorgo Tsouras	Gorgo Tsouras was an Inquisitor Lord of the Ordo Hereticus.[1a][1b] When a strike force of the Soul Drinkers Chapter led by Librarian Sarpedon went renegade, firing on an Imperial battlefleet in the Lakonia System before making their escape aboard two Strike Cruisers, the remaining functional ships of the fleet followed them, eventually cornering them in an asteroid field in a barren system. Although the Imperial fleet received reinforcements (with the operation to contain and capture the renegades now designated the Lakonia Persecution), they were unwilling to follow the Space Marines into the field due to the danger posed by the tumbling debris; thus a stalemate emerged that lasted for months. Eventually, the Inquisition, impatient and unsatisfied by the fleet's lack of progress, assumed control of the Persecution, with Inquisitor Tsouras arriving to oversee the operation personally.[1a] Tsouras sent one of his acolytes, the Interrogator K'Shuk, into the field to meet with Sarpedon. K'Shuk delivered his master's ultimatum to the Soul Drinkers - stand down and surrender themselves to the Inquisiton, or the entire Chapter would be declared Excommunicate Traitoris and exterminated. Sarpedon resisted, rejecting Tsouras's authority, and so the Soul Drinkers were condemned.[1b]
Montiyf	Montiyf is a Ordo Malleus Inquisitor. Inquisitor Montiyf once came to the planet Beltrasse to seek out the tomb of a fallen Exorcists Captain and find out what fate he had suffered. Once there it became clear that the Exorcists Captain had bound a Daemon there as his final act. The Inquisitor together with a pack of Space Wolves then banished the Daemon from the world. Alongside the Inquisitor was his Interrogator Pranix who he then recommended for promotion to full status as Inquisitor after the completion of the mission.
Necroteuch	The Necroteuch was a book of abominable evil and the subject of Inquisitorial attention.[1a] Inquisitor Gregor Eisenhorn found himself on the trail of the Necroteuch whilst investigating House Glaw and in particular Pontius Glaw. Pontius and his associates were of the belief that the Necroteuch would have power enough to raise his consciousness from the crystal it was entrapped in and create a new body. Further plans were unknown, although with such a powerful artifact it is unlikely that he would have stopped there.[1d] The Necroteuch was originally believed destroyed, as were all copies in known human space. However, an alien species called the Saruthi had acquired a copy in ages past, a copy which seeped into the unique physiology and psychology of this alien civilisation, warping it thoroughly. House Glaw felt that they could trade Saruthi artifacts for the copy of the Necroteuch and were only stopped by the combined efforts of Eisenhorn, his retinue and loyal Imperial Guard troops.[1a][1b][1c]
Iyaklyta Rehnis	Iyaklyta Rehnis was an Ordo Xenos Inquisitor who long ago sought an ancient Necron device known as the Arks of Hamenet. Despite the scepticism of her colleagues, Rehnis was certain the powerful artefact existed and was finally tipped off by Kroot that it may dwell in the Kutullos System of the Neviec Sector. Rehnis requisitioned the entire 15th Kasrkin Regiment to claim the device, but on her way back to the Ordo Xenos research station Longwatch her vessel was lost in the Warp. Eventually fragments of the ship merged with that of the Gallowdark. During the calamity, Rehnis was slain. Millennia later, the Gallowdark reemerged into realspace in the Nemesys Sector and due to the nature of time flow in the Warp the survivors of her expedition still found themselves trapped aboard the hulk. The few surviving Kasrkin took this opportunity to escape, but soon came under assault from Necrons of the Tsarakura Dynasty under Technomancer Hamanet.
Cheth	Cheth is an Imperial world. In 444.M41 the Ordo Malleus received the information that Kezidha the Eleventh — Regent of this world - was possessed by a daemon. The first Inquisitor sent here missed without trace so Inquisitor Annika Jarlsdottyr arrived on Cheth and, with the help of a squadron of Grey Knights, managed to banish the daemon, killing the Regent and all his Court in the process. Cheth also raised approximately two hundred thousand Imperial Guardsmen, known under the collective regimental name Cheth Sixteenth Rifles.
Knael	Knael is an Ordo Xenos Lord Inquisitor, who wrote A Discursive Primer for Initiates of the Ordo Xenos. In volume 1 of his work, Knael claims the void is a vast and inhuman place, that has bred creatures just as dangerous as any Daemon. However in the face of such dire knowledge, he states the Ordo Xenos must hold onto a single truth: it is Mankind's destiny to rule the stars alone.
Joffen Tur	Joffen Tur is an Inquisitor Lord of the Ordo Hereticus, who had a brusque manner and was known to cultivate making people fear him. Due to his position, Tur did not place a great deal on being courteous with those he interacted with, or even the members of his retinue. He was among those Imperial forces that took part in combating the rebellion that broke out on Forfoda, after its Planetary Governor turned upon the Imperium. Though Tur felt the matter was beneath his notice and only arrived with a small amount of his forces aboard the Leopax. The warship was amongst the smallest of those under his command and Tur chose it to signal the other Imperial forces that the rebellion was the highest of his priorities. Nonetheless, he took part in the effort to save the world and took most of his retinue to capture Forfoda's traitorous Planetary Governor, in order to learn his reasons for rebelling. Time was of the essence, as the Imperial Fists had come to Forfoda's aid and were destroying rebel-held buildings, in an attempt to end the rebellion. A squadron under the command of Chaplain Erastus, was also going to attack the rebellion's second in command, the Governor's adjutant Naiao Servia, and, in order to ensure she was brought in alive, Tur ordered that his Interrogator Luce Spinoza accompany the Imperial Fists. This was also done to strengthen Spinoza's conventional combat abilities, which he told the Interrogator she was weak in. When Tur and Spinoza began their attacks, however, they discovered that the rebellion's leadership had fallen to heresy and worshiped the Chaos God Nurgle. They now faced rebels infected with Nurgle's power, but both were victorious and brought word of the rebellion's heresy to the other Imperial forces. Spinoza was heavily wounded, though, in capturing Servia, and Tur later visited her in one of the Imperial's medicae stations on Forfoda. After learning of how she became wounded saving the life of the Chaplain Erastus, and stopped the Imperial Fists from killing Servia, was at a loss of words. Praise did not come naturally to him, and he eventually told her she did well and that he would soon interrogate Servia. After learning Spinoza was healing well, Tur left and telling his Interrogator, they would work on her weapons training once she recovered. He then interrogated the rebellion's second in command, Servia, and with the knowledge he gathered, Tur helped the Imperium's forces end the rebellion.
Lichtenstein	Lichtenstein is a renowned Radical Istvaanian Inquisitor.[2c] Having since been declared Excommunicate Traitoris, he is currently being actively hunted by one of the most renowned Witch Hunters of the Imperium, Tyrus. Lichtenstein has a single-minded obsession with the artifact known as the Liber Heresius that freed the Daemon Prince Phara'gueottla from its prison on Karis Cephalon. Since then, his fate has been inextricably tied with that of Tyrus, the Daemon, and the ex-Daemonhost known as Kessel. These three clashed on Karis over the manifestation of the Daemon Prince on the world of Paganus Reach and again at Cephalon Spaceport where Lichtenstein managed to break Kessel free from Tyrus' custody. In return, Kessel gave Lichtenstein safe passage to Equinox, a world where, under the false name of Thravian Flast, he searches tirelessly for the true location of the Liber Heresius. Now a very old man, his strength of will allows him to continue on with his mission. While many have dismissed him as mad and traitorous, he sincerely believes that he is on a quest to save mankind from enslavement at the ends of an ancient mechanical race who worship death. Since no one believes him, he has vowed to do it himself. He knows that within the Liber Heresius is a powerful weapon, proof against these ancient killing machines. Lichtenstein will do anything, including harnessing the powers of Chaos, to obtain it.
Presumptive Okonawk	Presumptive Okonawk was an Inquisitor Lord who served in the Calixis Sector. While he was a senior Acolyte under Inquisitor Lord Khazul, he lead a Cadre to the planet Acreage to conduct a mission of dire importance. There disaster struck however, as Okonawk and his Cadre were unprepared for what they faced and though Okonawk succeeded in completing the mission, one hundred thousand citizens of Acreage, as well as his entire Cadre lost their lives. When Okonawk learned from Khazul that the entire mission had been a final test to see if he had the fortitude to become an Inquisitor, he bitterly killed his erstwhile master. Later in his career, after he had become an Inquisitor Lord himself, he was denounced by an Inquisition High Conclave after being accused of Radicalism.
Leshra	Leshra is an Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus. She was present at the Eyrian Arena Massacre, during which her eight servitors completed a ritual that resulted in the summoning of a Daemon of Khorne. All eight servitors were dismembered in the summoning, and their skulls were taken as trophies by the daemon. Following the incident, Leshra recorded a full transcription of the events.
Krage	Krage was once an Inquisitor of merciless repute who wielded both a mighty mind and psychic ability — until he was captured by Abaddon the Despoiler. The Inquisitor suffered a long and painful interrogation at Abaddon's hands, before the Despoiler implanted the Butcher's Nails within Krage's skull and finally released him. The Butcher's Nails immediately wracked the Inquisitor with relentless agony, while also raising his aggression to near apoplectic levels; all of which crushed Krage's mind and prevented him from using his psychic ability. Only by spilling blood, he learned, could he gain any respite and the Inquisitor eventually embraced Khorne and later became the Arch Deacon of the Blooded Hand Chaos Cult. However, only a Space Marine's body is capable of withstanding the negative effects of the Butcher's Nails and it is doubtless that Krage will survive for much longer, bearing a dark miracle. In fact, it was in search of such a miracle that recently caused Krage to lead his Cult in successfully summoning the Bloodthirster Skarbrand from the Warp. He knows that by aiding the Greater Daemon in spreading its infectious rage, a new age of unending violence will begin, that will save his life by finally ending the constant torment the Butcher's Nails is causing him. Krage is now fighting beside Skarbrand, with the Blooded Hand, as the Daemon rampages across a Sector of space intent on drowning it in blood. However, an Imperium strike force, led by the Grey Knights Captain Astura, has recently arrived to stop Skarbrand from permanently dragging the embattled Sector into Khorne's hands.
Revivificators	The Revivificators are a branch and subfaction within the Inquisition of the Imperium and descend partly from the Thorians' beliefs. Unlike other Resurrectionist cults, the Revivificators have few ties with the Ministorum. Their goal is the study of the transition of the soul to the Warp at the moment of death. Though their studies of the soul are similar to the Casophilians and the Anomolian Beholders, the Revivificators seek a means through which death can be slowed or even halted and ultimately returned. This peculiar field means that Inquisitors that follow this philosophy tend to be found on the battlefield or in plague areas where they conduct investigations on those that are nearing death. In addition to such locales, they are also common visitors to tombs and mausoleums which leads to a certain amount of disrespect to the practices of the Ecclesiarchy. This has also led to a reputation in them being called "ghouls" and "ravens" due to the morbid nature of their practices. Revivificators are known to have learned much from the capture of various Eldar over the centuries. This is because they find the aspect of the Eldar spirit to be a fascinating field of study and have conducted numerous experiments in replicating the practice of capturing a departing soul. However, all these attempts have been unsuccessful as Mankind's psychic technology is far inferior to the psychic engineering properties of the Eldar Wraithbone. In addition to this, there are also those who follow this belief who have read Inquisitor Lord Van Hinkel's Treatise on the Soultheft Methods of Eldar Pirates which was written in the 39th Millennium. The detailed text contains a report of the Inquisitor's findings of the interrogation of a captured Dark Eldar which also contained collated information from many other sources which were previously scattered in various libraries and datafiles that were present throughout the Inquisition's fortresses and stations. Among the least scrupulous of the Revivificators, there have been attempts at repeating the torturous practices of the Dark Eldar on heretics and other criminals, though they are not exclusive to such a treatment. There are few within the Inquisition who are aware of the grisly dungeons that are staffed by telepaths and which are wired to arcane machinery for the detection as well as the extraction of psychic energy.
Argent (Short Story)	"Vaults of Terra: Argent" is a short story by Chris Wraight. It was published online in March 2017. Interrogator Luce Spinoza's hunt for a traitor brings her to Forfoda and into the company of the Imperial Fists. Unearthing a den of corruption, Spinoza learns what it means to fight alongside the Emperor's Angels, and vows to prove herself worthy of this honour or die in the attempt.
Eye of Night	The Eye of Night was an ancient artefact connected to the Hand of Darkness located in the Gothic Sector world of Ornsworld. In appearance it is a multifaceted obsidian crystal of unknown origin and can emit an ebon beam, that causes machines to suffer massive power failure or catastrophic internal damage. The Eye of Night once was once located inside of the eye of a statue, on the Ratling Imperium world Ornsworld, where it was worshipped by them as a god in pre-Imperial times. However, Ornsworld was later invaded by Chaos Space Marines attempting to secure the eye and they proceeded to blockade and siege its inhabitants until they retrieved it. The Chaos Space Marines' initial attack was pushed back by an Imperial Guard recruiting force, but a month later the Chaos blockade was erected and a full invasion began. The Ratlings could not stand against such a force and the death toll was in the millions as they fled into the hills. Lieutenant Comton-Hawkins of the recruitment force, recorded some of the atrocities caused by the Chaos forces, such as wiping out the small settlement of Esmerelda's Dale and bringing the side of the Great Belly mountain down, sweeping away seven towns and 82,000 ratlings. Inquisitor Thadus Valconet Horst attempted to recover the artefact, but it was seized by the forces of Chaos, Abaddon the Despoiler having learned of its location from the seer Moriana.[3b] Abaddon used the Eye of Night and the Hand of Darkness during the Gothic War to take control of the Blackstone Fortresses and attacked the Cardinal World Savaven with the Planet Killer to destroy the secret Inquisitorial Fortress beneath which Horst had kept his records of the artefacts.[3a]
Safehaven	Safehaven was the site of the battle where Inquisitor Sophia Vilimas and the Masque of the Midnight Sorrow defeated the forces of the Alpha Legion, and in so doing prevented a massive Daemonic incursion.
Maginor	Maginor is the capital world of the Niaides Sub-Sector. It has earned a reputation of notoriety as the homeworld of the Mystic Path, a group of traders and noblemen who used Warp artefacts to do their business. After his initial contact with the Mystic Path, the renegade Inquisitor Quixos made Maginor the heart of his operations and established a mountain fastness there, as the influence of the Path eventually spread throughout the Segmentum. The cell of five Inquisitors that killed Quixos, led by Gregor Eisenhorn, initially planned on travelling to Maginor to confront the corrupted Inquisitor. On the advice of Gideon Ravenor, Eisenhorn's pupil and later brother Inquisitor, the cell shifted their operations to Farness Beta, leaving Maginor to the Ordos Niaides (the Inquisition's sect in the Niaides sub-sector).
Ordo Aegis	The Ordo Aegis is a minor Ordo of the Inquisition. Founded sometime in M40, they oversee the Cadian Gate.
Divine Will (Short Story)	Divine Will is a short story by Andy Smillie. It was published online on December 2015. A Vindicare Assassin thwarts an attempt on the life of an inquisitor as a way to spread faith in the Emperor. When the last survivor of a Chaos cult seeks to assassinate an Inquisitor at a huge public gathering, a Vindicare Assassin is the only one who might be able to stop it. There is more than just a life on the line, however, as the battle of ideologies unfolds.
Armageddon Prime	This article needs work on its citations.For help on citation see the citation guidelines. You can help Lexicanum by fixing it. The world is made up of three main continents and two large named oceans as well as one region of island chains. They each had their roles in the Armageddon Wars but the majority of the fighting took place on the main continent.[2d] The Fire Wastes are located in the far north of Armageddon.[2d] Regardless of its position, it is the location of many of the ore mines that supply the main Armageddon region with resources in order to create the weapons it needs to survive.[Needs Citation]
Tallemachus Leyk	Tallemachus Leyk is an Ordo Malleus Inquisitor, who traveled to Armageddon after the Great Rift's creation to watch over the world's Red Angel's Gate. The Gate was a empyric fault line, that had been created by the Daemon Primarch Angron when he invaded the world, during the First War for Armageddon. Leyk's Space Marine Captain ally believed the Gate would soon open, due to the Great Rift, which led the Inquisitor to watch over it. The Captain was later proven correct, when the Gate burst open and hordes of Khorne's Daemons began to rampage across Armageddon. This was during the Ork Warlord Thraka's second invasion of the world and in response to the Daemons' sudden invasion, Leyk immediately had Armageddon blockaded. He also began cleansing any Imperial forces that had been affected by the presence of Khorne's hordes, but faced resistance while doing so. The Imperial commanders defending Armageddon still believed that the Orks were the true threat and objected to the Inquisitor having their forces purged or mind wiped. To Leyk however, the commanders objections were foolish, as with the appearance of Daemons, the war against the Orks no longer mattered. Worse still, Leyk feared the Daemon Primarch Angron would soon appeared and sent a desperate message for aid to his Space Marine ally. The Inquisitor asked the Captain to come to Armageddon with whatever strength he could, as Leyk felt only the Captain could prevent Angron's emergence. Leyk worried, though, that by the time his message was received, it could be too late to save Armageddon.
Faustus Mael	Faustus Mael is a fire wielding Ordo Hereticus Puritan Inquisitor, who burns anything he considers to be even slightly heretical. He normally fights besides the Black Templars Chapter, who are also well known for abhorring witches and Heretics. Inquisitor Faustus Mael... ...and his Retinue
Ramius Stele	Ramius Stele was an Inquisitor Lord of the Ordo Hereticus. Once a loyal servant of the Emperor, Stele turned from his light to seek out forbidden knowledge to deepen his understanding of the Warp. He soon fell under the sway of Chaos, and through his experiments he caused the destruction of the Hive world Orilan. Later, Stele made a pact with the Daemon Lord Malfallax in a plan to subvert the Blood Angels to Chaos Undivided to join the 13th Black Crusade. Using Arkio as a figurehead, he spun a lie that had all but the most devout of Blood Angels believing that he was Sanguinius reborn. The intervention of Rafen however, disrupted the scheme; and Stele died when Malfallax manifested through his body and used it as a host for the daemon's monstrous form.[Needs Citation] This article needs work on its citations.For help on citation see the citation guidelines.

Verus Tormun	Verus Tormun is an Ordo Hereticus Inquisitor who fought the xenos Necrons as well as a human rebellion on the world of Hadrea.
Talledus System	The Talledus System is a System of Segmentum Solar's Veritus Sub-Sector.[1a][1b] Located in the heart of the Veritus Sub-Sector, the System is a stronghold of the Ecclesiarchy. Its capital world of Benediction was entirely covered by a golden theocropolis, reshaped into a mausoleum-temple to house the corpses of thousands of Saints. This project began under Ecclesiarch Sebastian Thor in the aftermath of the Age of Apostasy, during which the Talledus System suffered greatly after Talledus' Governor Hectus Carmine spoke out against Goge Vandire. This set off a vicious battle between the System's Imperial Guard defenders and Vandire's Frateris Templar during which Carmine was burnt at the stake and much of the System was purged. In the aftermath of the slaughter Thor ventured to Talledus and declared a grand rebuilding that would see it reshaped into what it is today.[1a] Following the formation of the Great Rift, the Talledus System initially was untouched by the corruption of the Warp.[1a] However all this changed thanks to the machinations of Kor Phaeron, which began the Talledus War.[1c]
Magnus (Inquisitor)	Magnus is an Inquisitor, who informs the Ordos on how best to interrogate the servants of Slaanesh they have captured.
Dreya Magnafeldt	Dreya Magnafeldt is an Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus. She fights alongside the Adeptus Mechanicus of Deimos.
Hetris Lugenbrau	Hetris Lugenbrau was an Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus. Lugenbrau led a small army of about sixty of his retainers to the planet Maginor in 239.M41 in a hunt for the corrupted Inquisitor Quixos. According to official records, he is listed as having disappeared. However, based on a transcript of a pict-recording taken during Lugenbrau's raid against the Mystic Path's mountain fastness on Maginor, it was clear he was killed by Quixos's daemonhost servant, Cherubael. Lugenbrau had been a pupil of Inquisitor Pavel Uet, a comrade of Commodus Voke. During the raid against Quixos' operations of Farness Beta over a century later, Voke related to Gregor Eisenhorn — who led the cell of Inquisitors - that Lugenbrau's disappearance on Maginor had affected Uet greatly, and shortened his life. That fact eventually convinced Voke that Quixos had to pay.
Orphean War	The Orphean War (also known as Orpheus War[2b] or Orpheus Crisis) is a conflict being waged in the Orpheus Sector since 991.M41 between the forces of the Imperium and the Necron Maynarkh Dynasty. Striking suddenly and essentially without warning, the Necron forces of the sector struck not a single Imperial world but scores of planets and outposts, conducting total genocide of the local populace wherever they struck. The Adeptus Mechanicus world of Harrow Watch and the Frontier Worlds of Pallasite, Khatris, and Borrus had their populations erased seemingly instantly. On Libethra, the Fortress-Monastery of the Angels Revenant, contact was also quickly lost. Only at the Inquisitorial Fortress of Apollyon was the alarm first raised, allowing for the sector Battlefleet, Imperial Guard, and local PDF units to be mobilized. However, at this time, the Imperium was still unaware of who exactly they were facing. The Sector Commander, Calibron Laan, took the opportunity to strip away garrisons from other worlds and instead protect his domain of Amarah.[1a] Though the Imperium expected more devastating attacks after the initial round of destruction, months went by without any sightings of the enemy. Lord Inquisitor Hiram Ntshona of the Ordo Malleus was firm in his belief, however, that the enemy was Daemonic in nature, not heretical or xenos. After many months of waiting, the enemy again made itself known in the form of a massive pulsing signal that overtook the sector, initially overloading the minds of Astropaths. In the signal were the sounds of agonizing screams, whispers in an unknown tongue, and most disturbing of all the phrase Maynarkh comes in Imperial Gothic. Even worse, it became known that Libethra, the Angels Revenant homeworld, had been reduced to a pile of ash. Soon, terror and panic gripped the entire sector in the face of this frightful message and the true scale of the mysterious foes initial strikes became known.[1a]
Strike Force Calern	Strike Force Calern was a Grey Knights Strike Force under the leadership of Brother-Captain and Inquisitor Varus of the Ordo Hereticus. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Traxis Sector	The Traxis Sector lies deep within the Ultima Segmentum and has just recently been explored by the Imperium. What the Imperium discovered was a sector rich in worlds with both natural resources and artifacts lost since the Dark Age of Technology. In order to secure these treasures however, the forces of the Imperium now wage a bloody conflict throughout the sector, desperately holding back tides of Daemons and Xenos alike. The foul forces of Chaos meanwhile seek to plunder and corrupt the Traxis Sector, furthering their own goals of conquest and madness. Alien races of all kinds also endeavor to build their own empires, casting out all that would challenge their dominance. Imperium Chaos - Great Unclean One Ku'Gath Plaguefather[1c], High Sorcerer Zarathur[1a]
Arrod Moadh	Arrod Ibn Moadh is an Ordo Malleus Inquisitor who was sent to investigate a prophetic warning of a devastating Chaos invasion given by the Grey Knights' Prognosticators during the 13th Black Crusade. The warning came too late, however, because when Moadh finally discovered that the warning was for the Mining World Extremis Six, it had already been devastated in an invasion by the Emperor's Children and the Riotous Host Traitor Titan Legion.
Jeriminus	Jeriminus, also known as Jeriminus of Paelutia, was a Puritan Inquisitor. Many centuries after the Inquisitor Goldo declared that everything but the Imperium would have to be destroyed for Mankind to survive, he revitalized Goldo's teachings and founded the Monodominant philosophy.
Valossian Sythrac	Valossian Sythrac is the highest ranking Archon of the Black Heart Kabal and is considered to be the most loyal and reliable of the Dark Eldar under Supreme Overlord Asdrubael Vect's command. Valossian Sythrac of the Black Heart is a rare individual indeed – one of the few Archons to have consistently retained Supreme Overlord Vect’s favour. Vect long ago grew bored of Archons bearing news of the conquest of planets and star systems, for such mundane victories rarely last long in the grand scheme of things. Instead the Supreme Overlord rewards those with the wit to damage or topple entire galactic empires. Sythrac is such an individual – his ongoing quest to assassinate each of the Imperium’s most vaunted heroes is a hot topic within Vect’s courts. The practical applications of weakening the Imperium’s command structure aside, Sythrac’s tactic is to extinguish hope itself – to rob the upstart humans of those that they hold dear, and deprive them of the will to fight against the encroaching darkness. Every Dark Eldar finds a perverse delight in reminding the lesser races of their place; Valossian Sythrac makes it his life’s work. Because of his status, Sythrac commands the Kabal's forces in Vect's name, but his critics consider him to be nothing but a puppet ruler. Despite this though, none can deny that Sythrac is an effective leader or that he is a remorseless hunter once sent loose against the Overlord's enemies. While not being given direct orders from Vect, Sythrac pursues legendary figures amongst other Xenos races and kills them with his Husk Blade, in order to capture their souls within traps built into his armour. This has earned him the name Soul Hunter[1a] and so far a thousand[1b] heroes, leaders, philanthropists, healers, and warriors have fallen to Sythrac's blade. These souls are not mere trophies however, as the Archon's armour is also equipped with complex bio-harmonics that use their stolen energies to invigorate Sythrac's ancient body[1a] and they can also be drawn upon to greatly increase his strength and speed in combat. All the while, his victims' souls are aware of their fate and are constantly whispering in the back of his mind; offering pleas, threats, advise, and curses upon the Archon's name.[1b]
Judgement (Short Story)	Judgement is a short story by Mark Latham. It was published online on September 5, 2013. In the wake of the defection of many of his battle-brothers, Chapter Master Konstantos of the Doom Legion plays host to an inquisitor sent to check upon the purity of the remaining warriors. But Konstantos is hiding a secret in the depths of his star fortress, a secret that could consign the entire Chapter to oblivion if it is discovered.
Logans World	Logan's World is an Imperium world located in the Eye of Terror.[2b] Upon its waterless and barren surface live human and Orks sometimes fighting with each other for scarce resources sometimes cooperating for survival in the planet's hostile environment.[2b] It is known that renegade Myron Jubalgunn visited this planet in concert with a dangerous xenos of unknown origin. Citizens of Logan's World were warned about this threat by Inquisitor Toulon Hess, though it is unknown what consequences this had.[2a]
Warhammer Siege	Published in 1988, Warhammer Siege is an expansion book for the games of Warhammer Fantasy Battle: 3rd Edition and Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader. The book has 140 pages with the cover printed in color. The majority of the books contents are printed in black and white with some images of miniatures and a few illustrations in colour. The book was released in conjunction with The Mighty Fortress, a polystyrene castle that is now out of production, and introduced rules for fighting sieges in both the fantasy and rogue trader worlds, and even gave rules and suggestions for mixing the two.
Leonid Rostov	Leonid Rostov is a Psyker Ordo Xenos Inquisitor, who took part in the Indomitus Crusade.[2a] As a youth, Rostov was an Unsanctioned Psyker who was taken at the age of 10 by the League of Blackships. The last memory Rostov had of his old life, was tearfully crying out for his mother, as he was captured. Rostov vowed not to show such emotional weakness ever again and kept a stern and perpetually calm attitude[2a]. He developed a powerful array of abilities under the Imperium's training. This included being able to shroud his presence, instantly learn the value of a person's soul, and read the memories of those under torture. Though this came at the cost of feeling any pain inflicted upon the tortured person and having his memories open to them as well. Using this last ability left Rostov feeling tainted, though, and increased his hatred of being a psyker. It was only through prayer that he was able to cleanse himself, which Rostov undertook before and after using that ability. He would go on to serve as an Interrogator for the Inquisitor Lord Jeren Dyre for 20 years afterwards. During that time, Rostov not only became Dyre's protege, but the Inquisitor Lord also considered him a son. At around his 30 years old[2a], Rostov was so well experienced that Dyre had offered to make him an Inquisitor, but the Interrogator refused. Rostov claimed he still needed several more years to serve beside Dyre and aided the Inquisitor Lord in investigating a Blackstone trading network. The Adeptus Mechanicus were the main buyers of the Blackstone and Dyre secretly began observing them to ensure they respected the Lex Imperialis. This led to Dyre and his retinue executing several rogue Magi, but soon a number of Chaos Cults began claiming a greater portion of the Blackstone. The Inquisitor Lord would destroy the Cults with the aid of the Ordo Hereticus, though they rarely were able to recover the Blackstone itself. After this continued to happen, Dyre theorized that someone was organizing the Cults from behind the scenes. He soon pieced together that the Cult's Blackstone was being used to create a giant device that would be able to increase the size of the Great Rift. In order to confirm this, Dyre had several of the Blackstone Cultists interrogated by Rostov who confirmed Dyre's theory. A figure known as the Hand had been constructing a Blackstone device to expand the Great Rift, but it was now nearly completed. Worse still, it was to be given to the Crusade of Slaughter to use, as they rampaged across the Imperium.[2a]
Gustavus	Gustavus is an Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos. He has had many decades' experience tracking and hounding Orks through the galaxy. After so long, Gustavus has gained a reputation for savagery, barbarism and leathery toughness - ironically much like the xenos he hunts.
Sleevik	Sleevik is an Ordo Sepulturum Inquisitor, who took part in the Indomitus Crusade. The Inquisitor was among those of the Ordo Sepulturum that were called upon to deal with a Warp plague outbreak, among the ships of Indomitus Crusade Fleet Quintus. Sleevik informed Lord Commander Guilliman that it would take a week to purify the fleet, but would come at a high cost. Many lives and material would be lost in the process and the launching of Fleet Quintus would be significantly delayed as well.

Lhor'il	Lhor'il is an Imperial Inquisitor. Her rosette was an electoo, coded with her genetics, inscribed around her right eye.
Scarabus	Hive Fleet Scarabus is a Tyranid Hive Fleet. It fought against Gantor Rough Riders on the planet of Coronis. The fleet was devastated at the walls of Fortress Carcasson in 937.M41 by the Cadian 9th, who didn't lose even a single company in the conflict.
Markhov	Markhov was an Ordo Hereticus Inquisitor who accompanied the Ultramarines 4th Company to the planet Epsilon Regalis of the Formosa Sector, during a mission to capture a rogue psyker. Markhov requested the assistance of the Ultramarines in investigating the planet Epsilon Regalis, which had recently turned away from the light of the Emperor for unknown reasons (later discovered to be the influence of a rogue psyker). Chapter Master Marneus Calgar consented and allowed the 4th Company, led by Captain Idaeus, to be seconded to his service. However, Markhov refused to disclose the nature of the heretic that they were after, stating bluntly that he had the tools to deal with it, which would later turn out to be his downfall as the Ultramarines were ill-prepared to face the threat that the psyker would pose. Captain Idaeus, a contingent of Assault Marines, and the-then Veteran Sergeant Uriel Ventris were to attack the centre of the rebellion with the assistance of Markhov. While this was occurring, Veteran Sergeants Pasanius and Learchus were also headed to the battle within Rhino transports escorted by Predator Annihilators.
Globus Vaarak	The most dangerous weapon this galaxy has ever produced is faith. All other force is merely a shadow of what that terrible power can achieve.— Inquisitor Globus Vaarak, Ordo Hereticus[1b] Globus Vaarak is a Inquisitor of the Ordo Hereticus active in the Calixis Sector.[1a] Severely wounded as a interrogator while battling pirates, Vaarak lost both his legs and an arm and is now permanently attached to a mechanical life support system. He is a strict Amalathian and known for his conservative views, seeking out sedition and rebellion across the Sector.[1a] Due to his appearance and limitations, he conducts most of his work through his Acolytes and is surprisingly subtle in his work.[1a] Vaarak has since become a member of the Tyrantine Cabal of Inquisitors, where he has become known for his bleak sense of humour and surprising judge of character.[1a]
Ciaphas Cain	Some of my fellow inquisitors may be shocked to discover that one of the Imperium's most venerated heroes was, by his own admission, a scoundrel and a self-seeking rogue; a fact of which, due to our sporadic personal association, I have long been aware. Indeed, I would go so far as to contend that it was this very combination of character flaws which made him one of the most effective servants the Imperium has ever had, despite his strenuous efforts to the contrary. For, in his century or more of active service to the Commissariat, and occasional less visible activities at my behest, he faced and bested almost every enemy of humanity: necrons, tau, tyranids and orks, eldar, both free of taint and corrupted by the ruinous powers, and the daemonic agents of those powers themselves. Reluctantly, it must be admitted, but in many cases repeatedly, and always with success; a record few, if any, more noble men can equal." Ciaphas Cain ((Kai-a-fass Kane))[11c] was an Imperial Commissar. He was in active service in the last century of M41, and was over 200 years old when he was recalled into service during the 13th Black Crusade of Abaddon the Despoiler, and it is certain that he survived more than a quarter of a century into M42. Propaganda made him out to be the hero of the Imperium circa late M41 although in truth he was mainly focused on surviving. (However he differed from many other Imperial Commissars in that he would not readily sacrifice soldiers unless it ensured his own survival.) Cain tried his utmost to avoid engaging in actual combat, but would have to anyway to maintain his status as a Hero of the Imperium, which ironically, would involve him in more dangerous situations than any he would usually see as a Commissar. He was responsible for many successful campaigns throughout his career and retired to become a professor at a Schola Progenium.[1a] In M42 the Cain Archive was published among the ranks of the Inquisition. They are sequestered by order of the Holy Ordos, and are kept and organized as the Cain Archive by Ordo Xenos Inquisitor Amberley Vail with whom Cain had many encounters over his career, and shared a close working and personal relationship. It is worth noting, as Inquisitor Vail does in footnotes throughout his memoirs, that Cain was a skilled liar and dissembler, and therefore anything to which he refers that is not independently documented could well be a fabrication to maintain his reputation.[1a]
Bastian Verveuk	Bastian Verveuk was a young, idealistic Ordo Xenos Inquisitor, who was also a Puritan to a fault and was formerly Inquisitor Leonid Osma's Interrogator. He had only been an Inquisitor for seven months, when he was sent to the Imperial world Durer, to take part in Inquisitor Eisenhorn's hunt for the Heretic Fayde Thuring. While there, Verveuk was overawed by his proximity to the older Inquisitor and continually tried to impress Eisenhorn with rather sycophantic behaviour. When Eisenhorn's agents finally discovered Thuring's location, Verveuk joined them to confront the Heretic, though not altogether with the older Inquisitor's approval. However by the time they found Thuring, the Heretic had gained control of the hidden Chaos Titan Cruor Vult and proceeded to kill several of Eisenhorn's agents and allies. In desperation, Eisenhorn summoned forth his powerful Daemonhost Cherubael, which managed to destroy the Cruor Vult, but the Daemon's host body was destroyed in its battle with the Chaos Titan. This freed Cherubael and in order to regain control of the Daemon, Eisenhorn was forced to use Verveuk's body as a vessel to contain it. Though Cherubael was successfully bound within Verveuk's body, the process killed the young Inquisitor.
Thastrobel	Thastrobel is an enigmatic Inquisitor who was the first recorded owner of the Blackshroud, which has since become a relic of the Inquisition.
Gotterich Valon	Gotterich Valon, is a Thorian Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus, who was once the Cardinal of the Imperial world, San Sebastian. It was during his service as a Cardinal, that Valon worked with the Missionarus Galaxia to create several Schola Progeniums and in 965.M41, he began a five-year tour of these Scholas, in recognition for his sterling service to the Ecclesiarchy. His visit to the Schola Progenium abby on Luchesio nearly caused his end though, as it was being invaded by Orks at the time and the abby was destroyed, during a bomb raid by the Xenos. After the bombing, Valon was trapped in the rubble of the Schola abby, until he was rescued by the 12 year old girl Louisa Della Monica, who had miraculously been unhurt by the Orks' attack. This led Monica to be declared blessed by the Emperor and she became one of Valon's charges, along with several others, who became veterans of Luchesio's invasion. Valon then once again, began touring the Scholas he created and it was during the tour's final year, that he encountered Inquisitor Van Dremen on Sanagua Primar. The two would soon become friends and shortly afterwards, Valon relinquished his Ecclesiarchal duties in order to aid the Inquisitor in his investigations. Under Dremen's tutelage, Valon would eventually become the Inquisitor's Interrogator and in time, he became an Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus. Since joining the Ordo, he has fought in many conflicts, the most notable being the defense of Cadia, during the 13th Black Crusade. Valon was heavily wounded while defending the invaded Fortress World however and as a result, his body now needs to be artificially sustained by chem-inducers and bionics.
Tiber Achilus	Tiber Achilus was an Imperial Warmaster and before that a Lord Militant of the Imperial Guard. Born in the Ixaniad Sector on the Hive World of Lordrium, Achilus was a product of a long and noble line of Generals that had served for centuries. His birth came at a time that Lordrium's citizens believed to be associated with great prophecy and portent. Mysterious graceful men in strange robes appeared and strange ships were seen in orbit. As he grew to adulthood, Tiber Achilus became known as a masterful swordsman and canny tactician, excelling in Lordrium's officer corps as a cadet. While his siblings succumb to vices and decadance, he remained focused on his task to be a soldier. His first taste of combat came when he was 20 years old, serving in the 38th Hive Krolo PDF. He made a name for himself quickly in the battle, holding against Redgarvi hordes. In the next 40 years of service in the Imperial Guard's Purebloods he earned Sector-wide reputation while made contacts with the Imperial Navy and noble houses of the region. While campaigning against the Khrave in the Formorian Sector he was nearly slain by Eldar that vanished as soon as they had arrived. Achilus only survived the experience as the Eldar Pathfinders seemed to deliberately spare his life. Achilus was later chosen to lead the Achilus Crusade into the Jericho Reach, with the High Lords of Terra only taking a few months to name him Lord Militant of the Crusade. However, fairly early into the Crusade he was lost aboard his Grand Cruiser after a Gellar Field malfunction occurred during Warp transit. His death was mysterious and has raised much suspicion within the Inquisition. The Ordo Malleus eventually investigated, believing his death to be Chaos related, but eventually seemed to connect his fate to that of the Eldar assassin Syndilian Shanyr. He was succeeded as commander of the Crusade by Lord General Militant Solomon Tetrarchus.
Armageddon	Armageddon is a Hive World of the Imperium. It is the fourth planet of the Armageddon System.[6h] To the Orks the world is known as Armour-Geddem. Armageddon has been the site of some of the largest wars in the Imperium's history. "Armageddon, a world whose name is known across the Imperium. Armageddon, a world whose name has become a byword for war and destruction on a massive scale. Armageddon, where the fate of a thousand worlds hangs in the balance."
Ordo Astartes	The Ordo Astartes is a minor Ordo of the Inquisition. Founded in M32, they oversee the Chapters of the Adeptus Astartes. The strength of the Ordo is currently estimated at 50 Inquisitors. During the Second Founding, they forcibly disbanded the Wolf Brothers, owing to that Chapter's aberrant gene-seed. The Wolf Brothers were given a choice between honourable death in battle or Inquisitorial execution; however, many of their number escaped entirely, with some members of the Adeptus Terra accusing the Primarch Leman Russ of aiding their flight.
Bloodquest (Graphic Novel Series)	Comprised of three graphic novels and an audio drama, the Bloodquest series follows the exploits of the exiled Blood Angels Captain, Leonatos, as he journeys through the Eye of Terror on a mission to reclaim a Chapter relic, the Blade Encarmine. Written by Gordon Rennie and illustrated by Colin MacNeil, the graphic novel series was published in Warhammer Monthly between 1999 and 2003. The series was later continued in 2013 in the form of an audio drama, written by Ben Counter. Bloodquest Bloodquest II: Into the Eye of Terror
Qualtak Shoran	Qualtak Shoran is an Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus.
Order of the Wyrm	The Order of the Wyrm is a Genestealer Cult, that infests the Fedual Agri World Gorgomire. However they masquerade as an elite Knightly order and had won great renown defending its population, who treated them as heroes. The Order also acted as bodyguards for Gorgomire's Governor-King, Archimayn XII and hid their corruption beneath suits of armour. Archimayn's court magister, Bargo Xathus, was also a member of the Order, but had secretly joined a Chaos Cult that was active on Gorgomire. It is not known if he was the only member, but sometime after the Great Rift's creation, the two Cults began attacking each other. This was just as Gorgomire was visited by the Ordo Xenos Inquisitor Loramon Valir and the Ordo Malleus Inquisitor Sythra Min, who had each come separately to destroy the Cults. When the Inquisitors became aware of each other, they agreed to work together to purge both the Genestealer and Chaos taint from Gorgomire.
Second Abonian Genocide	The Second Abonian Genocide began in 688.M40 when Inquisitor Halan Jentz of the Ordo Hereticus declared the entire population of the Abonian Sub-Sector diabolos inculcatus. The Inquisitor then gathered together a Crusade army that included elements of the War Bearers, Red Hunters and Subjugators Chapters, as well as the Orders of the Blue Robe and Black Sepulchre of the Adepta Sororitas, to bring the population of the Sub-Sector to account for their crimes. The Crusade raged within the Sub-Sector for a decade, before the Inquisitor declares their task is finally complete.
Caspiel Rex	Caspiel Rex is an Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus[1a], who took part in the defense of the Imperium world of Meridian, when it came under attack by the Ork Space Hulk Rok of Ages. Later during The Blood Purge of Crixos, he commanded a battlegroup, along with Captain Thoul of the Minotaurs Chapter, that came to the aid of the Hive World Crixos during a devastating Black Legion invasion[1b]. In the battle that followed, to save the last remaining Hive on the planet, Rex led his retinue in a charge against a group of Bloodletters. Though it appeared that the Inquisitor's group would prevail, they were easily cut down by the Daemons. Rex was thought to have been killed, but later emerged alive, but injured, after the battle, which saw the battlegroup successfully defeat the Black Legion's forces.[1c] He also defended the Venta Secundus from some enemy.
Raiven	Raiven is a famous Ordo Malleus Inquisitor Lord.
Tech-heresy	Tech-Heresy, also known as Heretechnica, are forbidden sciences and technologies as dictated by the strictures of the Cult Mechanicus and Adeptus Mechanicus. In M30 the Treaty of Olympus between the Martian Parliament and the Emperor imposed several restrictions upon the Mechanicum’s practices, labelling much of the knowledge possessed by the Forge Worlds as ‘heretechnica’ – a heresy against the Emperor in his authority as an avatar of the Omnissiah. There were many such forbidden heretechnical sciences and technologies. The Dark Mechanicum was a coalition of Magi which saw these restrictions as shackles placed upon the ambition, imagination, curiosity and righteousness of purpose of the entire Mechanicum. They rejected the notion of the Emperor embodying the Machine God’s purpose, and cast off the fetters placed upon them, continuing their research into forbidden lore. Dark deeds and unspeakable experiments simmered and festered within the Mechanicum, carefully hidden from the Imperium’s eyes until the conclusion of the Great Crusade, during which time the Warmaster Horus sent his emissaries to many Magi who felt themselves oppressed by the Emperor’s dictates. The Warmaster offered an open hand of friendship and promised to sweep aside the Emperor’s restrictions.
Mokartus	Mokartus was an infamous Xanthite Inquisitor of the Ordo Hereticus, who was captured and put on trial by her peers for Radicalism; she was subsequently found guilty and Excommunicated.[1a] Mokartus' Acolytes would later free her after the trial and she would escape the Inquisition's grasp.[1b]
Siege of Vraks	The Siege of Vraks was a major campaign waged by the Imperium to reclaim the world of Vraks, first from traitorous forces, and later from Chaos. Trouble on Vraks began when the rogue Cardinal Xaphan established a powerful following on the Departmento Munitorum armoury world of Vraks, proclaiming that he was acting against doubters and heretics that threatened the Emperor's divine rule. Xaphan attempted to organize a War of Faith as he established a stranglehold on Vraks, purging any who spoke out against his zealotry. However, his sermons focused on the downtrodden workers and lower circles of Imperial society, and soon Xaphan became a man of the people. This drew the ire of the Ordo Hereticus, which became concerned that the Cardinal was amassing too much personal power and that his preachings of hope to the lower classes may result in open class warfare on Vraks. Thus the Ordo decided to dispatch the Cardinal, deploying a lone Vindicare Assassin for the job. However the assassination attempt failed, and when the attempted murder of their "saviour" at the hands of the Imperial government became known, the citizens of Vraks rose up in open revolt.[1a] The Cardinal's Frateris Militia and labour-soldiers quickly overwhelmed the small Arbites and Adepta Sororitas presence on the planet, dismantling its Administratum buildings on the worlds central Citadel and murdering the Master-Prefect. It took time for news of the uprising to move through Departmento Munitorum, Segmentum, and General Staff levels of command, but eventually a strikeforce was approved to retake the planet and purge the apostate Cardinal Xaphan. The force was dubbed the 88th Imperial Guard Siege Army and consisted of 31 Regiments from the Death Korps of Krieg. Overall command of the operation was given to Lord Commander Zuehlke. The Departmento Munitorum planners knew that Xaphan's rebel forces were well-armed from the planets stores and dug into the formidable defences of Vraks, so picking the Krieg Regiments, themselves siege and trench warfare specialists, seemed like the natural choice.[1a]
Korscht	Korscht was a highly decorated Lord Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos, active in early M38. In 182.M38, Korscht gathered a company of Deathwatch Space Marines and moved to defend the Industrial World of Demoisne from Dark Eldar attack. Ambushed by the Deathwatch and the planet's orbital defenses, the raiders were forced to withdraw after only minutes. However, Korscht went missing after the battle, and later investigations in his Inquisitorial Fortress saw his remains smeared across every page of every occult tomb in his library.
Idris (Inquisitor)	Idris is an Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus, who once served as an Interrogator for Inquisitor Argento. She served alongside her fellow Interrogator Covenant, until they discovered that Argento was attempting to create a Living Saint. The Radical Inquisitor sought to use the Saint to hold the Emperor's spirit, but Idris and Covenant killed Argento and brought an end to his plans. Afterwards, the two were made full Inquisitors by the Ordo Malleus. It is later revealed that Idris in fact one of the members of the Radical Horusian sect known as The Triumvirate dubbed The Sorceress.
Lord of Change	Lords of Change, more fully known as the Watching Lords of Change and also as the Eyes of Tzeentch and the Feathered Lords, are the Greater Daemons of Tzeentch. The most powerful servants of their master, Lords of Change are in many ways essentially minor embodiments of all the characteristics of Tzeentch, renowned for their long-running and intricate schemes that weave across time and fate. Lords of Change are notable for being allowed access to Tzeentch's very own reserves of wisdom and for essentially being expressions of his cunning, which gives them great power. As individuals, they are all said to possess the attitude of wicked children; playful but mischievous and even openly malicious towards the lesser beings they delight in manipulating. Nothing is more pleasing to a Lord of Change than to break open fate and re-shape it, be it by manipulation of individuals or direct action. Even without access to Tzeentch's knowledge of fate, they are said to be deeply intelligent and understanding of life's mysteries. They are powerful sorcerers and resourceful manipulators who appear to mortals as omniscient beings. Their magical abilities are so strong that the most powerful sorcerous incantations of mortals are reckoned to be but simple tricks to a Lord of Change. They are said to be able to turn scores of men into boneless spawn at a mere glance, destroy an armoured vehicle with a flick of a finger, or wrench the soul out of even the mightiest warriors with a simple word. For nothing is made that cannot be unmade, or changed, and such areas are the domains of the daemons of Tzeentch. Furthermore they are capable of seeing the near future which allows them to predict their foes' and allies' every move. Confrontations with these Greater Daemons almost always occur with their foreknowledge; getting the drop on a creature that is an embodiment of the Master of Destiny is unlikely. Thus a Lord of Change can only be defeated when it is part of one of Tzeentch's grand schemes, when he tricks his own Daemon by sending it false visions of the future.[2a]
D. Meloriac	D. Meloriac is an Ordo Chronos Inquisitor, who states that of all the legends told within the Imperium, the Legion of the Damned are the strangest. However, the Inquisitor notes that there are many corroborated accounts about these otherworldly warriors' existence.
Uriel Ventris	Uriel Ventris is the current Captain of the Ultramarines 4th Company. He is descended from 1st Company Veteran Sergeant Lucian Ventris, who died in Macragge's northern Polar Fortress during the Battle for Macragge.[4b] Born on Calth in 876.M41, Uriel Ventris was raised on an underground farm and worked upon the land since the day he was able to walk. At age six, Ventris was recruited by the Ultramarines and trained at the Agiselus Barracks on Macragge; he graduated in 889.M41 and went on to complete his training at the Fortress of Hera.[Needs Citation] Nine years later, he became a full-fledged Marine in the Scout Company, and was finally inducted into the Fourth Company in 909.M41. During his training, he discovered he had a natural talent for war and swore to become the best warrior Macragge had ever seen.[4x]
De Haan (Inquisitor)	De Haan is an Imperial Saint, who was an Inquisitor that served in the Donorian Sector and rooted out Heresy and corruption on over a thousand worlds. He was finally martyred after over two centuries of service at the Battle of Kostiashak, where Chaos warriors captured and then killed De Haan. They nailed portions of his anatomy to the defiled cathedral of Trebian, but De Haan's Acolytes recovered their master's remains. Many of the Inquisitor's relics are now stored in scented rosewood boxes on the worlds De Haan cleansed. One known relic is a dagger, whose handle has been woven with shards of the Inquisitor's armor. A statue of Saint De Haan once resided in the capital city of Rysgah, until it fell to the world's traitorous PDF. They had embraced Heresy and destroyed the Saint's statue, so that it mirrored how the remains of De Haan's body were originally found.
Tannenberg	Tannenburg is a famed Inquisitor and Witch-Finder of the Ordo Hereticus. He is famous for ordering the Order of Our Martyred Lady to attack the Scriptorum of Saint Garrat, having the Battle Sisters drag hundreds of Adeptus Terra scribes screaming to excruciation chambers and burning down the structure. The Adepts lodged formal complaints with the highest authorities on Terra, but were silenced when Tannenburg produced three hundred jars, each containing the remains of an executed scribe, his previously hidden mutations uncovered for all to see. He is also known for destroying all forty-five members of the Psyker Cult, known as the Coven of the Red Moon.
On Wings of Blood (Anthology)	On Wings of Blood is a 2019 anthology novel. In the war-torn galaxy of the 41st Millennium, battle for the blood-soaked skies is fierce and deadly. Brutal Space Marine gunships and Imperial Navy fighters duel against flying horrors, alien interceptors and Chaos craft of every hellish design, for the supremacy of the air is as vital an objective as any battlefield.
Nikolai Ymerich	Nikolai Ymerich was an Inquisitor Lord who fought the Warband of the Chaos Lord Kavator in a mining camp the Chaos Space Marines had captured on the Imperium world Karis Cephalon. Ymerich had been tracking the Warband for sometime and when he finally located them, the Inquisitor Lord came prepared and brought with him a force from the Cadian Imperial Guard, led by Colonel Montavius. The battle that ensued in the mining camp was brutal, but when it finally ended the Inquisitor Lord and his entire force lay dead, though they had managed to kill Kavator and inflicted heavy casualties to the Chaos Lord's Warband.
Fyodor Karamazov	"There is no such thing as a plea of innocence in my court. A plea of innocence is guilty of wasting my time. Guilty." Fyodor Karamazov, also known as the Pyrophant Judge of Salem Proctor, is an Inquisitor Lord of the Ordo Hereticus. A staunch Amalathian, Karamazov is bitterly opposed to the notion of change, believing that the Emperor's plan for His people must be left to unfold as He planned and without the arrogant intervention of those who believe that they understand His will. He is a harsh judge and brooks no pleas of innocence, once famously boasting that he has sent more witches and heretics to their deaths than Macharius.
Jeremias	Jeremias is a Psyker Inquisitor, who took interest in one of the thousands of distress calls the Imperium received, in the aftermath of the Hive World Targian's destruction. He could not explain why the distress call from a group of Targian survivors on an Ice World drew his eye, except that it felt important and perhaps the Emperor was guiding the Inquisitor's hand. After studying it further, Jeremias was certain the item he had been searching for sometime, was on the Ice World and immediately left to rescue the group of survivors located there.
Jericho Reach	The Jericho Reach is located in Ultima Segmentum at the borders of the Imperium. At its centre lies the Hadex Anomaly, within which several Daemon Worlds exist. The Jericho Reach is connected to the Koronus Expanse in Segmentum Obscurus through the Jericho-Maw Warp Gate.[1a] Currently a bastion of Chaos, several other threats have also set their eyes on the Reach. The Tyranid Hive Fleet Dagon is encroaching into the region from the north-east. In the south, the T'au have colonised several worlds. Since 777.M41 the Imperium has been pursuing the Achilus Crusade, also known as the "Dead Crusade". The troops and fleets involved in the Crusade are from the Segmentum Obscurus and use a warp gate to travel to the area, which would otherwise take years of travel in the Warp to surmount any decent offensive.[1b] The Jericho Reach was once called the Jericho Sector, before years of neglect by the Imperium left the sector to fall into decay and eventually into the hands of Chaos. For thousands of years, Chaos has been left to fester in the once rich Imperial worlds, observed only by silent posts manned by the Deathwatch.[3a]
Polypsykana	The Polypsykana is a faction within the Inquisition, consisting of like-minded Radical Inquisitors in the Calixian Conclave who believe in the ascension of Humanity into a purely psychic race. They believe that they themselves must serve as guardians and guide Mankind down this path of transformation. This way of thinking is not unique to the Calixis Sector or to the Imperium in its long history, as similar thoughts have appeared in the past. The Inquisitors of the Polypsykana believe that the metamorphosis is inevitable so long as attempts are not made in preventing it from happening. This is most likely to happen from other Inquisitors who see psykers as witches and abominations that need to be purged which necessitates the involvement of the Polypsykana Inquisitors. These Inquisitors and their agents seek out as well as protect psykers from firebrands that are intent on the destruction of such individuals. This is more so the case in the Calixis Sector which sees a higher number of Humans born with psychic talents and is attributed to the influence of the Tyrant Star. As such, Polypsykana Inquisitors are ever vigilant for seeking any nascent psykers within a sector population and spend considerable resources in accomplishing this task. Any that are found are quickly moved to safety before they are burned at the stake. This is not the only act conducted by this Radical faction as agents of the Polypsykana are also known to find means in hastening the psychic awakening of Mankind. Such an act is accomplished through eugenic techniques as well as the use of powerful psy-active drugs.
Sarrow Gorn	Sarrow Gorn, the Scourge of Abhoth V, is an Ordo Xenos Inquisitor of the Askellon Sector.
Spacewar	The Citadel Combat Cards Spacewar card set was was released in late 1988 (i.e. it is part of the Combat Cards' first edition) and depicts miniatures from the Warhammer 40,000 armies of this period.

The "standard rules" were printed on the backside of the blister. Blister (front)
Von Liese	Von Liese is an Inquisitor who was part of the task force that fought the Tyranids of Hive Fleet Kraken on the Jungle World of Verdicon.
Van Dremen	Van Dremen is an Inquisitor, who had a chance meeting with Cardinal Gotterich Valon on the Imperial world Sanagua Primar, in late M41. The two would soon become friends and Valon would subsequently relinquish his Ecclesiarchal duties, in order to aid in Dremen's investigations. Under his tutelage, Valon would eventually become Dremen's Interrogator and in time, the formal Cardinal became an Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus.
Iulia Lestia	Iulia Lestia was an Ordo Malleus Inquisitor Lord who served as the Inquisitorial Representative on the High Lords of Terra, until her death ten years before the 13th Black Crusade began.
White Dwarf 250 (UK)	White Dwarf 250 (UK) was published in October 2000. it coincides with the release of the 6th Edition of Warhammer Fantasy.
Rykehuss	Rykehuss is a notorious monodominant Inquisitor of the Ordo Hereticus, most known for stopping the rampage of the traitorous Inquisitor Erya Nephthys by killing her a third and final time. Rykeuss is a Witch Hunter of the Ordo and specializes in the finding and capture of Psykers. His most common method of dealing with Psykers is to set up a Court of Odeals in a city of choice, at which point pious citizens bring accused neighbors and family to be tried. This often results in bloody purges as he seeks out to kill all the "sinners". Innocents are invariably killed in this spectacles, but the Inquisitor considers them acceptable losses. This has led Rykehuss to develop a reputation as a hero and butcher simultaneously. As a member of the Tyrantine Cabal, he routinely opposes Inquisitor Vownus Kaede, an other witch hunter that persists saving Psykers from him and his pogroms. The fact that Rykehuss is totally deprived of any known psychic power, despises them, while Kaede is an Alpha Plus psyker himself, does not help in their tumultuous coexistence.
Van Vuygens	Van Vuygens is an Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos active in the Calixis Sector. Rarely seen at Bastion Serpentis, he represents his Ordo on the Tyrantine Cabal. Quiet and scholarly, he prefers to dissect and study xenos instead of exterminating them. Indifferent to all else except alien affairs, despite seeking knowledge on these creatures he has no trust for them and has not descended into Radicalism. Most notably, Van Vuygens is a disciple of the legendary Kryptmann himself, and was sent by him to the Calixis Sector to watch for Tyranid activities. To this end, he believes that the Tyrant Star is the herald of a Tyranid invasion.
Eusebius Nomandes	Eusebius Nomandes is a Lord Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos. He gives intensive lectures on the history of xenos that have been encountered by the Imperium, based off of interrogations, autopsies and notes he has taken of Xenos in his long career in the Ordo.
Selen Thakra	Selen Thakra is an Ordo Machinum Inquisitor, who took part in the Argovon Campaign as part of the Indomitus Crusade's Task Force XI. As the war against the Necrons raged, Thakra served in the Task Force's senior command staff as a representative of the Inquisition's Ordos.
Helgrund	Helgrund was an Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus. Upon reaching inquisitorial rank, Helgrund launched himself on a three-decade search for a powerful tome known as the Malus Codicium, which was a guidebook for the summoning of Daemons. Determining that the tome should be destroyed lest it falls into the wrong hands, Helgrund eventually arrived on Zandrini Prime, where the Malus Codicium was held. However, some time before, a mysterious figure had taken the Malus from its vault. Disappointed but determined, Helgrund continued his search - the trail eventually taking him to the planet Maginor. A group of nobles and traders known as the Mystic Path had set up a mountain fortress on Maginor, and openly used Warp artefacts to influence their patrons and increase demand for their goods. Aided by a small retinue of supporters provided by the Cardinal of Maginor, Helgrund begun a pogrom against the Mystic Path that lasted several weeks. As he put the Mystic Path to the flame, he discovered cultists half-possessed by Daemons and utilizing Chaotic weapons. In the centre of the Path's operations, Helgrund was alarmed to discover, was a fellow Inquisitor - the venerable Quixos.
Re'hneton	Re'hneton is an Inquisitor who, sometime after the Great Rift was created, attempted to imitate the daring Kryptman Gambit when the Industrial World Paragon III was invaded by Donorian Fiends and Dark Eldar. Using a tenuous web of alliances, Re'hneton began luring a Tyranid splinter fleet to Paragon III, in order to destroy the Xenos invading it. However, when the Inquisitor failed to deliver on his own pledges of fealty, his alliances collapsed and Re'hneton inadvertently caused a catastrophe of system-wide proportions, as the splinter fleet advanced on its own. He was then forcibly extracted by Aquila Kill-Team Sayax, who dragged him in chains to Fort Obsidus to face trial for his actions.
Leith Pytov	Leith Pytov is an Ordo Xenos Inquisitor who is such a Puritan, that when faced with fighting both Xenos and the forces of Chaos, he will demand those under his command destroy the Xenos first. If the Inquisitor sees anyone that hesitates to follow this order, he will assume they are weak or worse have sympathy towards the Xenos and will immediately order the Deathwatch forces accompanying him, to kill the traitorous heathen.
Velayne Ramaeus	Velayne Ramaeus is an Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos. Little of certainty is known about the woman, though her credentials are of the highest order and as a result, her authority among the Deathwatch is all but limitless. None remember the details of her arrival in the Jericho Reach, though most assume that the Inquisitor rode in on the first waves of the Achilus Crusade, as few can recall her presence before that time. If asked directly about her service with the Deathwatch, the stewards of Watch Fortress Erioch react with puzzlement. Back through the centuries, scattered among the recollections of the older members of the Deathwatch, are memories of a woman bearing her description, though no official record exists as evidence. It is almost as though she had always been there, but went unnoticed until the last several decades. Beyond her Inquisitorial Rosette and her authentication seal, no concrete record exists of her before the discovery of the Jericho Reach Warp Gate leading to the edge of the Calixis Sector. Despite this lack, the Erioch Chamber of Vigilance has reconciled her credentials and required no other confirmation of her devotion. Since her arrival, Inquisitor Ramaeus has proved to be like many of her kind, not one for sloth or inactivity. In but a few short standard years, she had taken command of the Dead Stations and collected about her the four members of the Deathwatch who would become known collectively as the Dead Cabal. With her trusted Battle-Brothers positioned throughout the Jericho Reach and watchful for unusual phenomena and dire warning signs, the Inquisitor set about her own work, though what this is, few can say. On the rare occasions she has made her actions widely known, it was to provide evidence that the things which lurk between the stars of the Jericho Reach are stirring and to demand that the Deathwatch take action against them. Perhaps due to her intense secrecy and unwillingness to disclose what she has learned, these warnings and demands have largely fallen on deaf ears. As a result, Inquisitor Ramaeus spends little time actually aboard the Watch Stations of the Deathwatch and rarely, if ever, enters the confines of Watch Fortress Erioch. Despite her routine absence, she has a reputation for suddenly appearing where she is most needed and vanishing just as abruptly when the situation has passed; a habit that does little to inspire trust among her fellows. She has a habit of finishing the sentences of others and responding to their actions before they happen, almost as though she knows what one is about to say or do before they do it. Some speculate that this shows that the Inquisitor possesses some psychic talent. Other, highly learned scholars and Adepts among the Deathwatch, whisper even more mysterious explanations, perhaps even a connection to the obscure Ordo Chronos.
Salvodar	Salvodar is an Imperial Inquisitor. His rosette was made out of a mnemocrystal that could grow from his palm at his will.
Ferax Lomar	Ferax Lomar is a Puritan Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos, known for his strict adherence to the rules for Inquisitorial investigations and has devoted his life to ending the lives of Xenos. As such, his record of extermination has made him revered by his Ordo and he is looked upon by many young novices as an exemplar of how an Inquisitor should act. Many jealous onlookers have claimed, however, that Lomar's Puritan stance has made him inflexible and unable to adapt. Regardless of what his detractors believe, when the Forge World Glomus fell to an Ork Waaagh! he was chosen by his Ordo, along with Inquisitor Malum Pyron, to determine which Imperium world the Orks would target next. However, even as the Imperial strike force they accompanied landed upon Glomus, to liberate the Forge World, Lomar and Pyron's differing stances caused a conflict between them. The Puritan Lomar refused to work with the suspected Radical Pyron, who felt the same, and with the promise of promotion, for the one who discovered what world the Orks would target next, the Inquisitors also refused to accept one another's help. Even now as the Imperial strike force struggles to both liberate the world and prevent the Waaagh! from departing, so the Inquisitors can achieve their goal, Lomar and Pyron are now both behind the Orks' battle lines with their retinues; each working separately to determine, where the Waaagh! will strike next.
Plague Hulk	The Plague Hulk is a Daemon Engine of Nurgle. It closely resembles the Soul Grinder, but with a more bloated, decayed appearance - as befitting a machine of the Plague Lord. Plague Hulks appear to be a direct hybrid of machine and Nurgle daemon and is said to be sickly to look upon. The chassis of the machine supports a maggot-ridden mass of daemonic flesh, at the center of which sits a maw capable of vomiting a tide of filth that can rot flesh and corrode metal. Additional weapons include an arm-fused Rot Cannon and an over-sized Plague Sword. Like many other Daemon Engines, these monstrosities also possess massively powerful limbs which can smash through the strongest armor. Worse still, any unfortunate victim that gets too close to a Plague Hulk must endure clouds of flesh-searing poison.

Scouring the Equatorial Jungles of Armageddon for a Chaos monument known as Angron's Monolith, the Inquisitor and the Space Marines were successful in recovering the shard despite coming under attack by Feral Orks.[1c][1d][1e] Halstron is amongst those Inquisitors to make use of a Daemonhost to further his aims.[1b][1c]
Malus Codicium	The Malus Codicium is a dangerous tome of daemonic knowledge. It was highly sought after by several individuals, most notable among whom were Inquisitor Helgrund, who sought to destroy it, and Pontius Glaw, who required its vast sum of knowledge to acquire the Daemon-king Yssarile's barque for himself. It was in the possession of the renegade Inquisitor Quixos until he was killed by Gregor Eisenhorn. Instead of handing the book over to the Inquisition, Eisenhorn hid it for his own use, and through it learned how to bind daemonhosts and create psychic thralls. The book was finally destroyed in a confrontation between Eisenhorn and Pontius Glaw on the planet Ghül.
Gladus	Gladus was an Inquisitor who worked together with Inquisitor Eisenhorn, during the P'glao Conspiracy. Eisenhorn greatly admired Gladus and would seek his help, while being investigated by the Inquisition for the charge of Heresy.

Ardentites	Ardentites is a Puritan philosophy and line of thinking followed by certain members of the Inquisition and are a subfaction of the Thorians. Technically, the Ardentites do not subscribe to the belief in resurrectionism or incarnationism but are often discussed alongside such factions. Their beliefs are not widespread but have persisted in various forms throughout the millennia, either within the broader Thorian beliefs or as a distinctive faction of their own. The basic principles of the Ardentites are centered on the concept of the Emperor Incarnate but that is where the similarities with the Thorians end. Instead of believing in a single Divine Avatar, the Ardentites feel that the power of the God-Emperor is likely to manifest either through a group or, more likely, through the entirety of Mankind itself. Many feel that as Humanity evolves into becoming a psychic race, which is evidenced by the gradual rise in mutation and rise of psychic abilities, that the ultimate aim of the Emperor is to protect Mankind in this vulnerable state by disseminating his power throughout Humanity. Thus, Ardentites do not concern themselves with seeking remarkable individuals but instead attempt to locate evidence of the Emperor's presence in such individuals by proof of talent or psychic ability. This process is considered vague and unsure as none can determine the evidence of the Emperor's presence. Despite this being the case, there is no end to accounts of miraculous events which are accounted to the intervention of the Emperor.
Valis	Valis is a psychic Inquisitor of the Ordo Hereticus. She once led a raid on a rendering plant that was being used as a base by a heretical cult. Her forces included a number of Arbites Exaction Squads and a detachment of Cadians led by Major Kordan. Valis was armed with a hand flamer.
Kill-Team	Kill-Teams are the standard organizational unit of the Deathwatch Space Marines. These Teams are organized to hunt down and kill Xenos and consist of Battle-Brothers from many different Chapters. Kill Teams are often temporary units, with a team being disbanded and its members spread to other teams in order to disseminate knowledge on fighting certain types of Xenos.[4a] The basic organizational structure of a Kill-Team consists of one Sergeant and between four and nine Deathwatch Marines. Deathwatch officers invariably choose their members of their Kill Team in order to draw on as much relevant experience as possible. With different Chapters having long-standing specializations, it is easy to identify those who will have the most relevant insights in a given circumstance. Long-standing rivalries between certain chapters, such as the Dark Angels and Space Wolves, can effect the capabilities of Kill-Teams but more often than not members of these squads will eventually establish bonds of firm friendship.[3b][4a]
Chalnath Expanse	The Chalnath Expanse is a region of space, located in Ultima Segmentum within the Imperium Nihilus. The Expanse became embroiled by conflict in the aftermath of the creation of the Great Rift, most notable of which were Genestealer Cult uprisings and Tau invasions. Not one system avoided conflict. The Tau Commander Shadowsun herself attacked Astorgius while Ctesiphus and Arrajian were the site of Genestealer uprisings. On Haephos, the Imperial defenders engaged in a bitter guerrilla war against the Genestealers and Tau infiltrators. The Riatov System became an inferno of battle between the Tau, Imperial Guard, and Genestealers. Vorotheion seemed immune to the violence for a time before becoming embroiled in a Tau invasion. The Tau wooed disenfranchised Human populations to the Greater Good, establishing insurrectionist cells and proxies to battle the Imperials alongside their conventional forces. The effects of the Psychic Awakening soon made themselves known on the Humans, with Imperial Priests performing "miracles" and even Gue'vesa forces going into bouts of insanity.[2a] The disturbances caused the Order of the Sacred Rose to respond, saving those who remained true to the Emperor while purging all heretics they came across. Warriors of the Tau Fire Caste put up formidable resistance, but the Sisters find the largest threat to be Ethereals whose preachings claim countless Human souls. Recently, Deathwatch Watch Master Agathon has arrived from Watch Fortress Mortguard into the Warzone at the request of the Ordo Xenos Inquisitor Jazad D'ontor.
Horken Paal	Horken 'Irontongue' Paal is an Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos and is among the few Inquisitors that are stranded within the Gilead System, due to the Great Rift's creation. In the course of his career as an Inquisitor, Paal considers his greatest lapse of judgement to have occurred when he attempted to destroy an Ork army. His efforts ended in failure though and Paal now simply destroys any world he discovers is tainted by the Orks' presence.
Wolsan	Wolsan is an Puritanical Inquisitor, who judged the Astra Militarum Colonel Ryn "Biffy" Drecker a heretic, after the extensive damage the Colonel's forces caused in their valiant defense of the Cathedral of the Drowning Saint from the forces of Chaos. Wolsan summarily executed Drecker.
Third War for Armageddon	The Third War for Armageddon[Note 1] was fought in the latter years of M41, fifty-seven years to the day after the Second War for Armageddon. Ghazghkull Thraka was again the leader of the invasion and he was faced by his old nemesis Commissar Yarrick, whom Ghazghkull had let go following his capture at the Battle of Golgotha to make the ensuing invasion more entertaining.[2c][4a] Following his defeat in the Second War for Armageddon at the hands of Commissar Yarrick, Ghazghkull marshaled his forces, licked his wounds, and gathered his strength for a fresh offensive. The Warboss was not deterred in the slightest by his defeat and understood that "to destroy your foe you must first know him." For Ghazghkull, the war for Armageddon had been a way to learn how the Imperium would react and deal with a major invasion. At the same time, his headaches were growing worse and a malaise was manifesting itself. He debated what to do, and was goaded by Grotsnik into returning to Armageddon despite it apparently being a violation of the will of the Gods, who instead wished he take to the stars and unite the Greenskin race. In the end, even Makari tried to talk Ghazghkull out of invading Armageddon again but was (temporarily) killed for it. Ghazghkull decided to ignore the gods and set out his own destiny.[15a] Thus it went that Ghagzhkull began preparations for an even greater invasion of Armageddon.[2b] Over the next few years, Ghazghkull allied with another prominent Ork Warboss, Nazdreg Ug Urdgrub, known for having the best Mekboyz in the galaxy in his employ. Nazdreg's Mekboyz were particularly well known for their tellyporta technology, something Ghazghkull coveted deeply. Thus Ghazghkull struck a deal with Nazdreg, helping him against the Dark Angels during the Battle of Piscina IV in exchange for the secrets of the Tellyporta.[2b]

In the course of doing so, Ziracah foiled a nefarious plot of a traitor gang to sabotage the artificially cooled macro-granaries on the Agri World Bount, in the Coryxx System. The Inquisitor's follow-up investigations afterwards resulted in the executions of several hundred Heretics.
Vetrosus	Vetrosus is a Lord Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos. He believes that the T'au are one of the greatest threats that the Imperium has ever faced, and that the xenos will lead humanity into damnation (citing their advanced technology that makes use of Abominable Intelligences and their silver-tongued diplomats). To this end, Vetrosus has engaged in a number of shadow operations against the T'au Septs in the Chalnath Expanse. Assisting him in these endeavours are requisitioned Space Marines of the Necropolis Hawks and Silver Skulls Chapters.
Epsilon Regalis	Epsilon Regalis is an ill-fated world of the Imperium, made famous by the dreaded Witch Hunter Tyrus, after the ruling elite were accused of heresy. When the Inquisition discovered that the ruling elite of Epsilon Regalis were harboring Warp-spawned abominations, Tyrus instigated a bloody pogrom and purged all those accused of heresy.
Astrid Skane	Astrid Skane is an Ordo Hereticus Inquisitor of the Radical Recongregator faith, who is active in the Calixis Sector. She was formally an Adeptus Arbites Judge, who rooted out a series of pleasure Cults amongst the nobility of Scintilla’s Hives. At that time, Skane had found herself fighting a lonely battle against adversaries wielding power both political and martial, but she persevered in her task. Skane's success (with the aid from several allies of the Inquisition's Tricorn Palace) saw her become famous amongst the Calixis Sector's Holy Ordos. This led her to be inducted into the ranks of the Ordo Calixis as an Acolyte and eventually Skane was elevated to the status of Inquisitor. She now serves in the Ordo Hereticus and has become a Recongregator, who dreams of a future where justice in the Imperium is a rule rather than the exception. Skane also believes that the Tyrant Star's appearance, is due to some sort of Cult activity.
Gründwald	Gründwald is an Ordo Xenos Inquisitor who asked why the Imperium should pay any heed to the deceitful Eldar, when the Xenos were not able to prevent the collapse of their own empire. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Kvalgron	Kvalgron is a Medieval World.
Operative	Operative refers to Human agents of the Alpha Legion. Because of the clandestine and subversive nature of the Alpha Legion, they require a large number of non-augmented humans to conduct acts of espionage, sabotage, subterfuge, and other covert activities during their campaigns. As the Great Crusade ground on, the Alpha Legion made a habit of recruiting non-Astartes specialists in every theatre and campaign they entered, commonly members of the Imperial armed forces, though almost any human could be approached by the Legion for his knowledge or skills. These operatives often remained in their original position, ready to respond to Alpha Legion commands. Compromised operatives were not discarded if it could be avoided, and Alpha Legionaries would go to great lengths to retain them or hide their existence, lengths that included the fatal silencing of other Imperials. Many Operatives were psychically altered by Alpha Legion Librarians to not be aware of their own nature, serving as sleeper agents to be activated when the time was right. One of the ways to identify some Operatives was by their tattoo of a small hydra symbol. However the wearers of the tattoo seem able to make it disappear and reappear at will. At least during the Great Crusade era, Operatives were treated as valued assets as opposed to expendable commodities. Some were even made privy to the truth of Alpha Legion plans and objectives, a level of honesty that not even the brother Primarchs to Alpharius enjoyed. This treatment was not for any sentimental or ethical reasons, but rather stems from the Alpha Legion belief that any and all assets are valuable and it is foolish to needlessly waste them. In fact, Alpha Legionaries tend to recruit those who stumble upon their secrets.[7a] In a dubious account, allegedly penned by Alpharius himself, the Primarch noted that he "detest[ed] waste", and though his Legion was perfectly willing to kill innocents when no other option presented itself, the Alpha Legion preferred to cultivate potentially useful individuals instead of eliminating them.[7b]
Olianthe Rathbone	Olianthe Rathbone is an Inquisitor active in the Calixis Sector. She is not a member of any of the three major Ordos of the Inquisition, instead conducting her own business.

Nonetheless she has a keen intellect and developed a notorious reputation as an Interrogator under Anton Zerbe. She is now known as difficult to know and impossible to befriend. A Radical, Rathbone seeks to purge the Calixis Sector of its irredeemable and bloated nature by stirring up conflict between its ruling families. To that end, she seeks out the mysterious Tyrant Star.
Kaliadh Shayn	Kaliadh Shayn is an Ordo Hereticus Inquisitor, who investigated the so-called Humble Saints in the Talledus System.

Astor Sabbathiel	Astor Sabbathiel is an Inquisitor of the Ordo Hereticus, determined to expose the Dark Angels Chapter as the heretics she believes they are.[1b] Sabbathiel first encountered the Dark Angels on Heorath, where she witnessed one of the Fallen working with daemons in the subterranean caverns. Believing the entire Chapter was corrupt, she vowed to expose their treachery to the Imperium. Five decades later, a daemonhost she keeps in the hold of her ship informed her that the warp-storms shrouding the Calaphrax Cluster had abated in for the first time in ten millennia, and the Dark Angels would seek to obfuscate the truth that might be discovered there.[1a] When she and her retinue arrived in the Exyrion system, they investigated an orbital observation station, discovering the bodies of several Dark Angels fallen in battle.[1c] Sabbathiel identified the cause of death as bolter-fire as her acolyte Fitch detected the impact of the asteroid launched at the surface of Exyrion - and the Iron Warriors fleet that had launched it.[1d] She departed to Quintus, where her daemonhost had shown her visions of a Chaos Cult apparently led by the Dark Angels.[2a] After slaughtering the cultists, she found an ancient suit of black Dark Angels power armour used as an icon of worship, but it fell into a chasm in the fallout from the Battle of Quintus.[2b]
Skane (Inquisitor)	Skane was a Lord Inquisitor, who had the first recorded encounter in the Imperium with a Plague Hulk, after fighting several of them during the 4th Anancus Gamma Counter-Strike. Afterwards, Skane developed an obsession with the Daemon Engines and made it his lifetime's work to ascertain the true nature of the Hulks; he did this with increasing maniacal fervour, as he searched for them wherever the Warp encroached upon the material realm. Some time later, Skane vanished into the Caradryad Warp Fault, while pursing a mission in late 693.M39, and was assumed to have been killed while doing the Emperor's will. His efforts into researching the Plague Hulks did not end with him, however, as following Skane's disappearance several allied peers and Throne agents continued the Inquisitor Lord's work. The results of their studies and reports, are now where the Imperium derives most of the known knowledge about Plague Hulks.

His name... Erebus.
Hallex	Hallex is an Inquisitor in the Ordo Astartes who is among those in the Imperium that have accused the Dark Angels Chapter and their Successors of Legion-building. In the aftermath of the Great Rift's creation, however, the Inquisitor now finds such matters trivial so long as the Dark Angels continue to serve the Emperor. Sometime before the Arks of Omen Campaign, Hallex used a device to determine the location of The Rock at all times. He was unaware that this device carried a malevolent Artificial Intelligence known as the Orac Myriad. This entity was able to later give The Rock's location to Vashtorr, who used it to attack The Rock itself.

However, Thane sympathized with them and also shared Stygies' interest in Xenos technology as well. Thane would later equip himself with some of the Forge World's technology, before disappearing to go hunt Xenos. The Inquisitor and his Retinue now carry specimen canisters for the Xenos they capture. Inquisitor Thane...
Nyxos	An Inquisitor Lord of the Ordo Malleus during the time of the 13th Black Crusade, Nyxos worked closely with the Grey Knights, especially Justicar Alaric. It is reported he has been in service to the Emperor's Inquisition for several centuries. He appears as a tired, frail old man, given to wise-cracking. His frame is supported by a servo-assisted exoskeleton, which in fact makes him much stronger and more resilient than humans a fraction of his age. During the 13th Black Crusade in 999.M41, Nyxos oversaw the Ordo Malleus's response to the threat of the Prince of a Thousand Faces, Ghargatuloth and his impending resurrection into realspace. While meeting with the Grand Masters on Titan, Nyxos suggested that Alaric should lead the assault force against the Daemon Prince. He assigned Inquisitor Ligeia to lead the investigative part of the mission, using her unique psychic abilities to draw information out of records.
Ernst Stavros Killian	Ernst Stavros Killian was a Radical Inquisitor of the Ordo Hereticus. In the 920's M41, Killian learned of the existence of the Shadowlight, an ancient Xenos artefact being studied on Perlia by a joint team of the Ordo Xenos and the Adeptus Mechanicus, which had the power to tap into the energies of the Warp and transform latent psykers into extremely powerful active ones. Killian believed that with the artefact, he could create an army of psykers, powerful enough to finally overthrow and destroy the forces of Chaos.[2b] Commissar Ciaphas Cain, who witnessed the destructive abilities of these enhanced psykers firsthand, later likened Killian's scheme to "burning down the house to kill the termites." Working with Tech Priest Metheius, Killian recruited a force of over-zealous battle-sisters from the Adepta Sororitas, stormed the Shrine on Perlia, killed the researchers and stole the Shadowlight.[2a]
Kadyron Voyage	The Kadyron Voyage was an expedition led by Inquisitor Lord Kadyron into the Hazeroth Abyss. It was a complete disaster, that resulted in the total loss of all forces involved - save one Battle Barge from the Marines Errant Chapter.

Numenoria	Numenoria is an Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos who took part in the Orpheus War and witnessed the Minotaurs Chapter battle the Necrons on the planet Thamyris during the War.
Lemuel Gaumon	Lemuel Gaumon was a remembrancer, specifically a Societal Behaviourist [1a] assigned to the 28th Expedition Fleet under the direction of the Thousand Sons, during the Great Crusade. His natural psychic ability was identified by Magnus the Red and Gaumon later became a neophyte of the Thousand Sons under the tutelage of Ahzek Ahriman. Captured attempting to flee Prospero when the Space Wolves fleet arrived, he spent years imprisoned on Kamiti Sona[2d] before briefly becoming a daemonhost to a shard of Magnus. He then took the name Promeus[2f] and went on to become a founding member of the Inquisition. Lemuel Gaumon was a native of Terra, hailing from the Nordafrik Conclaves.[1b] Prior to becoming a remembrancer, Gaumon was a wealthy business man from Mobayi where he lived on a sizeable estate with his wife, Malika. Gaumon attributed his financial successes to his ability to read people's auras. This gave him the ability to accurately determine the truthfulness of financial offerings from other parties. When his wife became incurably ill, Gaumon refused to accept her mortality and began to conduct research outside of the mainstream. This led him to what was described as more esoteric methods of treatment. Upon the passing of his wife, Gaumon joined the Remembrancer order and petitioned to join the Thousand Sons Expedition. Gaumon commented that his reasoning for joining the Thousand Sons was their rumoured sorcerous abilities and their own history of using these abilities to cure their mutations. Gaumon reasoned that he could learn how to bring his wife back from the grave.[1e] Gaumon was present with the Thousand Sons Legion during their investigation into the mysteries of Twenty-Eight Sixteen. It was during this time period that Gaumon's natural psychic abilities were recognized by Magnus and assigned to Ahriman for further training in the ways of the warp. Gaumon was initially reluctant to admit to possessing these abilities as psykers were not well regarded in the Imperium.[1c] He also joined the Thousand Sons during their campaign alongside the Word Bearers and Space Wolves on Ark Reach Secundus.[1d] He travelled with the fleet to Ullanor and Nikaea, however, he did not witness the activities on those planets first-hand.

Renthor	Renthor was a Radical Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus. He commanded the prison barge the Chains of Judgement, full of captured heretics, when disaster struck. During the Chain's last voyage, Renthor's Daemonhost, Karnak Zul, angered at having been imprisoned by the Inquisitor, used its powers on a weak-willed member of the crew who weakened the Daemon's bonds imprisoning it. Free, but still trapped within its human host, the Daemon went on a rampage, killing the ship's crew and setting its prisoners free. Renthor, along with his right hand Interrogator Crane rallied his Acolytes and the ship's crew to bring down the uprising and regain control of the ship. Karnak Zul would eventually confront the Inquisitor in the ship's armoury, mortally wounding him. Before he died the Inquisitor activated a set of binding wards he had inscribed on the deck of the armoury, binding Karnak Zul in place. Crane was then able to seal the armoury doors, trapping the Daemonhost within.
Zaalin	Zaalin was a Daemonhunter serving with the Angevin Crusade, where she took part in the hunt for the Lord of Change Marabas. The Greater Daemon had been rampaging across what would eventually be known as the Calixis Sector, where it fought the Angevin Crusade's forces and created cults that inspired conquered planets to rebel. Eventually Inquisitor Zaalin located Marabas on the planet Malfi, where she selflessly rammed the hive-spire the Lord of Change occupied with her gun-cutter. In the wake of the devastation, those surviving from Zaalin’s band invoked the rites of banishment, exiling Marabas to the Warp for a thousand years and a day.
Adrielle Quist	Adrielle Quist is an Ordo Xenos Inquisitor, that is active in the Jericho Reach. She was responsible for declaring that the Dragon's Fang was safe for the Jericho Reach's Deathwatch to use, after the Xenos weapon had been held in stasis for a decade.
Pharaa'gueotla	A Daemon Prince from the most ancient times, Pharaa'gueotla had seen galaxies born and die and has destroyed whole star systems for its amusement.[1a] As the newly emergent race of Mankind evolved into a thinking creature, the species' capacity for treachery and guile appealed to the daemon's destructive nature and it settled on ancient Terra to amuse itself. For countless millennia the daemon used its human pawns as mere playthings in its games of mass destruction, that ravaged the surface of Terra. It was with the coming of the God-Emperor that Pharaa'gueotla's terror finally came to an end. Using his first armies of genetically engineered super warriors, the Emperor drove the Daemon Prince from humanity's homeworld. Fleeing across the universe the daemon was finally cornered on the world that would become known as Karis Cephalon. The Emperor, with the help of The Angel, a powerful weapon that he had built himself to destroy mankind's enemies, were able to imprison the daemon in the very bedrock of the planet.[2a] Imprisoned for fifteen thousand years, the daemon was finally awoken by a misguided Inquisitor Lichtenstein, a Radical senior member of the Inquisition, who had been searching for the location of the Librarium Hereticus, a damned collection of forbidden tomes and techno-arcana, a location he believed the imprisoned daemon knew.[1b] Using the powers at his disposal the Inquisitor was able to free a portion of the daemon's consciousnesses from its prison. Awake for the first time in millennia, the Daemon tricked the Inquisitor into trying to unlock a gateway on Karis Cephalon, which would open into the Immaterium and release the daemon completely. Believing his search to finally be at an end, Lichtenstein began to open the gateway, only to be stopped by Inquisitor Kessel, who had been tracking Lichtenstein.[2a]

Originally in the employ of a Rogue Trader, the story of his rise through the Inquisition is hazy and unclear. He was, however, originally a member of the Ordo Xenos before finding his true calling as a Witch Hunter.[1c] Though nominally a Puritan, Kaede is a skilled Psyker and believes that the psychic are the future of the Human race. He is known as an avid Witch Hunter, but he has an eye for talent and will frequently save promising Psykers from Rykehuss' pogroms.[1c]
Kyril Sindermann	Kyril Sindermann was the Primary Iterator of the 63rd Expeditionary Fleet during the latter days of the Great Crusade. He was a gifted speaker and master of rhetoric, and a staunch believer in the secular society and ideals that the Emperor had imposed on the Imperium.[1a] After the Heresy, he took on a new identity as one of the founders of the Inquisition. Sindermann had been the star pupil of the iterator Evander Tobias, who had trained the first iterators and had been intended to serve as Primary Iterator for Warmaster Horus's fleet.

The team's objective was to eliminate the Hive Tyrant, but during the first drop, two members of her team were killed in a Lictor ambush and a third was killed by Zoanthropes. Having escaped that fate, she interviewed an Adeptus Mechanicus survivor from the planet and supposedly killed him after discovering the existence of a secret weapon. Her team was reinforced with Space Marines from the Mantis Warriors Chapter, who had taken heavy losses from an earlier engagement with the Tyranids. With their help, she and the remaining members of her Deathwatch squad discovered and retrieved the weapon, which turned out to be a mix of Imperial and Eldar technology and Tyranid bio-morphs, fused to the body of Inquisitor Grendal.
Stuge	Stuge is an Ordo Xenos Inquisitor who was dispatched by the Inquisition to the world Miskal Prime in the Halo Zone, after an Astropath received a vision that two ancient enemies would clash there in an epic battle. Once Stuge arrived on Miskal Prime though, he discovered a devastated world whose lands were scorched free of life, and was littered with the mutilated dead bodies of the Eldar. The Inquisitor and his retinue eventually discovered a single surviving Eldar, who was close to death and the Xeno told them its Craftworld's forces had clashed with mechanical Xenos to save Miskal Prime. Instead they where overwhelmed and defeated by their ancient foes, who then wiped the world free of life. The Eldar then warned that its Craftworld's defeat foretold that their foes would go on to cause widespread destruction, that would spread out from Miskal Prime. Before Inquisitor Stuge could learn more, however, the Eldar died from its wounds. Afterwards, the Inquisition harvested the Eldar's tech from Miskal Prime's dead landscape, but they could find no evidence of the mechanical Xenos, the Eldar had fought.
Daemonic possession	Daemonic Possession is the act of the essence of a Daemon possessing and controlling the body of another being. As Daemons can only exist in the Materium for a limited period before being forced back into the Warp, Daemonic Possession is one of the most common methods for Daemons to enter the material realm. Daemonic Possession can occur involuntarily to those of psychic potential, but the host sometimes willingly gives themselves over to Daemonic Possession, as is the case with Possessed Chaos Space Marines and certain Cultists. Possessed individuals can often be used as gateways to the Warp, allowing Daemons to spill into the Materium. Corpses can also be possessed by Daemons and are known as Corporeal Hosts[3b]. Chaos icons can be used to achieve this, which will place the Corporeal Hosts in the control of the icons' wielder. Dedicating these icons to specific Chaos Gods, will ensure only their Daemons possess the corpses. However if the icon is destroyed, then the Daemons will be banished and the corpses will collapse once more.[3a]

She is among those that have warned about the significant increase of Imperial Unsanctioned Psykers appearing, due to the effects of the Great Rift. According to Praxia, the scale of this disaster could not be overstated, as the mind of an untrained Psyker is incapable of containing the power of the Warp. She claims they will ultimately break under the strain and in doing so, the Psykers will become prey to Daemons. The Inquisitor believes the Imperium must now find and destroy all of its Unsanctioned Psykers or it risks being consumed by Chaos. Praxia has also stated that those Imperials who believe the Imperium Sanctus is safe from danger are fools. She claims that one only has to look at how easily the Nephilim Sector fell to the Necrons, to see how ignorant they are to claim it is a safe haven.
Blooded Hand	The Blooded Hand is a blood-crazed Khornate Chaos Cult that is led by the Arch Deacon Krage and have recently summoned the Bloodthirster Skarbrand from the Warp. Now the Cult is fighting beside the Greater Daemon as it begins to rampage across a Sector of space, intent on drowning it in blood.

Vincenze Farradocias Kazymar	Vincenze Farradocias Kazymar is a Radical Ordo Malleus Inquisitor, who has been declared a Heretic. His downfall began, when he gained the aid of the Blessed Daemon Cult, in summoning the Prr'xakkatos Daemonhost into Realspace. Kazymar later unleashed the Prr'xakkatos to save Jhorvia V, from an invasion by the Festerlung Brotherhood Warband. As the Daemons and Warband fought, the Inquisitor then sought to destroy them with an orbital bombardment from his Cruiser Blade Inevitable. However it was driven off by a barrage from the Hammerblow; an Imperial Navy Battleship, under the command of the Ordo Malleus Inquisitor Danicha Hest. Kazymar then fled, but Jhorvia V was left in ruins, as the Festerlung and Prr'xakkatos continued their battle. Inquisitor Hest meanwhile, began seeking evidence that Kazymar was responsible for unleashing the Daemonhost and traced its summoning back to the Blessed Daemon. Before the Cult was destroyed by her forces, Hest gained a confession of Kazymar's guilt and she now seeks to kill the fallen Inquisitor.

Hives now cover more than 70% of its surface, including what is left of its oceans.[3a] One of its greatest sights for the visitor is the kilometre-wide Avenue of the Victor Bellum which runs almost to the centre of the Hive and ends in the Spatian Gate. The gate is constructed of glossy white aethercite. It is so large that the Dome in its ceiling has its own local weather pattern; even Titans are said to be able to pass through it without bending.[3b] When Hive Ferax fell prey to a cannibal Cult uprising in 071.M41, a number of nearby Space Marine Chapters mustered a strike force in response and under Force Commander Zha'Khan, of the Marauders Chapter, they deployed to the wastes near the embattled Hive and waited. Once the Cult had scoured Hive Ferax of its population, the hunger-maddened cannibals surged forth from the Hive in a vast horde in search of more food - only to find themselves under the massed guns of the strike force, who opened fire and destroyed the Cult.

The investigation eventually tracked Quixos to Farness Beta and Raum was among the Inquisition's forces that confronted the traitor. In the battle that followed though, Raum was beheaded by Quixos.[1a]
Sepheris Secundus	Sepheris Secundus is an Imperial Mining[1a] and Feudal World.[3a] Sepheris Secundus is a world of immense mineral wealth, city-sized mines, billions-strong hordes of serfs and the sharpest divide between the elites and the masses in the Calixis Sector. It is a grim place of snow and twilight, feral mutants, and lives spent in back-breaking labour deep beneath the ground. The Imperium's eagerness to exploit Sepheris Secundus's vast resources is such that the planet is, at the same time, the richest and poorest world in the sector. Sepheris Secundus's climate is cold and stormy, its surface obscured by a mantle of cloud. It has no oceans save for the small polar seas, so the moisture in its atmosphere comes from below the crust, spewed out from failed mine workings or natural geysers that pockmark the planet like pustules. Its surface is split between the vast open mines like deep scars in the crust and the dense, snow laden forests broken only by the ruins of failed kingdoms that tried to claim Sepheris Secundus in the past. With its endless blizzards, widespread ignorance and antiquated methods for doing everything, Sepheris Secundus would be a meaningless backwater were it not for the enormous mineral wealth beneath its surface.
Luce Spinoza	Luce Spinoza is the Interrogator for the Ordo Hereticus Inquisitor Lord, Erasmus Crowl. Prior to that, she was the Interrogator for the Ordo Hereticus Inquisitor Lord Joffen Tur, who she greatly admired despite his many faults. Spinoza ambitiously hoped to one day follow in Tur's footsteps and develop a reputation that was half as formidable as his was. She worked tirelessly to meet the great expectations that Tur held for his retinue, but the Inquisitor Lord never hesitated to tell the Interrogator where her skills were lacking. This occurred even when Tur took part in aiding the Imperium's forces, that fought to end the rebellion, on Forfoda. Tur though wanted to learn why the world's Planetary Governor, rebelled against the Imperium, but the Imperial Fists presence on Forfoda would make that difficult. They had begun destroying rebel held buildings, in an attempt to end the rebellion, and the Governor's building would soon be one of them. In order to ensure the Governor was not killed, Tur led most of his retinue to capture the rebel's leader. However, he had learned though, that an Imperial Fists squadron, under the command of the Chaplain Erastus, was also going to attack the rebellion's second in command, the Governor's Adjutant Naiao Servia. In order to ensure she was brought in alive, Tur ordered Spinoza to accompany the Imperial Fists and in doing also sought to strengthen the Interrogator's conventional combat abilities, which she lacked in. When they both launched their attacks, though, it was discovered that the rebellion's leadership had fallen to heresy and worshiped the Chaos God Nurgle. They now faced rebels infected with Nurgle's foul power, and in battle with Servia's forces, the infected adjutant disarmed Erastus and nearly killed the Chaplain. With the rest of the squadron unable to reach him in time, Spinoza acted quickly by grabbing the Chaplain's fallen Crozius Arcanum and swung a blow that broke Servia's spine.
Semyth	Semyth is an Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos. According to rumours among the Conclaves of the Fordan Sector, Semyth attempted, via extensive surgery (including memory-engram implantation), to impersonate a Dvorgite Flensewright. Based on Semyth's last, desperate vox-report, if these rumours are to be believed, then his attempts were unsuccessful and ended extremely badly.
Golesh Heldane	Golesh Constantine Pheppos Heldane[2d] was an Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus. He was a powerful psyker and a pupil of Inquisitor Commodus Voke in 240.M41. In his youth, Heldane was a staunch Puritan like his master Voke, but became a Radical in his later years. Inquisitor Gregor Eisenhorn first encountered Heldane in 240.M41, while undercover during the investigation of House Glaw on Gudrun. Heldane's master, Commodus Voke, reluctantly agreed to allow Eisenhorn to pursue his more subtle approach, but insisted on Heldane accompanying Eisenhorn's retinue.[2a] This nearly ended in disaster when Eisenhorn and his retinue were exposed, tortured, and put into the Glaws' arena to be slaughtered by Carnodons. Heldane was savagely mauled, but nonetheless managed to kill one of the Carnodons with a poleaxe, and survived.[2b] Several months later, Eisenhorn encountered Heldane at Voke's side, aboard the Inquisitorial ship Saint Scythus, grimly noting the livid scars covering his entire head.[2c] When Eisenhorn and Voke conducted an auto-seance, psychically interrogating House Glaw's ally Girolamo Malahite, Voke was badly wounded when they made their escape from Malahite's collapsing mind, which summoned a daemon from the warp as a final act of spite. Voke asked Eisenhorn to take Heldane under his wing if Voke died, and sponsor his eventual elevation to full Inquisitor. However, Voke survived and later elevated Heldane to the rank of Inquisitor himself.[2d] His elevation came approximately 40 years later, in or around 278.M41.[3a]
Kal Jerico	Kal Jerico (in some sources - Jericho) is the most famous bounty hunter in Necromunda's Hive Primus. Born the son of Necromunda's Planetary Governor Gerontius Helmawr and Inquisitor Heleana Jerico (which she later described as "just one of the many disagreeable things one has to do for the greater good of the Imperium"), Kal left the luxury of the spire for the life of a bounty hunter in the Underhive. As well as hunting those with bounties on their heads, Jerico often has a bounty on his own due to his unorthodox methods, leading as often as not to trouble finding him. He resolves these situations using his trademark debonair swashbuckling style, relying on quick wits and his good luck more than brute strength.
Derelei Melcho	Derelei Melcho is an Ordo Militarum Inquisitor of the Sanctus Entente Cabal, which seeks to combat Abaddon the Despoiler's efforts to collapse the Sanctus Wall.
Logicians	The Logicians are a heretical alliance of factions that are known to operate in both the Calixis and Ixaniad Sectors. This organization did not form through either a dark religion or a charismatic leader but instead gained popularity with individuals who managed to secure the forbidden (and heretical) text known as "In Defence of the Future: A Logical Discourse" which had been banned for millennia. Its members consider themselves to be a progressive cult who favour the advancement of mankind through progress as well as the acquisition of technology. They further believe that they need to cast off the oppression of the Adeptus Ministorum, overthrow the rule of the High Lords of Terra and end the constraints imposed by the Adeptus Mechanicus. This is because the Logicians' ultimate aim is to bring back the great power Mankind held during the mythic times of the Dark Age of Technology. They are known to find disciples through a secret network of ruthless mercantile interests as well as by power-hungry nobles. In addition, the ranks of the Logicians prove to be a safe haven for Hereteks and rogue Techpriests. Whilst there exists no Daemonic force within this heretical organization or an apocalyptic plan, they are still as a dangerous group. Their infamous actions have led them to become utterly callous in the pursuit of power as well as the never-ending search for better tools as well as weapons through which they can achieve their goals.
Kekrops	Lord Inquisitor Kekrops of the Ordo Hereticus came to the planet Opis to purge the government for allowing the worship of Chaos. Kekrops and his retinue came under attack inside a building, as he was interrogating members of the Aristeia, Opis' nobility caste, in one of its cities. As they escaped, they were overwhelmed by a large group of what appeared to be off-world soldiers. Kekrops and a majority of his retinue were killed and his attackers disappeared.[1a] In response to Kektrops' death, the Inquisition called down the Imperial Guard on Opis. The killers of an Lord Inquisitor had to be rooted out and punished, and Opis’s government torn out and replaced.[1b]
Daemonfury	The Daemonfury is a Daemonic plasma gun belonging to the Blood Ravens Chapter. The Radical Inquisitor Restrepo bound a foul daemon of jealousy within this weapon. Spiteful toward his fellow fiends, the bound entity makes this weapon highly effective against daemons.
Blood Debt (Short Story)	Blood Debt is a short story in the Blood Angels novel series by James Swallow. Inquisitor Ramius Stele is desperate to escape a world being consumed by the dread forces of Chaos. As the corrupting influence of the Ruinous Powers threatens to consume his soul, salvation arrives in the form of Captain Erasmus Tycho and the Blood Angels. But Stele is hiding a deadly secret, and if the Blood Angels discover it, his life – and soul – will be forfeit. How far will the inquisitor go to hide the truth?
Vaskiel	Vaskiel is an Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos. Vaskiel once sent a Kill-Team of the Deathwatch, led by Captain Polino, to a Desert World that was contested between the Imperium and the Tau Empire. While there, the Kill-Team found that the Kroot that had been reinforcing Tau forces on the planet had undergone hybridisation with Tyranid genes. After they had extracted themselves, Zaeus was certain that Vaskiel's response would be to declare Exterminatus.
Rasmusarii	Rasmusarii is an Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos. After witnessing the annexation of the T'sakari Worlds, she believes that the worst foes to Humanity are the Kin of the Leagues of Votann. She became convinced in particular after Kin voidships destroyed the Imperial capital world; the xenos started processing the shattered world even as the battle still raged, killing millions of Imperial Guardsmen and simply ejecting their ruined meat as if it was an afterthought. Since the T'sakari Worlds massacre, Rasmusarii has convened the Conclave of Vengeance and she and her allies have led forces in an expedition into the Galactic Core to face the Kin directly. In addition to a number of other Puritan Inquisitors, and the surviving Astra Militarum officers from the regiments that were slaughtered at T'sakari, her inner circle includes the Rogue Trader Pavel Greth and Borhess (a Lord of House Hawkshroud).
Sturmhex Incident	The Sturmhex Incident was a battle fought between the Space Marines of the Grey Knights First Brotherhood and Chaos Space Marines of the Lords of Decay. The Prognosticars of the Grey Knights Chapter directed the First Brotherhood to the planet Sturmhex Prime, where a warband of the Lords of Decay, led by First Captain Roga, were enacting a ritual to summon the Daemon Prince Anahk'hir. The Daemon Prince had promised The Despoiler a foothold in the Materium from which to launch a Black Crusade and planned to use the dying star Sturmhex to open a rift into the Warp. Arriving in the system aboard the Castigator, Grand Master Vardan Kai deployed the entire First Brotherhood using a squadron of Stormraven Gunships, an undertaking of normally unprecedented scale for the Brotherhood. Descending into the planet's depths via its subterranean tunnel networks, the Grey Knights were able to use the Stormravens' superior manoeuvrability to their advantage to disrupt the Chaos forces within the caverns. Grey Knights Terminator Squads led by Brother-Captain Cadrig Pelenas were deployed to fight against the Lords of Decay and their summoned Daemon allies, while the gunships provided invaluable fire support. Anahk'hir, however, had planned for this, hoping to exact revenge on the Grey Knight who had banished him in their last encounter.
Merrinus	Merrinus is an Inquisitor of the Askellon Sector, who is known to have argued with Inquisitor Byphon, about which of the Ordos is most important to the safety of the Imperium.
Atoma Prime	Atoma Prime is a desert Hive World and capital world of the Moebian Domain. Hive Tertium is the centre of civilisation and industry on this planet, housing nearly its entire population.[15a] Atoma Prime and the wider Moebian Domain is ruled by the Lord Moebian, an office currently held by Lord Constance Margrave.[15a] The current Lord Margrave of Atoma is the 13th successive member of House Margrave to hold this office since M36. As the centre of the Moebian Domain, Atoma Prime is of great importance to the regional Imperial presence. Their industrial output of Leman Russ Battle Tanks and other armour is paramount to the security of the domain. In M41, the Moebian Domain's borders have been beset by various Chaos and Xenos threats, locally referred to as the "Darktide". These threats come from beyond the Moebian Fringe Regions, areas that border hostile Wilderness Space. Defence against the Darktide in the Fringe War is of paramount importance for the domain. Atoma Prime has raised many regiments over the millennia to attempt to hold the Darktide at bay, keeping Atoma Prime and the core worlds of the domain safe, for now.
Rex	Rex was an Arbitrator with a long career in service to the Inquisition, when he narrowly averted the destruction of an entire hive spire while on a mission to the planet Fenksworld. As a result of successful actions, Rex's Inquisitor master raised the former Acolyte to become an Inquisitor himself.
Halo Device	Halo Devices are xenos artefacts discovered amidst the ruins of ancient alien worlds in the Halo Stars. The devices use a process completely beyond the understanding of Imperial lore to manipulate the body and mind of those they bond with, making their hosts extremely difficult to kill and effectively immortal. However, the price paid is madness, loss of humanity, and strange thirsts and addictions such as the need to consume blood and flesh. The worlds from which Halo Devices are found are truly ancient and utterly lifeless, orbiting dead stars that must have burned their brightest many thousands of millennia ago. They are usually found buried in the decayed basalt biers and shattered cyclopean ruins of their maker’s civilization. That such worlds were once part of some long dead civilization, believed to predate even the Eldar, is generally agreed upon by xeno-arcanists and Rogue Traders, but just what the creatures from this civilization were or how they passed into extinction is a question that has never been answered. Possessed of strange and potent properties, Halo Devices can fetch high prices within the Imperium where collectors covet their ability to empower the human form and defeat even mortality itself. Possession of such dangerous xeno archeotech is highly heretical. The devices have been condemned by both the Ordo Xenos and the Adeptus Mechanicus, and the lives of those in possession of a Halo Device are forfeit within the Imperium. Even with all the risk involved, there is a secret trade in such items to corrupt members of the elite and the wealthy of the Imperium. Knowing the risks of the devices, the Inquisition has watched the sectors around the Halo Stars for any sign of those who trade in them for centuries.
Kage	Lieutenant Kage is an officer of the 13th Penal Legion. Kage is notable for being the only member to have entered the 13th Penal Legion thrice—conscripted in initially due to shooting his sergeant over a woman,[2a] being pardoned after completing the mission,[2b] then subsequently arrested once more for a second murder,[3a] falling to his assumed death, and finally voluntarily placing himself under Colonel Schaeffer's command indefinitely. During his time in the so-called "Last Chancers", Kage became the senior ranked penal officer, was assigned training and administrative duties as well as field leadership, and took part in several extremely hazardous missions. A latent psyker of minor ability, he was once believed to have become possessed by a daemonic entity during a mission to the world of Armageddon, and to have perished falling into lava—though in the process ensuring the doom of the traitorous Overlord Herman von Strab. He was later found to have survived, crediting his survival and lack of subsequent possession to the Emperor, and later rejoined Colonel Schaeffer's command to save Armageddon from daemonic incursion.
Tymer Quintarus	Tymer Quintarus was an Inquisitor, who was active in the Gilead System and continued to defend it, after the Great Rift left the System isolated from the Imperium.[1b] However, while tracking down Heretics on one of the System's Hive Worlds, Quintarus and his retinue were ambushed by their foes and massacred. When the attack was over, only his Death Cult Assassin Emerah still lived, though more heretics would soon arrive. Outnumbered and alone, the Assassin began making her way to the flotilla of the Rogue Trader Jakel Varonius, which was the first step of the contingency plan that Quintarus had created in the event of his death. Before she successfully escaped, though, Emerah had collected a memento from each of her dead comrades, so their shades could watch over her, and she took Quintarus' Inquisitorial Rosette with her.[1a]
Briseis Ligeia	Briseis Ligeia was an Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus who was instrumental in the banishing of the Daemon Prince Ghargatuloth in 999.M41. Briseis Ligeia was born from nobility, taken from the planet Gathalamor by the Ordo Hereticus because of her psychic abilities. Her particular talent was the ability to absorb information, through extrasensory means at a rate much faster than an ordinary human could read books or data files. Combined with her memory and logically ordered mind, this made her a superlative researcher, especially at deciphering ancient or cryptic texts. For this ability, she was headhunted by the Ordo Malleus, where she continued to hone her abilities, and eventually was promoted to full Inquisitor. While studying the personal effects of rogue Inquisitor Gholic Ren-Sar Valinov, she stumbled upon the Codicium Aeternum, which had been presumed lost after Valinov had stolen it from the Malleus. Based on the information inside, she petitioned the Grey Knights for an expedition to the Trail of Saint Evisser, predicting that the Daemon Prince Ghargatuloth was preparing to re-manifest itself. Although the Knights were severely shorthanded, having deployed the majority of their chapter to combat the 13th Black Crusade around the Cadian Gate, a small strike force was formed led by Justicar Alaric to assist the Inquisitor.
Headhunted (Short Story)	Headhunted is a Deathwatch short story written by Steve Parker. A squad of Deathwatch Space Marines, the Imperium's elite alien fighters, land on an ork space craft to investigate a mysterious new threat. Fighting their way through the greenskin-infested vessel, they encounter something beyond their expectations, something that threatens to destroy them all. Can they defeat this monstrous enemy and survive? Unnamed Ork ship converted from an Imperial Magellan-Class transport, The Pegasus, in the Charybdis Subsector.
Talon (Kill-team)	Kill-team Talon was the operational codename for a Deathwatch Kill-team under the command of an Inquisitor known only as Sigma. Current records only provide information concerning two known actions of Kill-team Talon. The first took place aboard an Ork spaceship of indeterminate class. The vessel, converted from an Imperial transport ship once called the Pegasus, was a salvager, under the command of an Ork named Bathazog Bludwrekk. Talon were tasked by their Inquisitor to take Bludwrekk's head. (Literally: the goal of the mission was to decapitate Bludwrekk and recover his cranium.)
Hand of Darkness	The Hand of Darkness is an ancient Xenos artefact that was present on the world of Purgatory in the Gothic Sector. Its existence was known only to a select few within the Inquisition though none truly knew the nature or purpose of the artefact. The records of older species such as the Eldar, speak of the Hand of Darkness with utter revulsion. It was believed that the artefact was a weapon of immeasurable power, though the manner in which it manifested this power was a mystery. Inquisitor Thadus Valconet Horst was dispatched to locate the Hand of Darkness, deep beneath Purgatory, but the worst fears of the Inquisition came true - the artefact was gone. There were worries that the forces of Chaos had spirited the weapon away and that they would unleash its destructive potential on the galaxy. Abaddon the Despoiler later took possession of the Hand of Darkness during the Gothic War and its powers were finally revealed to the Imperium. The ancient artefact is infused with the atrophying power of the Warp and decays anything that its wielder touches. Abaddon used this decaying power to gain access to the Blackstone Fortresses, which he later took control of. However, he has since surrendered the Hand of Darkness to the Daemon Prince Mortarion, in order to secure the allegiance of the Death Guard for the 13th Black Crusade.
Mallen	Mallen was a Captain in the Blood Angels Chapter.
Vincorum	Vincorum is an Ordo Hereticus Inquisitor who led the Sisters of Battle against the Coven of Thecula V in order to capture its Rogue Psyker leader, Baroness Apocrypha. They successfully did so, but instead of immediately executing Apocrypha, Vincorum imprisoned her within a Incarcerator‎. This was because Inquisitor Lord Karamazov had specifically decreed that he would have the honour of burning Apocrypha after she was tried for her crimes at the Imperial Cathedral on Salem Proctor. However, before she could be transported off of Thecula V, the remaining members of Apocrypha's Cult launched an attack on Vincorum's forces in an attempt to free her.
Thaddeus Hakk	Thaddeus Hakk is a Radical Lord Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos. Having worked in the Calixis Sector for over a century, early in his career became involved with a Radical faction of Ocularians. He eventually learned the Ocularians divination ability and used it to defeat a xenos spectre of a long dead race. In the aftermath of the battle Thaddeus lost his foresight, and he wandered the Koronus Expanse for several years where he descended into insanity. He may still wander the Sector, mad but perhaps upholding his duties as an Inquisitor.
Coronis	Coronis is an Imperium World that has been invaded by Hive Fleet Scarabus and is being defended by several Imperial Guard Regiments. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here. The name Coronis might be inspired by one of several characters from Greek mythology bearing that name.
Plasma Gun	Plasma gun is a generic term for a two-handed, rifle-like, plasma based weapon used by the forces of the Imperium as well as Chaos in a support role. An uncommon weapon, even in the ranks of the Imperial Guard or Adeptus Astartes, most extant plasma guns are hundreds if not thousands of years old. As a testament to their design, they remain as deadly today as the day of their fabrication.[23c]. Aesthetically they appear to be stubby and rather clunky, with a ribbed back and flared cooling vents along the front. Hydrogen flasks stick out of the butt and bottom of the weapon. These flasks generally contain enough fuel for at least 10 shots before needing to be replaced. As an alternative to using plasma flasks, a plasma gun can also use a backpack with a feed line.
Black Bone Road (Graphic Novel)	Black Bone Road is a short graphic novel, written by Graham McNeill and illustrated by Jonathan Standing. It was originally published in Issue #44 of Inferno! Magazine in 2004, and re-published in Ultramarines: The Second Omnibus. Epsilon Regalis was the crown jewel of the Formosa sector. Loyal, civilised, everything a world of the Imperium should be. However, it has turned from the Emperor's light for some unknown reason. Warriors of the Ultramarines' 4th Company, led by Captain Idaeus, are sent to investigate the turmoil that had affected this world. Idaeus, a contingent of Assault Marines, and the then-veteran sergeant Uriel Ventris were to attack the centre of the rebellion with the assistance of Inquisitor Markhov. While this was occurring, veteran sergeants Pasanius and Learchus were also headed to the battle within Rhino transports escorted by Predator Annihilators.
Vogen	Khai-Zhan is an Agri World in the Segmentum Obscurus. The planet was the site of the Khai-Zhan Uprising. The planet is of vital strategic value to both the forces of Chaos and the Imperium due to its location along a warp route within the Cadian Gate and being within close proximity of the Eye of Terror. Khai-Zhan is a water-world with 98.3% of its surface covered in shallow oceans, and possesses only one substantial landmass. The environment of the planet is noted to be particularly stable due to having little tectonic and tidal activity. The latter is a result of having two moons that are both distant and of low mass. Thus, any disturbances to the world's single continent and massive oceans are minimal.
Blood in the Machine (Short Story)	Blood in the Machine is a Flesh Tearers audio drama by Andy Smillie in the Space Marine Battles novel series, released in July 2013. On the war-torn world of Armageddon, Gabriel Seth and his Flesh Tearers accompany an Imperial inquisitor and her retinue on a mission of vital importance. But the inquisitor has a hidden agenda that could imperil not only Seth's mission, but the very existence of his Chapter... unless he takes drastic action.
The Blood Purge of Crixos	The Blood Purge of Crixos was a devastating invasion of Crixos, by the Black Legion and their Daemon allies, that left the Hive World in ruins. During the invasion the Legion destroyed Crixos' Hives and massacred its population, until soon only a single Hive remained standing. Hearing the pleas for aid from the terrified population, a battlegroup[1a], led by the Ordo Malleus Inquisitor Caspiel Rex and Captain Thoul of the Minotaurs Chapter[1b], was hastily dispatched to halt the invaders no matter the cost.[1a] The battlegroup, composed of the Imperial Guard, Minotaurs Chapter and the Freeblade Knight Crucible of Wrath, landed near the last remaining Hive; as the Legion advanced upon it, to kill the remaining population of Crixos inside. Though the battle with the Black Legion was fierce, and the Daemon Prince Vorarr summoned numerous Daemons from the Warp to aid them, the battlegroup defeated the Legion's forces and saved what remained, amongst the ruins of Crixos for the Imperium.[1c]
Paragon III	Paragon III is an Imperium Industrial World that, sometime after the Great Rift's creation, suffered an invasion of Donorian Fiends when a spur of the Webway tore open. This was followed by Dark Eldar raiding parties, who took advantage of the chaos the Fiends were spreading across the world. Hoping to imitate the daring Kryptman Gambit, Inquisitor Re'hneton tried to lure a Tyranid splinter fleet down to eradicate the invading Xenos, but he relied on a tenuous web of alliances to do so. When the Inquisitor then failed to deliver upon his own pledges of fealty, his alliances collapsed and Re'hneton inadvertently caused a catastrophe of system-wide proportions, as the splinter fleet advanced on its own.
Ostromandeus	Ostromandeus is a mysterious Psychic Ordo Hereticus Inquisitor. An uncompromising servant of the Emperor, Ostromandeus is relentless in his duties and crusades to purge the Galaxy of Heretics. He hunts down heresy with unyielding fury and no Traitor can escape the Inquisitor's wrath. Ostromandeus is even willing to burn entire worlds to ensure this does not occur. Ostromandeus is notable for his persecution of cultists on the planet Caldassa. He and his retinue quietly made planetfall and seized control of Caldassa's vox-fortress. After wiring his vox-servitor, Stentor-I-52, into the fortress's systems, he instructed the servitor to broadcast a continual series of bombastic orations, which were then blasted through the vox-networks of every one of the planet's hives. The heretics' morale was broken. By the time Imperial forces arrived to secure Caldassa, many on both sides had been driven mad by the ceaseless castigations; nevertheless Caldassa was returned to the Imperial fold.
Schongard	Schongard was an Inquisitor who was among those, that charged Inquisitor Eisenhorn with Heresy, during the Necroteuch affair[1a]. He was also among the Imperial forces that fought House Glaw, as they attempted to resurrect the Heretic Pontius Glaw.[1b]
Fabiranice Var Koldenvaal	It is the great fortune of most who dwell within the Imperium that they possess not the imagination to picture even a fragment of the horrors that lurk within the warp. Should those same horrors be unleashed upon them, however, this shield of ignorance collapses all too swiftly and, in its demise, often destroys the mind it once protected. Truly it is nobler to purge all such unfortunates for the good of all, than to force them to live on in enlightened insanity. "-Inquisitor Fabiranice Var Koldenvaal, ruminations on Exterminatus Fabiranice Var Koldenvaal is an Inquisitor.
Drex	Drex is an Imperial planet. At one point, a Chaos Cult arose on this planet which persuaded the local people to stop the mass production. The cult was suppressed by Inquisitor Gerhart and the Vindicare Assassin Tarim.
Emeline Smythe	Emeline Smythe is a Cadian Ordo Hereticus Inquisitor, who was once a Guardsmen until she was selected to join an Inquisitor's retinue and later reached her current position in the Ordo.[1a] Following the creation of the Great Rift, she has become one of the many Imperial forces that were now defending the Gilead System from any threats[1a]. One such threat occurred within Charybdion's Ironwatch prison, which was used to hold the world's psykers, until they were collected by the League of Black Ships. Unfortunately, the Great Rift had caused the Gilead System to be surrounded by Warp Storms, which prevented the Black Ships from entering the System. This had led to a build up of psykers, whose powers eventually overwhelmed Ironwatch's safeguards and began affecting the population of the Hive Aidon, which the prison was outwardly attached to. Because of the influence of the psykers, riots had begun breaking out within the Hive and, after being unable to contact anyone inside the prison, Smythe had led her retinue into Ironwatch, in order to switch on several failsafes that would detach the prison from the Hive and send it plunging into Charybdion's ocean. However the situation within Ironwatch was worse than she had anticipated, as the psykers' powers had freed many of them from their cells and also caused a Warp breach, that had allowed Daemons of Slaanesh to run rampant within the prison. As a result of this, the majority of Ironwatch's staff and guards had either been killed by the Daemons or psykers and so Smythe and her retinue now had to fight their way through them to reach each of the failsafes. As they began their task, Smythe became aware that a group of Eldar were also in the prison and luckily, due to her keen mind and sharp intellect, the Inquisitor knew how to speak the Xenos' language. Though both were wary of each other, time was of the essence and Smythe was more than willing to work with the Eldar, in order to end the threat that the prison posed to the Hive. After a brief parlay both sides came to an agreement: the Eldar would to destroy one of Ironwatch's failsafes, so that Smythe could reach the next one in her path, and the Inquisitor would give the Eldar intel, on where to find the imprisoned psyker Konrad Boyer, who the Xenos had been sent to kill. The groups then parted ways[1b], though, the Eldar kept their end of the deal and destroyed the failsafe, which allowed the Inquisitor to continue her mission[1c]. This more than likely furthered Smythe's radical belief, that in the aftermath of the Great Rift's creation, the Imperium and Eldar should form a permanent alliance, in order to combat the overwhelming threats that now plagued both of their species.[1a] The Dark Tides' RPG adventures Twisted Strands and Ironwatch tell the same general story, with players dealing with the corrupted prison, from two different perspectives. In Twisted Strands, the players are Eldar that encounter Inquisitor Smythe, while in Ironwatch the players are Imperials sent to destroy the prison. As Ironwatch ends with the Imperials successfully sending the prison into the ocean, it is likely, but unconfirmed, that Smythe succeeded in doing the same, in Twisted Strands.
Lucretia Bravus	Lucretia Bravus is an Enforcer of the Adeptus Arbites. An Enforcer hunt team leader, she was recruited for the pacification of an anti-Imperial group known as the Brotherhood of Deliverance on the planet Gabrydon. Her mission was to find the location of the enemy encampments and capture prisoners to be interrogated for information on the rebels. Over the course of her mission, Bravus came to the attention of Inquisitor Hammenstein who absorbed her into his retinue. Hammenstein was impressed by her performance during the battle, such as when she was the sole survivor of a deadly ambush but nonetheless tracked down the enemy survivors as opposed to returning to base. Vastly outnumbered, she killed the rebels but still managed to capture three for interrogation.
Kessel	Kessel is an Inquisitor and ex-Daemonhost once possessed by the Daemon Loa Gorg who now unwillingly serves him as a Daemonhost. A part of Loa Gorg's essence remained within Kessel and forced the Daemon to cooperate with the Inquisitor, since his death would result in the release this soul-fragment and the destruction of the Daemon. This state of affairs lasted for three decades, the daemonic presence corrupting Kessel more and more. This would eventually have killed Kessel but he finally managed to transfer the soul-fragment into a Daemonsword that the Inquisitor now wields. This weapon extend his life as long as he is in possession of it, and he has been purging the unclean and researching Chaos for nearly two centuries. He has frequently crossed paths with the fellow Inquisitors Tyrus and Lichtenstein, each vying for him for their own ends. After Lichtenstein saved Kessel from Tyrus' prison at Cephalon Spaceport, the Daemonhost granted Lichtenstein safe passage to Equinox.
Gideon Ravenor	Gideon Ravenor was a renowned Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos in the 4th century of M41. Initially a protege of the infamous Gregor Eisenhorn, Ravenor suffered crippling injuries during an ambush on Thracian Primaris, and was confined to a suspensor chair for the remainder of his life. His confinement only boosted his already formidable psyker abilities, and he continued his Inquisitorial career. Despite Ravenor's success in dealing with numerous xenos, heretic, and daemonic threats to the Imperium, he was best remembered for his philosophical writings, including The Spheres of Longing, for centuries after his death.[3a] His mentor, Eisenhorn, commented on the irony that Ravenor would not have become such a renowned intellect had he not been confined by his injuries.[2d] Ravenor began his Inquisitorial career as an Interrogator for the renowned Gregor Eisenhorn, who privately noted that Ravenor excelled at every assignment he was given, and predicted that the young man's promotion to full Inquisitor was not far away.[2a][2b]
Geromius Staanberg	Geromius Staanberg is an Ordo Xenos High Inquisitor, who is active in the Chinchare Subsector. He was among the Imperium's forces that took part in the Dark Crusade's Kith Campaign, against the Asuryani and Drukhari that invaded the Chinchare Subsector in the wake of the Thirteenth Black Crusade. During the Campaign, Staanberg sent his Interrogator Janus Dubois to investigate the numerous raids the Xenos conducted on the Imperial world Orthrea. Dubois, however, could not determine a pattern to the attacks, which occurred on sites of varying value, and the Interrogator then awaited further orders from Staanberg. Sometime later, though, the Imperium's forces in the Kith Campaign defeated the invading Asuryani and Drukhari.
Death Company	The Death Company is a special unit unique to the Blood Angels and their Successor Chapters, consisting of former Battle-Brothers who have succumbed to the Black Rage.[1a][1b] On the eve of battle, the Blood Angels pray and remember the sacrifice of their Primarch Sanguinius while the Chaplains bless and study each battle-brother for signs of the Black Rage. Those who collapse into the Chaplains' arms during the chanting of the moripatris are taken away to form the Death Company. Their Power Armour is repainted black with a blood red saltire symbolizing the wounds of Sanguinius and hung with devotional scrolls and records of honours earned before the madness took them. From this point on, these battle-brothers are considered dead men walking.[1b] It is known that before the battle members of the Death Company gain access to the Chapter armoury so they may fight their last fighting with a weapon of their choice. Captains who fall to the Black Rage, are granted the use of relic weapons and violently slaughter their foes as they seek death in battle.[14e] Consumed by the Black Rage, the Death Company fights without fear, heedless of the quality of their opposition or the wounds they suffer. Under the watchful eye of their Death Company Chaplains,[1b] or particularly strong-willed scions of Sanguinius,[14c] the Death Company fights terrible odds to claim one last honour for the Chapter.[1b] They are known to fight even more ferociously under the command of the Blood Angels' High Chaplain Astorath and the Chaplain Lemartes. While the High Chaplain fights besides them to ensure they meet a deserved glorious end, the Chaplain provides the Death Company with inspirational leadership and direction.[14d] Many of the Blood Angels' finest victories have come after the Death Company devastated the enemy forces.[1b] These include the battles they fought on Truatas, Antax, Hollonan, Armageddon,[14c] and Venerax.[14d] The Death Company's fearsome reputation has even spread to worlds that have not seen the Blood Angels in battle.[1b] However, it is not unheard of for entire strike forces to fall into the Black Rage. These terrible moments become marks of shame in the Blood Angels and Sanguinary Brotherhood's history, with names such Nycoth, the Scadden Atrocity, the War of Broken Wings, the Stenarr Massacre and the Battle of Lenikhe Reach bringing about mournful silence.[14c]
Soul Drinkers	The Soul Drinkers are a Successor Chapter of the Imperial Fists, formerly considered a Renegade Chapter.[1a] The original Soul Drinkers did not fit the standard template of Excommunicate Traitoris. Unlike most Renegade Space Marines, who have devoted themselves to the Chaos gods, the Soul Drinkers despised the Ruinous Powers as much if not more than they hate the Imperium that cast them out. Instead, they developed an ideology that stated that the Imperium has betrayed everything the Emperor has stood for; so they still fought the powers of chaos even though they disagree with what the Imperium now stands for. Some within the Chapter thought that the Imperium should be destroyed for the good of mankind. Since their refounding, the Soul Drinkers are considered an exemplar and heroic chapter lauded by the wider Imperium. Their Primaris members are ignorant of their Chapter's storied history.[9c]
Khazul	Khazul was an Inquisitor Lord who served in the Calixis Sector and was the master of Acolyte Presumptive Okonawk. When Okonawk neared the end of his training to become an Inquisitor, Khazul sent him and a cadre of Acolytes to the planet Acreage on a mission of dire importance. Khazul had not prepared his Acolytes for the number of enemies they would face there, as he wanted to test Okonawk to see if he had what it took to become an Inquisitor. When disaster struck the cadre, Okonawk persevered and succeeded in his mission, though at the cost of one hundred thousand citizens of Acreage, as well as the lives of his fellow Acolytes. When Okonawk returned to his master, Khazul greeted his Acolyte and told him he had passed his final test to become an Inquisitor. Learning the bitter truth that cost so many lives, Okonawk killed his erstwhile master.

Sisters of Battle	The Sisters of Battle are the armed wing and Orders Militant of the Adepta Sororitas. They serve as the standing army of the Ecclesiarchy. The Sisters of Battle, like the rest of the Adepta Sororitas, trace their history back to the troubled times of the Age of Apostasy. On a backwater world named San Leor an all-female cult dedicated to the worship of the Emperor, known as the "Daughters of the Emperor", were discovered by members of the Ecclesiarchy. Goge Vandire, the High Lord of the Administratum (and also Ecclesiarch of the Adeptus Ministorum), decided to visit San Leor and recruit the Daughters into his own private army. The Daughters were then renamed the "Brides of the Emperor" and became Lord Vandire's most loyal followers.[Needs Citation] As the events of the Age of Apostasy progressed the Adeptus Custodes, the praetorians of the Emperor himself, tried to approach the Brides and convince them of Vandire's treachery. In a last ditch effort to convince them, the Custodes took Alicia Dominica, leader of the Brides, and her chosen bodyguards deep into the Imperial Palace where they stood before the Emperor himself. What happened there remains unknown - Dominica and her companions were sworn to secrecy - but it became clear that the Brides, who then reverted to their original title of Daughters of the Emperor, had been awakened to the evil that Vandire represented. Marching into his audience chamber, Dominica paused only to condemn Vandire for his crimes before she beheaded the power-crazed dictator.[Needs Citation]
Ordo Machinum	The Ordo Machinum is an Ordo of the Inquisition. Overseeing the Adeptus Mechanicus, they are primarily concerned with the reintegration of recovered STCs into the Imperium's armies and the rare adaptation of alien technology into the established Mechanicum protocols. They ensure that laxness on the part of the Mechanicus does not permit a flawed design to enter Imperial service and more importantly prevent a greedy Magos from withholding vital designs for himself. Inquisitors of the Ordo Machinum often accompany Mechanicus archaeological teams to distant worlds, monitoring their recovery and analysis of STCs. Thus, they often work in concert with the Ordo Xenos — especially when the world in question has been under alien control or there is any suggestion of non-human origin for the technology the Mechanicus intends to recover.
Pranix	Pranix is an Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus. Pranix served the Inquisitor Montiyf as his Interrogator before being made a full Inquisitor. In 937.M41, Pranix led five Companies of the Space Wolves Chapter and units of the Cadian 301st and Tallarn 14th in an attempt to reclaim the nine Hollow Worlds from the vile clutches of Huron Blackheart.
Emora Brahms	"Our war is not one of battlefields and fleet engagements. It is waged by the dedicated agents of the Imperial Inquisition. It is fought in the cities and hives of the Imperium. In the backstreets and the forgotten sub levels. In hive-cites like Tertium. For if the Inquisition fails... if we fail... the Imperium falls with us." Shipmistress Emora Brahms a famous Rogue Trader of the powerful House Brahms. Her merchant voidship, the Mourningstar, is currently hosting the warband of Inquisitor Grendyl, acting as a base of operations in the war for Atoma Prime. Her fame is that of a seasoned Rogue Trader who has lead an interesting life and is also deep within Grendyl's counsel. However she would not be assisting Grendyl upon Atoma Prime if she had the option to leave.
Halleck	Halleck was an Inquisitor. In 456.M34 while pursuing heretics, he captured a mysterious insurgent known as the Angel of Truth. Discovering a horrifying secret from this mysterious figure, Halleck quickly made course for Terra but was beset by an unknown enemy during the journey. The only Imperial forces in the nearby vicinity during the incident was the Dark Angels Strike Cruiser Black Sword of Vengeance, who reported no sign of the Inquisitor, his vessel, or his prisoner.
The Angel	The Angel, also called the Sleeper and the Angel of Destruction, was an incredibly powerful living weapon, created on Terra by the Emperor himself.[1a] The Angel was "twice as tall as a man" (so 110-544 cm tall, using the shortest and tallest men ever recorded), with mighty wings on its back, and glowing with a halo of energy. It carried a massive flaming sword and left a trail of blue fire wherever it went. It was capable of laying waste to cities and armies in seconds. While physical attacks could slow it down or stun it, they could not truly harm it. It was completely immune to psychic attack, with any attempts to attack it resulting in the psyker suffering psychic backlash.[1b] The Angel was created to destroy the Emperor's enemies on Terra during its pacification. Chief among those was the Daemon Prince Pharaa'gueotla, an ancient daemon that had terrorized Terra since the dawn of Mankind. Pharaa'gueotla was finally cast out by the arrival of the Emperor himself, and fled from Terra soon after. The Emperor eventually cornered the daemon on the planet later known as Karis Cephalon. The Emperor, with the help of the mighty Angel, imprisoned the daemon in the very bedrock of the planet.[1c]
Ryt van der Ploop	Ryt van der Ploop is an Inquisitor who was in the walled city of Sarthport, on the Feudal World Yargan, when it was attacked and laid siege to by a native army. When the battle between the city and invading army later began to escalate, Ryt escaped the city and ran to reach the safety of a nearby forest. Unfortunately, the Inquisitor was spotted by Sarthport's defenders, who concluded that he must be a spy and a mounted force from the city was sent after him.
Sakarof	Sakarof was a Lord Inquisitor and master of the Ordo Hereticus based in the Helican Subsector.
Avoiding Becoming Your Own Grandfather And Other Paradoxes That Create Unnecessary Paperwork for the Administratum	Avoiding Becoming Your Own Grandfather And Other Paradoxes That Create Unnecessary Paperwork for the Administratum was an Imperial text written by Inquisitor August Helden IIV the Elder/Younger of the Ordo Chronos. It provides information on chronal dilation during Warp transit and the text is made available to Guardsmen within their regimental libraries.
Praetus Tharn	Praetus Tharn is a High Inquisitor who is taking part in the Antian Sector Conflict.
Hector Rex	Hector Rex is an Inquisitor Lord of the Ordo Malleus. Inquisitor Lord Rex was the Lord Proctor of the Scarus Conclave during the Siege of Vraks. A highly regarded hero in his time, he bore the title Auditorii Imperator, being one of the few souls who has been admitted into the presence of the Emperor. In his early years, because of his psychic abilities he was inducted into the Adeptus Astra Telepathica, where he was noted to have been much more able than his fellow students. Thus he was separated from them to undergo genetic augmentation, which accounts for his "massive physique"; following this he was handed over to the Inquisition for apprenticeship. It was during the Rebellion on Vraks that Rex uncovered a prophecy via the Emperor's Tarot that the planet could potentially fall and become a Daemon World. To avoid this outcome, Rex lobbied the entire Scarus conclave to obtain direct control over the war on Vraks and to induct the entire 88th Regiment of the Death Korps of Krieg into his own retinue. Although it was already within an Inquisitor Lord's mandate to do so, Lord Hector Rex was of a keen political mind, and did not want unwanted interference from his own enemies within the Inquisition, and would have preferred a united consensus against chaos. Hector Rex's proposal to the conclave was opposed by members of the Ordo Hereticus who saw the war as within their jurisdiction, having been incited by the Apostate Cardinal Xaphan and thus a Hereticus matter. Rex did narrowly obtain the majority consensus of the conclave and so he took to war himself alongside Captain Stern of the Grey Knights.
Alabel Santos	Alabel Santos is an Ordo Malleus Inquisitor who took part in the Pyrus Reach Conflict.
Alaric	Alaric is a Justicar of the Grey Knights. Alaric had been promoted to the rank of Justicar for two years before he was given control of any notable action. His first major command occurred when Inquisitor Ligeia requested assistance from the Grey Knights. She had discovered that The Prince of a Thousand Faces, also known as Ghargatuloth, was attempting to remanifest after a thousand year banishment. The daemon had first been banished by a force of Grey Knights led by Grand Master Mandulis on the Chaos held world of Khorion IX. This discovery was made after a strike force led by fellow Inquisitor Nyxos had apprehended a rogue Inquisitor named Gholic Ren-Sar Valinov. Valinov had in his possession a librum called Codicium Aeternum. This librum stated that the Emperor's Tarot predicted that the daemon would resurface somewhere on the Trail of Saint Evisser. Justicar Alaric had taken part in the raid that captured Ren-Sar Valinov, but was severly wounded; this allowed him to be present during this request, making him the obvious leader to assist Inquisitor Ligeia. Most of the chapter had already been committed to the struggle at the Eye of Terror and the Thirteenth Black Crusade forcing Grand Master Tencendur to only commit a small strike force to assist Inquisitor Ligea.[1a] Alaric commanded a strike force consisting of a Terminator squad led by Justicar Tancred and two Tactical squads led by justicars Genhain and Santoro. The Grey Knights chapter assigned him the Rubicon strike cruiser to traverse the Imperium.[1a] Upon reaching the trail, the Rubicon made directly for the planet Trepytos.[1b]
Inquisitor (film)	This article needs work on its citations.For help on citation see the citation guidelines. You can help Lexicanum by fixing it. Inquisitor, the movie, tells the story of Space Marine Captain Darius of the Dark Angels and his command squad who join Inquisitor Krieger in solving the mystery of a strange key. In 1996, for the 25th Anniversary Games Day, Games Workshop released (for limited sale) a short movie entitled Inquisitor. This movie was created using clips and footage that had been created as a pitch to Games Workshop for a movie deal. There were also trailers for two other films, Hive Infestation and Blood for the Blood God. Hive Infestation pitted Space Wolf Terminators against a Genestealer cult infestation of a Hive world. Blood for the Blood God portrayed Orks and Dark Angel Space Marines fighting along with an Inquisitor.
Will of Iron (Comic Series)	Will of Iron is the first volume of the 2016 Warhammer 40,000 comic series published by Titan Comics in April 2017, collecting of issues #0-4 from October 2016 - January 2017. After a thousand years, violent warp storms have receded from the Calaphrax Cluster, and an ancient battlefront in the war against Chaos has again been opened to the universe. Now, multiple forces risk complete immolation to attack the sector – drawn by the lure of ancient relics, lost knowledge, and powerful megaweapons, buried for aeons. Chief among those forces, the fearsome Dark Angels, emerald-armored Space Marines, shock-troopers of the Emperor's Imperium and indomitable defenders of humanity. But Chaos stirs in the warp, and the Dark Angels will not be alone for long!
Calth	Calth is part of Ultramar, the Realm of the Ultramarines. It is an airless world, and its surface is uninhabitable due to the deadly light of its blue sun. Despite this barren appearance, it is one of the most productive worlds in Ultramar; its population inhabits massive underground cavern-cities, and its orbital shipyards are renowned throughout the Imperium. The world of Calth had maintained contact with its neighbouring systems, including Macragge, allowing it to survive the chaos of the Age of Strife largely intact. Early in the rise of Roboute Guilliman, Calth became part of the new Ultramar empire. When Guilliman met the Emperor of Mankind, Calth became part of the greater Imperium.
Illuminati	The Illuminati are a secret society, existing beyond even the Emperor's knowledge, but manipulating and interpreting the Imperial Will to bring about their objectives.[Needs Citation] Every member is a part of the society by virtue of being "illuminated" through the experience of daemonic possession followed by salvation. Possessed by a daemon, they have done what seems impossible, exorcising the daemon from their body through their own sheer will.[Needs Citation] In most cases, a daemonhost does not survive possession - the victim is eventually driven insane, or the mind is driven out of the host body so that the daemon takes complete control of it. A daemon can exist indefinitely within a host, with the possessed host often continuing their mortal life. Sometimes a strong-willed host can put up some resistance and preserve their self within a tenuous corner of the possessed brain. The host mind survives as a mere helpless witness as the daemon uses the mortal body to wreak its terrible acts. In a few instances, however, an individual has managed to cast the daemon from their body.[Needs Citation]
Alain Von Baigg	Alain Von Baigg was a Junior Interrogator for Inquisitor Eisenhorn, around the time of the Inquisitor's final confrontation with the Xenophile Heretic Beldame Sadia. Baigg had originally been accepted into Eisenhorn's retinue, with the hopes that he would become inspired while serving alongside his fellow Interrogator Ravenor. This did not happen though and instead Baigg attempted to further his own career by spying on Eisenhorn, for his seniors in the Ordos Helican. The information Baigg later provided about Eisenhorn's use of the Malus Codicium, eventually led to the Inquisitor's own persecution as a Heretic, by the Inquisition.
Zarath (Inquisitor)	Zarath is an Inquisitor active in the Askellon Sector.
Thraxx	Thraxx was an Inquisitor. He was sent to Varsavia, homeword of the Silver Skulls, to further investigate the chapter's gene-seed after a report was filed with the Inquisition by the Lord of the Household. He was met by Apothecary Malus, who gave him a tour of their Apothecarion. At this time he wore a red cape.
Mardaine	Mardaine was an Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus. At one point Mardaine was travelling aboard a Black Ship containing psykers bound for Terra. One of the psykers, a young girl named Adorjin, had been possessed by the daemon Nekaybraianon, who used her body to commit unspeakable deeds on the other passengers. Mardaine, however, was able to help Adorjin, and she was able to cast the daemon from her body. Adorjin would go on to become Mardaine's acolyte, and eventually she was made an Inquisitor in her own right.
Ozymandias Ruthven	Ozymandias Ruthven was an Inquisitor Lord of the Ordo Hereticus, who lead the Sinophian Prosecution and survived the first confirmed encounter with a fully transformed user of a Halo Device. Some hundred years before the Angevin Crusade on the then frontier world of Sinophia Magna, Inquisitor Lord Ruthven was sent to destroy the heretic scion of a great and wealthy mercantile house of Sinophia. To Ruthven's surprise, it became clear during this prosecution that the heretic was not, as first suspected, a daemon-worshiper, warped mutant, or witch. The Scion, whose name has been stricken from all records, was said to possess a body that was the hideous fusion of polluted human flesh and xenological artefact; which granted him unnatural powers and was said to make him, unable to be killed. Ruthven proved otherwise however, as after a hard fought battle the Inquisitor Lord had the defeated Scion bounded and then hurled into the heart of Sinophia's sun, destroying him completely. Afterwards it was determined that the crimes and secret atrocities committed by the Scion were so grievous as to merit the execution of not only his house and vassals, but all of his close associates as well.
Taarn	Aliens must be eradicated from our worlds, purged from the galaxy, destroyed wherever they appear. However, on occasion, they can be a useful tool…—Inquisitor Taarn Taarn is a Radical Ordo Xenos Inquisitor.[1a]
Scallen	Scallen was an Ordo Hereticus Inquisitor, active in early M41. In 085.M41, he formed Strike Force Purgation after uncovering the existence of the infamous Cult Epicurean on the Hive World Farglum. Though the Strike Force was initially formed of Scallen's own household troops, he would come to call upon elements of the Imperial Guard, Space Marines and Adepta Sororitas to combat the Cult, which had spread throughout the Farglum System. The Cult Epicurean's final end came, when Scallen led a final successful assault against the Cult within the depths of Farglum's Hive Tumulus.
Malum Pyron	Malum Pyron is an Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos, whose chequered past, of being missing for months on end and insubordination, has caused his peers to suspect him of Radicalism. Not helping Pyron's cause, are the constant rumours that he has embraced both using Xenos weapons and even employing Xenos as agents. Regardless of what his detractors believe, the countless worlds he has saved from Xenos cannot be contested; neither can the great massacre he was responsible for on Pharaday. It was because of these successes that when the Forge World Glomus fell to an Ork Waaagh!, he was chosen by his Ordo along with Inquisitor Ferax Lomar to determine what Imperium world, the Orks would target next. However, even as the Imperial strike force they accompanied landed upon Glomus to liberate the Forge World, Pyron and Lomar's differing stances caused a conflict between them. The suspected Radical refused to work with the Puritan Lomar, who felt the same, and with the promise of promotion, for the one who discovered what world the Orks would target next, the Inquisitors also refused to accept one another's help. Even now as the Imperial strike force struggles to both liberate the world and prevent the Waaagh! from departing, so the Inquisitor's can achieve their goal, Pyron and Lomar are now both behind the Orks' battle lines with their retinues; each working separately to determine where the Waaagh! will strike next.
Pavlac	Pavlac is a Witch Hunter and adversary of Radical Inquisitor Czevak.[1a] After Radical Inquisitor Bronislaw Czevak left the Black Library for the first time, during the opening days of the 13th Black Crusade, Pavlac began to raze worlds that would host Czevak's conclaves, and executed Inquisitors who would meet him and hear his words.[1a][1b] Pavlac's charge was that they were all pawns of the Xenos or the Ruinous Powers.[1a] The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Restrepo	Restrepo is a Radical Inquisitor who bound a Daemon within the Plasma Gun now known as Daemonfury.
Space Marine Company	A Space Marine Company is the broadest organizational unit in a Space Marine Chapter. Each standard Codex Chapter consists of ten Companies. Each of these Companies is notionally one hundred Marines strong. The 1st Company is made up of the veterans of the Chapter. These include Veteran Squads, Terminator Squads and Terminator Assault Squads. Support for the First Company is Land Raiders and Dreadnoughts.
Arfon Hoiditma	Arfon Hoiditma is an Inquisitor, who serves as the Inquisition's representative in Indomitus Crusade Fleet Primus' Council Exterra.
Angevin Crusade	The Angevin Crusade was a Crusade begun in 322.M39 focused around the Calixis Sector. The Crusade began officially when the High Lords of Terra authorized Lord Militant Golgenna Angevin to liberate the areas around the Calyx Expanse. His forces, drawn from Segmentum Solar, numbered over 17 million troops divided into four battle groups and a strategic reserve plus Space Marines from the Black Templars, Charnel Guard, Howling Griffons, Sons of Medusa, and Tigers Argent Chapters. Titan Legions from the Legio Venator and Legio Magna also contributed to the Crusade's cause. The forces were further swelled by Frateris Militia stirred into a frenzy by the Ecclesiarchy. The Crusade's first strike was conducted in a two-pronged thrust into the heart of the Calyx Expanse, Malfi and Solomon by the end of 341.M39. The two worlds fell quickly, giving the Crusade a beachhead. Three minor Xenos empires were defeated from these anchors. In light of its success, the High Lords authorized further reinforcements. Seizing the moment, the Crusade launched a gigantic sweeping offensive throughout the years of 341-545.M39 in an event known as the Reaping of the Emperor's Wrath. Known worlds to fall in the Reaping are Iocanthos, whose warlord regime fell to General Drusus in a single week. Exterminatus was enacted on the world of Amun'an Morrus, where the once-human population had since become mutated into hideous machines. With the first and second great phases of the Crusade completed, by 353.M39 Angevin's forces consolidated their holdings, over two hundred worlds. Several Imperial Guard regiments that had shown valor in the preceding fighting were given the right to settle newly acquired worlds, such as the Brontine Centurions.
Kal Jerico (Graphic Novel Series)	Kal Jerico is the main character of a number of comic strips, novels and short stories, mostly set in the Underhives of Necromunda. Kal Jerico starred in a total of 30 comic strips, serialised in Warhammer Monthly from the first issue in 1998 to the last in 2004. All strips in the format Title (Issue of Warhammer Monthly, artist)
Brutius Parthon	Brutius Parthon is a Radical Inquisitor Lord, of the Ordo Xenos and long time friend of Inquisitor Lord Agustius.[1a] Parthon had been tracking a series of Tyranid attacks in a sector of space, when he realized it was a splinter of Hive Fleet Kraken, chasing the Craftworld Iyanden; still weakened from the Battle for Iyanden. Contacting the Eldar, he forced an agreement where in return for Eldar technology, Parthon would agree not to tell the Imperial Navy, where the Craftworld was hiding. With the Eldar technology, as well as Tyranid corpses, the Inquisitor Lord hoped to create a weapon capable of destroying the Tyranid threat once and for all. Parthon requisitioned, an abandoned Adeptus Mechanicus base on the sparsely populated planet Herodian IV and set up a hidden weapons research laboratory, headed by the Xenos Inquisitor Grendal. In order to make sure he could provide additional resources unhindered from prying eyes, he had his ship the battleship, Veiled Salvation stationed nearby next to the Herodian warp gate.[1a] This continued for years, until experiments with the weapon, that would be known as the Grendal-machine, brought unforeseen consequences. A splinter fleet was drawn to Herodian IV by the usage of the Grendal-machine and began invading the planet. The Mantis Warriors heard the distress call, sent by the population and sent aid fighting the Tyranids on the surface and orbit. Though initially having some success, they were eventually overrun and evacuated from the planet[1b]. During this time, Parthon learned of the attack and closed the Herodian warp gate, before requesting a Imperial Navy taskforce to fight the Tyranids. It would just so happen that a Deathwatch Kill Team led by Quirion Octavius, landed on his ship unable to proceed through the close warp gate. They were normally tasked to his old friend Xenos Inquisitor Lord Agustius, but Parthon saw a chance to save the Grendal-machine from the doomed planet. He lied to the Kill Team and sent them to Herodian IV, on the pretense of killing a Hive Tyrant to disrupt the Tyranid forces. Leading them would be his protegee Inquisitor Kalypsia, who knew the real reason Parthon wanted them on the planet.[1c]
Vraks	The only inhabited world of the Vraks system, Vraks Prime was an armoury world of the Imperium, used as a vast storage facility for supplies and equipment.[1a] Vraks's society was organised with the same hierarchy as the Administratum on Terra. The majority of its population were either bureaucratic adepts or labourers. A transient population of up to five million pilgrims was on Vraks Prime at any time visiting the shrine to St. Leonis.[1a] The Vraks system was first discovered in the Imperium's expansion after the Age of Strife. The Van Meer rogue trader household explored the world and the Van Meersland Wastes are named in their honour. The world was established as an armoury world for exploration and other operations around the Eye of Terror lying to the southeast of the system. The Departmento Munitorum built a fortress and starport to protect the world's stockpiles of arms and armour.[1a]
Ghesmei Kysnaros	Ghesmei Kysnaros was a Lord Inquisitor at the time of the First War for Armageddon.[1a] Despite his involvement with Armageddon, he was not a member of the Ordo Malleus, and remained unaligned until his death.[1e] Despite the Wolves' insistence that that the defenders of Armageddon be spared for their bravery, Puritan voices held majority in the Inquisition, and it was decided that the planet's populace would would be expunged and the world resettled to erase any Chaotic taint and maintain silence regarding such a powerful Chaos entity, let alone the rumors that he was one of the Emperor's lost sons. Kysnaros was one of the prime overseers for the purge of the surviving civilian and Imperial Guard population. Kysnaros commandeered the Imperial Navy vessel Corel's Hope for use in the operation. Lord Kysnaros believed that with enough impetus, he could convince the Space Wolves to agree to the Inquisition's cold reasoning without having to censure or destroy the chapter entirely. Given his ardent support of the purge and his initially soft attitude with the insubordinate Space Wolves, juxtaposed with his harsh methods in dealing with them in the crisis had served only to escalate the situation.[1a] During the next few months, the Space Wolves would use defensive tactics to protect the courageous surviving Imperial Guard elements that served on Armageddon and worked to disseminate them to relative safety across the Imperium in defiance of the Inquisition. Over the next several months, the Grey Knights would be the spearhead that would lead to entire Imperial populations across nearby space being destroyed to maintain silence of Armageddon, despite the incredibly bloody price that silence would demand. The Inquisition's cold war with the Space Wolves came to a head when the Inquisitorial fleet opened fire upon Space Wolves ships during an armistice of negotiation. Logan Grimnar, having already boarded Corel's Hope for negotiations, exchanged some heated words with Kysnaros and struck down Grey Knights Grand Master Joros directly in front of the Inquisitor Lord in a bout of righteous fury. Kysnaros, believing he could still convince the Space Wolves of the necessity of his actions, allowed the Space Wolves to escape. Outraged, the Wolves would instead shift to a more aggressive stance, and the civil war between the Inquision and Space Wolves began in earnest.[1b]

Newmarrk	Newmarrk is an Inquisitor who has fallen to Heresy. He commands the Inquisitorial Cruiser Hymn of Ghalmek and took part in the Pyrus Reach Conflict.
Kryptman Gambit	The Octarius War is a major conflict being waged between the Tyranid Hive Fleet Leviathan and the powerful Ork Empire of Octarius as well as tangential players such as the Imperium and Forces of Chaos. By the end of the 41st Millennium, the Imperium was beset by the third and mightiest Tyranid Hive Fleet, Leviathan. As the swarm rampaged throughout the southern plain of the galaxy, Inquisitor Kryptman desperately looked for an answer to the Tyranid threat. Looking to the Ork Empire of Octarius, Kryptman devised a plan to utilize mankind's old foe against the invading Tyranids and, in the best case scenario, kill two birds with one stone. Kryptman led several specially equipped Deathwatch teams into the caverns of Carpathia to attempt to capture a brood of live Genestealers in a stasis field. The mission was successful, although Kryptman's force suffered heavy casualties. He then planted the brood on board the Perdition's Flame, a Space Hulk that emerged from the Warp in the path of Leviathan. As the Genestealers awoke, he destroyed the moon of Gheist in order to divert the hulk's trajectory directly towards the Octarius Empire.
Adamara Rassilo	Adamara Rassilo was a Radical Lord Inquisitor of the Ordo Hereticus. A senior member of the Inquisition on Terra, Rassilo was greatly respected and powerful. However, upon learning of the failings of the Golden Throne she became part of a scheme to recruit help from the Dark Eldar to repair the vital construct and save the life of the Emperor. She smuggled a Dark Eldar Haemonculus onto Terra, but it promptly went rogue and began conduct its own ritual killings. Rassilo, the Custodian Ephoroi agent Navradaran, and the Inquisitor Erasmus Crowl all began to hunt the creature underneath the Imperial Palace. Battle was joined between Rassilo and her followers and the Custodes and Crowl's Retinue and ultimately the Haemonculus was slain and Rassilo's plan foiled. She attempted to explain her actions to Crowl, but he nonetheless condemned her as an enemy. Rassilo attempted to level her weapon at Crowl, but he was faster and shot her in the head. All those she had taken into the catacombs with her were later found by the Custodes and disposed of.
Iorgu	Iorgu is a Civilised World of the Imperium, located in the Reef Stars.
Halan Jentz	Halan Jentz (in some sources, Halen Jentz[2a]) was an Ordo Hereticus Inquisitor who declared the entire population of the Abonian Sub-Sector diabolos inculcatus and gathered together a Crusade army to bring them to account for their crimes. The Crusade lasted for a decade before Halan finally declared that they had completed their task. Halan Jentz led this Genocide from onboard an Ordo Hereticus Rhino, which was blessed by having the words of the Sacramento Diablos engraved on its hull. Onto the rear of the vehicle Jentz' scribe illuminated a copy of his Inquisitorial Mandate for proper glory.[2b] In this campaign Jentz was supported by the Adepta Sororitas of the Order of the Blue Robe (which fielded at least one Exorcist as part of its army[2a]), and the Order of the Black Sepulchre.
Inquisitor Conspiracies 1 - Cirian Legacy	Inquisitor: Conspiracies - The Cirian Legacy is the first book in the Inquisitor: Conspiracies series - a supplement to the narrative skirmish game Inquisitor based on Games Workshop's Warhammer 40,000 Universe. The Ocean Planet of Cirian V holds many secrets that are jealously guarded by the Tech-Priests of the Adeptus Mechanicus. The presence of the Inquisition is unwelcome and treated with suspicion. Can the recently arrived Inquisitors unravel the mysteries of the Cirian Legacy?[1c]
Vullwrath	Vullwrath is a Radical Ordo Malleus Inquisitor of the Askellon Sector, who wields a Daemon Weapon. He claims no one can judge for this, as only a weak person would listen to the weapon's whispered promises and lie. Vullwrath, however, claims his strong will helps him remain pure and he has used the weapon's power, to rid Askellon of countless Heretics and Daemons.
Laeman	Laeman is an Ordo Hereticus Inquisitor who is allies with his fellow Inquisitor, Vasult. The two have currently combined their forces together. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here. Laeman and Vasult were created by the Games Workshop employee Chris Bilewicz and they were featured in Warhammer: Visions 13.
Reiker	Reiker was an Inquisitor who took part in the Triumph of Thracian, where there appeared to be some ill feelings between him and Inquisitor Eisenhorn[1a]. Later after Inquisitor Lord Defay disappeared, following his victory over a Daemon on Nicodemus[1b], Reiker was charged by the Inquisition with finding him. Defay's former Acolyte, and now Interrogator, Gravier was assigned to aid Reiker and the two soon tracked the missing Inquisitor Lord to the world Sepulchris. There they confronted Defay, as the Inquisitor Lord was trying to open a Warp portal on the world, but disaster struck when Gravier's loyalty to his former master, led him to turn upon Reiker. In the battle that followed between them, Reiker was overwhelmed and killed, but it was revealed that Defay had fallen to Heresy and he killed Gravier in turn, before opening the Warp portal.[1c]
Pietrov Mensk	Pietrov Mensk is an Ordo Aegis Inquisitor, who is among the Inquisition's forces combating Abaddon the Despoiler's efforts to collapse the Sanctus Wall. During the course of doing so, Mensk rooted out and purged a growing Mutant colony of thousands on the world Dark Pit, in the Coryxx System.
Garm	Garm is an Industrial World of the Imperium, long associated with the Space Wolves chapter. Located on the direct warp route between Fenris and the Eye of Terror, Garm was named after a Wolf Lord from the earliest days of the Chapter, who had given his life defending the Space Wolves' Primarch, Leman Russ, from an attack by Magnus the Red of the Thousand Sons Chaos Space Marines. In recognition of this act of sacrifice, Leman Russ raised a cairn to Garm upon the spot of his death, laying his spear — a weapon which had wounded Magnus - atop the memorial and reputedly entrusting it to Garm's spirit.[1a] This memorial grew over time into an important Imperial Shrine, one zealously maintained and guarded by the inhabitants of the world, as well as watched over by the Space Wolves themselves. Also a place of significance to the Thousand Sons, Garm often found itself the site of battles between warriors from the two ancient foes.[1a] Because of these factors (and Garm's galactic location), the Space Wolves built a small outpost upon the world, one designed to act as a supply and repair base for the Chapter as well as to provide a small Astartes guard for the Shrine of Garm's Skull.[1b]
Verinath	Verinath was an Inquisitor Lord, who was the oldest known Revivificator when he died at the age of 763.
Nikhola Kalus	Nikhola Kalus is an Ordo Xenos Inquisitor, who has reservations about the Tyrannic War Veterans formation created by the Ultramarines Chapter. He hopes they possess the requisite qualities, to properly handle the weapon the Chapter has unleashed. The Inquisitor has vowed that he and the Ordo Xenos will be watching the Ultramarines closely, to make sure that they do.
Layran	Layran was an Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos who vanished, along with his retinue, while investigating a xenos conspiracy connected to the Beast House organization, on the planet Fenksworld. Their loss led the Ordo Xenos of the Calixis Sector to place the organization under scrutiny and led to an ongoing covert investigation of the Beast House's mysterious master, Solkarn Senk.
Katarinya Greyfax	Katarinya Greyfax (rosette number 7134/S3[13a]) is a Radical (though she was initially a Puritan) Inquisitor of the Ordo Hereticus. Greyfax was imprisoned within a Tesseract Vault by the Necron Overlord Trazyn the Infinite for centuries until she was released, along with his other prisoners, to aid the Imperium's forces on Cadia during the 13th Black Crusade. Despite being a powerful Psyker herself, when Greyfax emerged she was shocked at the sight of Imperial psykers using their powers without sanction and to see the Space Wolves Chapter's Wulfen running rampant on the battlefield. What left her utterly appalled, though, was seeing how the Imperial defenders of Cadia worshiped the so-called Living Saint, Celestine, as it was nothing short of idolatry in Greyfax's mind. These sights, however, have not shaken her unwavering faith in the Emperor and Greyfax is committed to aiding the Imperium in defending Cadia. Greyfax ultimately worked alongside these psychic abominations and mutants in battling Abaddon personally. Ultimately, however, Cadia fell and Greyfax fled to the outer system with several of her allies, such as Saint Celestine and Belisarius Cawl. Hounded by the Black Legion, they were guided into the Webway on Kalisus by Eldrad Ulthran.
Prophaniti	Prophaniti was a Daemon trapped into into a human host by Inquisitor Quixos. Quixos was never able to determine the demon's true name, resulting in the name he gave it (something of a play on the word "profanity", which is ironically appropriate). Along with Cherubael, Prophaniti served as part of Quixos' "entourage". In 339.M41, Inquisitor Gregor Eisenhorn and Inquisitor-General Neve, fresh on the trail of Quixos, stumbled upon Prophaniti and the Sons of Bael while they were measuring the dimensions one of the Pylons of Cadia at Kasr Gesh. A fight broke out almost immediately, but the Sons of Bael were no match for Neve's Kasrkin bodyguards, and were promptly wiped out almost to the last. Prophaniti himself proved to be more of a challenge, however, and would have killed them all if not for the untouchable quality of Alizebeth Bequin. Such as it was, the daemonhost managed to melt Eisenhorn's power sword, also commenting on the weapon's weakness despite the addition of pentagrammic wards, and briefly knocked Neve unconscious. In the end, it was the valiant sacrifice of Neve's three Kasrkin that bought Eisenhorn enough time to call in the firepower of his gun-cutter and vaporised Prophaniti's host body. Prophaniti, however, then proceeded to possess the body of Eisenhorn's associate Husmaan and took off just as Inquisitor Osma arrived on the scene to arrest Eisenhorn on charges of heresy.[1a]
Durandal Grohe	Durandal Grohe is an infamous and wealthy Human Rogue Trader. Amassing several continent-sized estates on various worlds of the Imperium, his fleet eventually grew to seven transports as well as the Fast Clipper Durandal's Bliss. After coming across a large trove of Xenos artefacts which he gave to the Adeptus Mechanicus for a tidy sum, he aroused the suspicion of the Inquisition but was vouched for by Magos Brunt Carnivrir. After the discovery of the T'au, Grohe made multiple voyages across the Damocles Gulf and engaged in trade with the aliens despite a ban by Imperial authorities. This activity continued even after the Damocles Gulf Crusade. Nonetheless, Grohe was valued as a source of information on the T'au by certain Imperial officials. His activity eventually led him into conflict with Inquisitor Ibrahim Matthias, who was certain Grohe was giving the T'au technology used to upgrade their starships. Grohe disappeared soon after, but several of his fleet craft were discovered and destroyed by the Imperial Navy. Five years later, he appeared at the head of a T'au fleet of thirty ships, guiding them beyond the Farsight Enclaves. The Inquisition and a small Imperial Navy detachment is still pursuing the fleet, but due to the Tyranid threat on the Eastern Fringe only limited resources have been committed and Grohe and his allies continue to evade detection. The purpose of their journey remains unknown.
Scarn	Inquisitor Scarn is a centuries-old, shadowy, and extremely manipulative member of the Inquisition. His methods have been labeled eccentric or downright heretical by fellow Inquisitors. Throughout his career, he has often disappeared and was presumed dead, only to reappear several years later. Scarn rarely fights, and will make sure any direct confrontation is on his own terms. In the past, whenever Scarn was forced into a direct confrontation, something miraculous would always happen: it was a puppet servitor, a holographic representation, or a doppelganger even. Scarn's last sighting was at an Inquisitorial gathering, and has not been seen since. However, Scarn has spent much of his recent years in the Scarla Nyses sub-sector, particularly on Cirian V. He was said to have spent the better part of the last six decades developing his "ultimate plan", a scheme that will solve all the problems the Imperium faces.
Imperial Armour Volume Four - The Anphelion Project	Imperial Armour Volume Four - The Anphelion Project is a Codex for the Games Workshop Table Top game Warhammer 40,000. It is part of the The Imperial Armour serie of books. This volume focuses on the Tyranids and the Ordo Xenos, and covers the events of the Anphelion Project.[1b]
Seroglazni	Seroglazni is an Inquisitor Lord of the Ordo Hereticus, who attended the annual purge of potential heretics on the planet Kaurava I. One thousand and seven hundred heretics were burned at the stake and Seroglazni promised to return to the planet at a later date, to ensure the proper purging of the population of possible heretics was being attended to.
Lorquai	Lorquai was an Inquisitor active in late M41. Sister Superior Meritia sent Inquisitor Lorquai a copy of her translation of the Eldar prophecy the Ishandruir in 724.M41.
Malich (Inquisitor)	Malich is an Ordo Hereticus Inquisitor and was among the few to be granted an Inferno Pistol wrought by the Master Artificer Ernst Heckler in M38.
Kas-Sonda	Kas-Sonda is an Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos who was charged with investigating the Genestealer Cults after the Ordo learned how widespread throughout the Imperium they were. When the Inquisitor's investigation was complete, the Ordo Xenos learned that many of the weapons used by the Cults have either been bought on the black-market or stolen from Planetary Defence Forces, Adeptus Arbites precincts, or even Astra Militarum training grounds and fortresses.
Kravin	Inquisitor Kravin of the Ordo Malleus was the leading scholar in the Alpha Legion's history and current activities.[1a] Recently his studies have been cast into doubt and his current whereabouts are unknown.[1d] Kravin is responsible of much of the knowledge possessed about the secretive Alpha Legion. His findings were put to question after his speech towards the Ikrilla Conclave, when he was accused by Inquisitor Girreaux of consorting with traitors and of plotting to organize Chaos uprisings within the Imperium. He has since disappeared without answering these accusations, which renders all information he provided about the Legion suspicious to say the least. In fact, much of it is now believed to be disinformation created by the Alpha Legion itself.[1d] Alpharius, the Alpha Legion's primarch, has been an enigma to the Imperium until recently. Kravin claimed to have found an ancient journal that describes the first contact between Horus and Alpharius towards the end of the Great Crusade and the time both Primarchs spent together. Kravin estimated the validity of said journal at 62.6%.[1a]
Felroth Gelt	Felroth Gelt was a very experienced member of the Ordo Malleus who was very knowledgeable about the Calixis Sector at large.[1a] Gelt began his career as a Monodominant Puritan, but over the centuries he turned more and more often to the lure of the Radical. He joined the Xanthite faction in 809.M41 and vanished from official records.[1a] Gelt had an intensive journal that contained all his notes about everything he encountered in the Calixis Sector ranging from beasts, aliens, and heretics.[1b] He also had a solid retinue of acolytes under him to carry his commands and expand the investigations in the sector.[1c][1d][1e]

But when he discovers a shocking secret, Herrold finds himself a prisoner of Sanguinius’s most dangerous sons, and his audience with the Master of the Flesh Tearers proves more perilous than he could have ever imagined.
Abandoned Hope (Planet)	Abandoned Hope is an Imperial world that was warded by the Inquisition after a Daemonic incursion. Access to the world is now denied and knowledge of its existence is forbidden to all.
Abramis VII	Abramis VII is an Imperium world.
Absolom Reach	Absolom Reach was once a Hive World of the Imperium of Man, before a daemonic incursion turned it into a Daemon World.

Segmentum Obscurus	The Segmentum Obscurus is one of the five Segmentums, divisions of the Galaxy, of the Imperium. It is located to the north of Holy Terra, and its Segmentum Fortress is located at Cypra Mundi. One of its most notable features is the Eye of Terror, home of the Chaos Space Marines. Following the conclusion of the Thirteenth Black Crusade and the resurrection of Roboute Guilliman, much of Segmentum Obscurus has become stranded within Imperium Nihilus.
Research Station	Imperial worlds classified as ρ-class are often times research stations, but are not always. They can also be Repository Worlds. Some aren't worlds either, instead being based in orbit around planets or on asteroids. These research stations might be located on secluded Dead Worlds or Death Worlds. Types of research stations include actual laboratories, as well as surveillance posts for defensive purposes. Populations range from 100 to 500,000, and tithes are typically Aptus Non. In bureaucratic matters classifications of research stations and Fortress Worlds overlap.
Aggreon	Aggreon was the site of a battle involving the Dark Angels Master Belial during his command of the Chapter's Third Company.
Adacore	Adacore is a Mining World. The human workers of hive cities covet Adacore rebreathers, developed on the world to efficiently filter particulates like ore dust. This feature has made it much sought-after among the many refinery workers in manufactories across the wider Imperium. In 984.M41, Venerable Dreadnought Bannus led a strike force of twenty Iron Hands Dreadnoughts to scour the planet after excavations awoke the Necron forces of Overlord Kepakh of the Nihilakh Dynasty.
Acheron IV	Acheron IV is an Imperial Hive World, that has nearly been conquered by the Orks of Waaagh! Uggrot. It is also the site of a Shrine dedicated to Saint Helena and in response to the Ork invasion, Canoness Verena Armenii of the Argent Shroud led a battlehost to save the Saint's relics. When they arrived, the Shrine had been destroyed, though Verena hoped to find the relics amongst its ruins. While the battlehost succeeded in their goal, they paid a high price to do so, as the Canoness and a large number of their Sisters were killed by the Orks.
Adacore Extermination	The Adacore Extermination took place in 984.M41. Venerable Dreadnought Bannus led a strike force of twenty Iron Hands Dreadnoughts to scoure the Mining World of Adacore after excavations awaken the Necron forces of Overlord Kepakh of the Nihilakh Dynasty.
Acralem	The planet Acralem is infamous for being the location of a daemonic incursion led by M'kar the Reborn in 799.M41, who had ambitions of destroying not only Acralem but the entire Vidar Sector. However, a force of Grey Knights from the Third Brotherhood, with aid from nine Imperial Guard Regiments and the Flesh Tearers and Astral Knights Chapters, fell upon the planet and laid about to bloody slaughter. If not for the Grey Knights, Acralem would have been doomed, as the tide was only turned once the Grey Knights struck at M'kar's warp-fortress where a then-Battle-Brother by the name of Kaldor Draigo struck the deathblow to the daemon lord himself, casting the incursion back to the warp. However, M'kar placed a curse on Draigo before being sucked from the material plane. Victory is yours this day mortal, but know that if ever you set foot upon this world again, you and all who follow you shall walk with damnation for ten millennia.-M'kar the Reborn to Knight Draigo
Adun	Adun is a world of unknown affiliation.[3a] The planet was a site of battle between the Imperium and another unknown faction.

Civilised World	A γ-class or civilised world is a classification of a world's type in the Imperium. Of all the types of settlement in the Imperium, civilised worlds are the most common (although the term "civilised" here refers to their urban landscapes rather than to any pretence of social decorum.) On these self-sufficient worlds, the main population centres tend to be large cities or other urban environments that are supported by the planet's own agricultural production. The state of development both technologically and socially varies, but is most commonly around the current Imperial norm. Most adjuncts of the Imperial state will normally have a presence on the planet. By the classification guidelines, a civilised world has a population from 15,000,000 to 10,000,000,000 and pays tithes between Solutio Extremis and Exactis Tertius.
Shrine World	Shrine Worlds (or Shrineworlds and Cathedral Worlds) are Imperial worlds devoted to a Saint of the Imperium and are often named in their honour. These worlds are ruled directly by the Adeptus Ministorum and attract huge amounts of pilgrims from all over the Imperium. There are also the dark mirrors to these places of Imperial devotion - fallen worlds where the inhabitants offer up ceaseless prayer to the Dark Gods. These places of obscene sacrifices and bloody rites are not suffered continued existence for long. Often Shrine Worlds are places of eternal rest for holy men and women of the Imperium and the entire surface of these sacred planets are given over to the hallowed crypts of sainted and great monolithic cathedra. Most shrine worlds usually fall into another category - for example, Hagia is an agri world while Herodor is a Hive World. They have a strong relationship with the saint in question, such as being the world of his or her birth or martyrdom.[Needs Citation] This article needs work on its citations.For help on citation see the citation guidelines. You can help Lexicanum by fixing it.
Aipolodon IV	Aipolodon IV is an Imperial Agri World, that has industrial abattoir cities. Aipolodon IV was created by the Games Workshop employee Andy Clark and appeared in White Dwarf 481.
Fortress World	With the Imperium in a constant state of war, some worlds are designated as Fortress worlds to act as bastions against the enemies of the God-Emperor. You are part of that defence, keeping the evil outside the gates from breaking through. This has made you part of the glory of the Imperium's mighty forces of war. A Fortress World is a category of Imperial planet where the entire populace is immersed in warfare. They are created as bastions against some threat. The most well known fortress world was Cadia, which was guarding the Cadian Gate at the entrance to the Eye of Terror.[Needs Citation] In bureaucratic matters classifications of Research Stations and fortress worlds overlap, both being ρ-class.[2a] Since the establishment of the Indomitus Crusade, many Fortress Worlds are being converted into Hub-Fortresses to support the war effort.
Alactra	Alactra is a Hive World in the Malfian Sub-sector of the Calixis Sector.
Al-Zahara	Al-Zahara is an Imperial world.
War World	War worlds are classed as war zones, in the Imperium there are a great many worlds that can be classed as war zones. The Imperium is constantly at war and in those wars whole planets can burn. Massive campaigns can envelop dozens of systems and hundreds of worlds, many of which are utterly devastated by orbital bombardments and artillery in planet-spanning battles that last decades. Long-term war zones are hellish places where death comes quickly. The Imperium can field truly immense armies of millions of men, grinding their way across a devastated planet and reducing cities to rubble. Mercenaries flock to such places, hoping to leave soon after with their ships loaded with pay. Deserters and escaped prisoners form bands of pirates, preying on any ships unable to defend themselves or roam the war-torn planets in feral packs stealing and killing. The Administratum sends colonists from overcrowded worlds to populate war-torn worlds after the fighting has ended but the wheels of the Imperium grind slowly and a world can lie devastated for centuries before any effort is made to resettle it. These places can be some of the most ghastly in the Imperium, with ravaged environments, cracked planetary crusts, burnt-out cities and plains covered in the bones of the fallen.
Prophets of War	The Prophets of War were a Dark Eldar coalition formed by Archon Viscount Rex to plunder the Corvus Sub-Sector during the Crusade of Fire. Wielding enough power and wealth in Commorragh to recruit multiple Kabals, Wych Cults, the powerful Duke Sliscus, and even Necron allies through the promise of recovering lost artifacts, The Prophets of War went on to counter Imperial and Chaos forces on Alfrost and Voidspan Point.

The planet is described as being of sulphurous waste and tainted pink skies. It is located at the edge of the Oqueth Sector.
Actium (Planet)	Actium is a Jungle World of the Galaxy. The Soul Drinkers once fought on the planet.
Alfrost	Alfrost is a planet of the Corvus Sub-sector. A frozen harsh planet that was never effectively held by the Imperium despite their best colonization efforts to harvest its resources, the planet's scattered surviving communities remained largely unaffected by the coming of the Crow's Eye. For the thousand years the Corvus Sub-sector was isolated from Imperial rule, the lone Imperial Guard Regiment stationed on the planet continued to loyally garrison the world, as their fathers and grandfathers had before them. During the Crusade of Fire, Alfrost was the site of heavy fighting between the Space Wolves and Dark Eldar of the Prophets of War.
Agri World	An Agri-World (Agricultural World or Farming Planet) or α-class (alpha class) is a world classification defined as being devoted to food production. The majority of its surface is given over to producing food for other worlds reliant on such imports - the food itself forms part of the planet's required tithe. Governors of such planets are required by the Adeptus Terra to protect the harvest and meet the quotas placed on them. Often inter-commander rivalry leads to attempts to destroy or steal crops and livestock and then blaming them on pirates or raids. Worlds with 850 parts per 1000 of the planet's surface covered with crop cultivation, hydroponics, animal fodder or animal husbandry are classed as Agri-Worlds. The population usually ranges from between 15,000 to 1,000,000 - which is widely spread across the planet. The tithe grade of such worlds range from Exactis Prima to Exactis Particular. Despite Imperial propaganda, Agri-Worlds are often harsh polluted environments that require back-breaking labor.
Malfian Sub-sector	The Malfian Sub-sector is a subsector of Imperial space, located in the Calixis Sector in Segmentum Obscurus.
Aggaros	Aggaros is a Feral World. Home to seemingly primitive natives, Aggaros was revealed to be a Thousand Sons enclave after the Adeptus Mechanicus attempted to mine the world and destroy the local population, culminating in the Feral War.
Missing in Action (Short Story)	Missing in Action is a short story in the Eisenhorn novel series by Dan Abnett. A series of mysterious murders in a hive city pique the interest of Inquisitor Gregor Eisenhorn. There's a commonality between them all that suggests something deeper than simply random acts of a crazed killer – but what could be behind the brutal slayings, and what will it mean for the safety of the entire city?
Adrantis Five	Adrantis Five was a human, hyper-technical planet which had been separated from the Imperium for over five thousand years. It was conquered by Lord Commander Solar Macharius during the Macharian Crusade in the Segmentum Pacificus. The planet's population were hyper-advanced, and when Macharius arrived he said that they had "turned to the dark certainties of science, and created many new and wondrous machines". General Tarka and his 3rd Army Group fought for the planet and over a 95% of its forces. Even so, Macharius still had to conquer it. He was held at bay for two years until the planet finally succumbed to a redirected comet so nothing remain of it now - to the much sorrow of the Adeptus Mechanicus. Still the Inquisition knows a much different story about the fall of Adrantis Five. "Of its secrets, nothing now remains" were the last words of Macharius on the subject.
Banish	Adeptus Astartes Homeworld Banish is the homeworld of the Exorcists Space Marine Chapter and their Fortress-Monastery, the Basilica Malefex. An isolated Feral World located in a quarantined sector of the Narasima Straits, Banish serves as the Exorcists' primary training and production centre. Banish has little in the way of natural assets or valuable infrastructure, but its hardy population which braves its acidic swamps are descended from Imperial prospectors stranded on the planet in an earlier age. They are a highly self-reliant people who have forgotten technology or galactic exploration.
Blossak	Blossak is a world of the Imperium. They supplied Imperial Guard Regiments to the Second Agrellan Campaign.
Age of Apostasy	The Age of Apostasy was one of the largest and most destabilizing periods in the history of the Imperium, occurring in M36, five millennia after the Horus Heresy. It grew out of the power struggle between two Imperial organizations, the Ecclesiarchy and the Administratum.[Needs Citation] The Ecclesiarchy is the ruler of the Imperial Cult, the bearer of the sacred word of the Emperor. It spread into the lives of every citizen and servant of the Imperium, from the most humble miner and scribe, to the greatest heroes and the most influential officials, including the High Lords of Terra. The High Lords believing, like every other citizen, that the Ecclesiarchy was speaking for the Emperor, would often follow their words in directing the Imperium. Though they did not actually speak the words of the Emperor, the Ecclesiarchy did little to retract this image, and soon they were indirectly controlling the fate of the Imperium, influencing legal changes, military deployments and organization, threat priority decision-making and where Imperial resources should be directed, often towards themselves.[Needs Citation] Eventually, the power of the Ecclesiarchy grew too much and the Fabricator-General of the Adeptus Mechanicus, aa group of Space Marine Chapter Masters, and eventually the Administratum, rallied together to fight against the control of the Ecclesiarchy.[Needs Citation]

Surgically precise individual strikes, indiscriminate destruction – all situations are catered for with a wide variety of craft from each and every warring race.
Battlefleet Gothic Magazine Issue 2	Battlefleet Gothic Magazine was a series of supplementary magazines for the game Battlefleet Gothic published by Fanatic Press between 2000 and 2004. As with Fanatic Press' other magazines, Battlefleet Gothic Magazine regularly featured articles written and submitted by hobbyists, and as such, the magazine's content had the potential to conflict with official background lore.

Caruana-W	Caruana-W is an Imperium world.
Algol	Algol is a Hive World of strategic importance, as it belongs to a trade-chain of densely populated Imperial planets. Algol found itself assaulted by a Tyranid invasion, and despite having a sizable standing army, the local planetary forces did nothing but provide meat for the alien attackers. Protectorship over the strategically important planet fell to the Ultramarines Chapter, and so the entire Second Company of the Ultramarines, commanded by Captain Severus, committed to cleansing the invasion and also called in the Third Company for aid. But whether the world was devoured or saved from the Tyranids is unknown.
Spinward Front	The Spinward Front is a region of the Calixis Sector that is consumed by conflict. The term is also used to refer to the many Imperial war efforts there to bring the region under control. In mid M39, much of the Calyx Expanse had been liberated from Xenos control by the Imperium. Many Rogue Trader houses arose to fill the void, hoping to rule these newly liberated worlds. The most successful of these Rogue Traders was Duke Severus I, who battled many foul Xenos, discovered vital Warp routes, and battled a gigantic Warp beast. He went on to forge a stable and prosperous Imperial rule over the Periphery Sub-sector. However, it soon became apparent that there was more to Severus than meets the eye, and he used his prestige and wealth to establish a private empire within the Calyx Expanse. In the end, though, Severus' deeds and popularity was outdone by Lord General Militant Drusus of the Imperial Guard, who soon became the dominant player in the Expanse at the expense of House Severus. Embittered, the Severus family would carry a grudge against the Imperium for centuries to come. In 779.M41, the latest ruler of House Severus, Severus XIII, began to plot ways to increase his own power. Looking to the Periphery Sub-Sector once more, Severus allied with the Dark Eldar warband known as the Children of Thorns. Providing the Dark Eldar human slaves in return for their aid, Severus was able to use the cruel xenos to conquer the weak Planetary Governors of the Periphery Sub-Sector and establish the private empire his ancestors had worked to achieve for generations. To try and keep his activities from attracting Imperial retribution, Severus avoided declaring formal secession and tried to keep his ties to the Dark Eldar as secretive as possible.
Moebius	Moebius is a Necron Tomb World and capital of the Nekthyst Dynasty. Moebius consists of countless crypts which take the form of an ever-shifting maze of hyperspace corridors, ensuring that no journey through the catacombs is ever the same, a fact many a Deathwatch kill-team has discovered to its cost.
Segmentum Pacificus	The Segmentum Pacificus is one of the five Segmentums into which Imperial dominion of the Galaxy is divided. Its Segmentum Fortress is located at Hydraphur,[1a] ruled by "the Lords of Hydraphur".[1b] During the Nova Terra Interregnum, the whole of Segmentum Pacificus was claimed by the Ur-Council of Nova Terra. Later thousands of worlds in Segmentum Pacificus were claimed by the Imperium in the Macharian Crusade, but many were subsequently lost in the Macharian Heresy. In 999.M41, whole swaths of Segmentum Pacificus would suffer from mass uprisings by disgruntled citizens collectively known as the Night of a Thousand Rebellions. Many outlaying planets as well as key worlds such as Darkhold, Minisotira, and Enceladus are swept up in the chaos. Even the Lions Defiant Chapter of Space Marines find their Homeworld the victim of insurgent activity. Since the uprisings began, communication with much of Segmentum Pacificus has been lost.
Anzyra	Anzyra is the current Homeworld of the Angels Sanguine Chapter. In 261.M33 it was invaded by the Night Lords, though the Chapter was able to fend off the attack.
Apocalypse (2013)	Warhammer 40,000: Apocalypse is a new edition of Warhammer 40,000 Apocalypse rule-set updated for the 6th Edition of Warhammer 40,000. The 296-page book is hardcover and fully colored. Apocalypse War Zone were self-contained supplements to the Apocalypse rules, based on a famous campaign from the history of the Warhammer 40,000 galaxy. Each War Zone book starts off with a detailed history that describes the course of the campaign, the famous battles that were part of it, and the combatants that waged the war. The background is followed by special rules, Strategic Assets, missions and Apocalypse Formations. Each Apocalypse War Zone includes a gatefold that unfolds to show a ‘battle report’ of an Apocalypse game set in that War Zone.
The Fly Lord	The Fly Lord is a Nurgle Daemon Prince who joined the Daemons under his command with the Warband of the Death Guard Chaos Lord Malek Vos in order to invade the Imperium world of Arthas. Despite the intervention of the Black Templars Marshal Armante and the Lastrati Crusade, The Fly Lord and Vos defeated the Imperium's forces defending Arthas and claimed it in Nurgle's name.

Leman Russ Battle Tank	Some text passages and/or images of this article have been removed due to insufficient Citations and placed under Quarantine on this article's Discussion page until proper citations have been provided. You can help to restore them to the article by finding the correct citations and re-integrating the quarantined text and/or images as described in the Help article on citations. The Leman Russ is the main Battle Tank of the Imperial Guard. This rugged and dependable tank has been used to equip the Guard for many centuries, and while fundamental changes in construction and appearance have occurred, its capabilities have changed very little. Able to operate in a variety of environments and withstand enemy fire while delivering powerful tank-killing blows. It was named after Leman Russ, the Primarch of the Space Wolves. During the Great Crusade the STC of the Leman Russ Battle Tank was discovered on Nova Borilia. The world had been part of the Noman civilization, which had enslaved a portion of humanity for millennia. The Noman were crushed by the Space Wolves, who recovered the STC and named its fruit in the honor of their Primarch.
St Dornas Port	St Dornas Port is an Imperial world, that in M42 was invaded by the Drukhari forces of the Kabal of the Black Heart. After indulging in cruel blood sports with the world's meager PDF, the Kabal clashed with the Imperial strike force sent to aid St Dornas Port. This included the Ultramarines, but the Kabal of the Black Heart revealed their prepared strategy for dealing with the vengeful Imperials. Their forces subsequently encircled the strike force and the Kabal is now hunting down the Imperials with relish.
Torison VII	Torison VII is a world of the Imperium, that was attacked by Huron Blackheart and his Red Corsairs. After the attack, Huron had the planet's Astropathic Choir flayed and used their skin to make bindings for the haft of his Power Axe.
Argo Secundus	Argo Secundus is an Imperium world that has been recently been threatened with the appearance of an approaching Tyranid Hive Ship. Luckily for Argo Secundus' population, a strike force from the Ultramarines Chapter has now arrived to destroy the Hive Ship, before it reaches the world.
Altarak	Altarak was the site of an ambush led by Khârn the Betrayer against the Warband of the Chaos Space Marine Zarghan Ironfist.[1a] Though Zarghan managed to survive the attack, his Warband was left nearly destroyed by it[1a] and all that remained to him was his ship, the Pride of Sin, and the dregs of his Warband, composed of Cultists, Rogue Psykers and Mutants.[1b]
Aktosha	Aktosha is a Slaanesh Daemon World and Crone World located within the Eye of Terror. It was the site of a battle between the Craftworld Saim-Hann forces of Autarch Uranash Skyblade and Slaaneshi Daemons.
Bakka	Bakka is the Naval Base for Segmentum Tempestus. It co-ordinates all naval forces in the region and dispatches ships when needed. Bakka is a young world, highly rich in mineral wealth. This led to its colonization by humans sometime during the Dark Age of Technology. The surface of the planet is a sea of lava on the surface of which floats black islands of basalt and granite. Occasionally, turbulent flow or a meteorite strikes cause fresh magma to burst from the ground. Giant machines manned by forced laborers constantly mine the world for its rich resources. The vast installations of the planet are built on the stable black rafts of rock, defended by adamantium walls and Defense Laser and Torpedo installations. Above these installations sit the vast shipyards of the Segmentum Tempestus Naval Base. Bakka's atmosphere is hot, acidic, and poisonous, consisting of oxides of nitrous, sulphur, and sodium mixed with ammonia. As a result of it's toxic atmosphere, loss rates among the miners are substantial.
Almarit	Almarit is a Daemon World. In 998.M41, Gha'Kharax, Bloodthirster of Unfettered Fury, led the Eightscarred and Skullsworn Warbands in invading Almarit, which at that time was a Fortress and Shrine World of the Imperium. Despite facing elements of the Imperial Fists and Raven Guard Chapters as well as several Regiments of Stormtroopers, the forces of Khorne succeeded in reconsecrating the planet's furnace-temples in bloody ceremonies of ritual sacrifice. When the last shrine fell, Almarit was dragged into the Warp and claimed by Khorne as a new Daemon world.
Al-Arach	Al-Arach is a cult-dominated Imperial world, and serves as a source of Imperial Guard Regiments.
Sabbat Worlds	The Sabbat Worlds (also known as the Sabbat Sector) is the name given to a group of star systems along the edge of the Segmentum Pacificus, named in honour of Saint Sabbat.[8f] Made up of over 100 star systems[5a][8f] (perhaps as many as a thousand[8g]), 160 of which are inhabited,[11a] the Sabbat Worlds region is subdivided into several discrete territories, most notably the Newfound Trailing Group, the Khan Group, the Cabal Systems, the Carcaradon Cluster, and the Erinyes Group.[Needs Citation] It is rumoured that the Blood Pact originally came from a system here.[Needs Citation]
Alexandrus	Alexandrus is a notorious Imperial Feudal World. Its ruling classes have intentionally suppressed Alexandrus into feudalism, to keep the world's serfs in line. While its Imperial Commander and courtly nobles enjoy all the benefits of Imperial techno-arcana, their people are left to scratch in the mud for a living. Alexandrus was created by the Games Workshop employee Andy Clark and appeared in White Dwarf 481.
Crusade of Fire	The Crusade of Fire, originally known as the Crusade of Light, was a major Imperial Crusade launched in M41 to reclaim the worlds of the Corvus Sub-sector. A large-scale operation, the Crusade of Fire was the largest Imperial Crusade since the Macharian Crusade of the early 41st Millennium.[1a] After nearly a thousand years, the Warp Storms that had isolated the Corvus Sub-Sector finally subsided. A Crusade to reestablish Imperial rule was immediately launched under Lord Militant Arian Vois and accompanied by no less than a dozen Space Marine Companies and a hundred Imperial Guard Regiments. However, as the first ships emerged from the Warp, Lord Vois' worst fears were confirmed as much of the Sub-Sector lay in chaos and madness. Worse still, much of it was overrun by Chaos Space Marines under the Daemon Prince of Nurgle Anathrax the Foetid who had already sacrificed entire planetary populations in a dark ritual that would cast the sub-sector back into the Warp. They had also discovered that a Dark Eldar raiding party known as the Prophets of War under Archon Viscount Rex was active in the sector, looking to acquire massive amounts of fresh slaves in the chaos.[1a] Launched amid great fanfare and a 14 day opening parade, the Crusade of Light set out to reclaim the Corvus Sub-sector. The basic plan was to land Administratum survey teams on every world who would make contact with the native populations and re-evaluate their ability to be integrated into the Imperium. Upon contact with hostile forces, Space Marine and Imperial Guard forces would forcibly take control of the planet. But no sooner did the Crusade fleet emerge from the Warp than the error of its intended plan was made clear. The Crusade of Light was too late: the Servants of Ruin stood ready for them with a fleet of Battleships. Thus it was that the Crusade of Light had become the Crusade of Fire. The Lord Militant ordered the immediate deployment of the Space Marine forces accompanying the Crusade en masse, and dozens of Thunderhawks carrying the Space Marines landed on key worlds even as other Astartes forces assaulted the Chaos fleet with Boarding Torpedoes.[1a]
Beta-Garmon II	Beta-Garmon II is a world of the Beta-Garmon Star Cluster. The capital of the Beta-Garmon Cluster, the planet is lined with fortress-cities around its equator. The greatest of these is Nyrcon, which serves as the command and control center of the entire Beta-Garmon Cluster. The city and its geostationary Star Fort, known as The Anvil, are also used as mustering points for Imperial forces. Beyond the cities is a vast wasteland given over to the Departmento Munitorum and Centurio Ordinatus for weapons testing while a graveyard of decommissioned vessels in orbit served as a firing range for the Imperialis Armada. During the Battle of Beta-Garmon Beta-Garmon II was home to the heaviest fighting including an infamous engagement where over a thousand titans clashed on both sides. The Imperial forces were led by Sanguinius himself while The Anvil was boarded by Azkaellon. However, the entire engagement was revealed to be a trap by Horus to draw attention away from Beta-Garmon III, and the traitorous Warmaster detonated The Anvil and showered Beta-Garmon II in a devastating field of debris that largely decimated both sides. After the battle the planet was claimed by the traitors but presumably reclaimed in the Great Scouring.
Fenris	Fenris is the homeworld of the Space Wolves Space Marine Chapter and their Fortress-Monastery, The Fang. It is located relatively close to the Eye of Terror. A planet of fire and ice, Fenris orbits its sun once every 3-4 Terran years.[8b] During the summer months volcanoes erupt, burning great areas with lava flows and churning the seas, spreading great floods and tidal waves.[10c] As the planet enters its long winter, the temperature drops so far that most of it actually ices over, giving the planet the appearance of a snowball from orbit.[Needs Citation] Apart from a single area of the planet that is permanently land-locked, Fenris is a world of shifting geography and mostly oceans.[2a] Numerous asteroid strikes, mutable coastlines and even swiftly risen or sunk island masses have resulted in the population becoming one of largely nomadic barbarian tribes. The tribes constantly seek secure territory, and as a result skirmishes and feuds over land between rival tribes are common. The people are hardened to the changes in temperature and extremes, and so is the fauna. The only continent that remains constant is Asaheim, standing on top of the crest of the world. During the summer, it is covered in lava and magma flows, but is habitable during the winter.[Needs Citation]
Appus IV	Appus IV is an Imperium Forge World which exports large calibre weaponry and may be the next target for an Ork Waaagh! that recently conquered the Forge World Glomus.
Newfound Trailing Group	The Newfound Trailing Group is a territory of the Sabbat Worlds region in the Segmentum Pacificus. Known worlds of the Newfound Trailing Group include:
The Horus Heresy Book Six - Retribution	The Horus Heresy Book Six - Retribution is the sixth book in the Horus Heresy series by Forge World. It covers the Shadow Wars of the Heresy: actions by the Knights-Errant, Shattered Legions, and Blackshields. The Horus Heresy Book Six - Retribution continues the unfolding saga of the Horus Heresy. As the fires of total war consume entire worlds and whole Legions clash, away from the front lines the Knights-Errant are abroad too, penetrating the warp storms that afflict the entire galaxy as they carry out a mission bestowed upon them by the very highest authority on distant Terra. The Shattered Legions pursue bloody vengeance against the hated Traitors, who in turn seek to hunt the Loyalist survivors down no matter where they might seek refuge. Blackshields — orphaned or outcast Legiones Astartes who have renounced their Legions and obscured their heraldry - harbour their own objectives, alone in the darkness, sometimes aligned with the Traitor cause, sometimes the Loyalist, but just as often for their own unknowable ends. This book explores the unseen Shadow Wars that raged across the entire galaxy as betrayed Legiones Astartes mounted bitter campaigns against their former brothers, determined that if death was to be their fate, their betrayers would share it. This tale is told across five chapters, describing five very different Shadow Wars of the Age of Darkness. Also included are a detailed campaign system and a set of special Shadow Wars missions, enabling players to undertake their own series of linked battles fought between the types of forces explored throughout the book.
Baalus Trine	Baalus Trine is a recruiting world for the Angels Sanguine Chapter; it was chosen due to its similarity to the Blood Angels' homeworld of Baal.
Loqiit	Loqiit is the homeworld of the Q'orl race, known by the Q'orl as the Swarmworld. The centre of their small but threatening empire, Loqiit itself is worshipped by the Q'orl as a holy world and is relatively uninhabited. Instead, most of its population live in hive-structures made from their dead which orbit the planet. The Q'orl guard their homeworld viciously with a space fleet, and over thirty thousand human pilgrims which strayed into the Q'orl Empire were massacred by the aliens in M41.
Agraria XIII	Agraria XIII is an Imperium world that contains an Aetherium Choir. During the 13th Black Crusade, the world received urgent reports that a wounded Void Whale and a Waaagh! led by the Freebooter Kaptain Badrukk were both heading towards the Death World Catachan. However, due to interference caused by the Warp Storm Bas Infernia, Agraria XIII's Aetherium Choir was unable to warn the Catachans of the threats coming to their world.
Badab Primaris	Rianoen	Rianoen is an Eldar Exodite World.
planet in the Badab system, located in the Ultima Segmentum, close to the Maelstrom warp rift. Badab Primaris is the capital of the Badab Sector. Once a homeworld of the Astral Claws Space Marine Chapter, it played a major role in the Badab War, which ended with the siege of Badab Primaris itself. The Imperial Mission took over the running of Badab after the war. It is now under the dominion of the Star Phantoms, along with the other worlds of the Badab Sector.
Aggenon	Aggenon was an Imperium Shrine World until M41, when it was devastated in a massive invasion by the Aeldari, which included every major Craftworld and several Harlequin Masques.
Aralan (Hive World)	Aralan is an Imperial Hive World, whose floating Hives were infected with the mind plague known as the Witch-curse. Citizens possessed of even the slightest psychic potential found their latent abilities blossom into uncontrollable storms of etheric energy and wreaked havoc in the Hives. Once word of the disaster striking Aralan reached a Black Templars Crusade, it arrived above the world and launched an all out assault on the infected population. The wrathful Black Templars cut down every citizen that stood in their path, as they successfully located and exterminated every infected psyker on the Hive World.
Daenyathos (Novella)	Daenyathos is a novella written by Ben Counter, featuring the Space Marine of the same name, and acts as a prelude to the events of Counter's Soul Drinkers (Novel Series). For millennia, the writings of Chaplain Daenyathos have been the guiding force behind the Soul Drinkers, his wisdom taking them from strength to strength. But a dark secret lurks at the heart of Daenaythos's Catechisms Martial, a cancer that will eat away at the Soul Drinkers and ultimately damn them. Spanning the centuries from the Age of Apostasy to his mysterious disappearance, this is the story of the Philosopher-Soldier's life, of his rise... and of his tragic fall.
Acreage	"The Emperor only asks that you obey." Acreage is an Imperial Feudal World. An Imperial backwater, Acreage lies in the sub-sector of Josian Reach and is connected to the rest of the Calixis Sector by a few tenuous shipping routes. Its tithes mainly consist of ore from its mines and men for the Imperial Guard. Designated as a Feudal World, Acreage's technology is medieval and its population consists largely of degenerate peasants and bickering nobles. The Grand Realm of Ascandia, the High King's realm, spans the majority of the northern landmass.[2a][3a] The world has seen much interference by the Inquisition, particularly by members of the Ordo Calixis. The Inquisitor Lord Khazul once used the world to test the mettle of his then-Acolyte, Inquisitor Lord Okonawk, leading to the deaths of Okonawk's entire Cadre and more than a hundred thousand Acreage civilians as well as Khazul by Okonawk's own hand. The world saw further devastation when the rogue psyker, The Burning Princess, worked in conjunction with the pirate vessel Storm Walker to consume the planet's Cathedral Mount in a holocaust of fire, slaying several senior clergymen and over ten thousand other pilgrims and citizens. Acreage has also been the site of a secret war between the Amalathian and Recongregator factions of the Inquisition for generations, with the Amalathians attempting to preserve Acreage's current isolationism, technology and royal dynasty while the Recongregators secretly attempt to introduce new ideas, practices and off-world technology.[5a][5b]
Warp storm	Warp Storms are volatile events in both the Immaterium and Materium linked to the nature of the Warp. The Warp is an extremely volatile medium. At times, disturbances can turn areas of the Warp into raging storms of incomprehensibly destructive fury. These storms can last for days, months, or even centuries. Ships caught in these storms, at best, might be blown off-course, to emerge thousands of light-years off course into uncharted areas of the galaxy, or can find themselves trapped inside the Warp, a terrible fate for its passengers as they become playthings for the dark creatures that inhabit the malign realm. Sometimes, a ship, after traveling through the Warp for only a short time, will emerge from the Warp and find that centuries have passed in real space. The storms also cut off Warp travel through certain regions, isolating systems from the Imperium for months, years, or even centuries. Some systems have always been isolated and show no hint of becoming otherwise. Particularly dangerous Warp Storms were noted during the Age of Strife, which led to the devastation of Humanity's interstellar realms. They only dissipated with the birth of Slaanesh.
Aldarast	Aldarast is an Imperium world.
Daemos III	Daemos III was the site of a battle for the Imperial Knights of House Hawkshroud.
Trantis	Trantis, known as the "Raider's Moon", is a Necron Tomb World located in Segmentum Tempestus. Its inhabitants frequently launch devastating raids on the nearby resource-rich Imperial world of Mandal.

Please help to improve this article by fixing those issues as described in the corresponding Help article. Do also note that it is absolutely forbidden to add new information or content to these marked passages as long as the pre-existing citation issues have not been completely resolved. The Crone Worlds are the remnants of the worlds of the Eldar Empire overwhelmed by the Eye of Terror during the Fall, and horrifically altered. These original homeworlds first colonised by the Eldar as they rose to power tens of thousands of years ago. The worlds are now known as Crone Worlds for the Eldar crone goddess, Morai-Heg.[Help] The region was overtaken by the Eye of Terror, its worlds consumed by Chaos but not destroyed, instead turned into nightmarish realities in limbo between Real Space and The Warp. Crone Worlds seem to be synonymous with Daemon Worlds. They are now the domains of the Ruinous Powers and their slaves along with the Chaotic Eldar[2a] and their ab-strains trapped there since the Fall.
The Periphery	The Periphery is a subsector of the Calixis Sector. Conquered in M39 as part of the Angevin Crusade to conquer the Calyx Expanse (which would later become the Calixis Sector) from unnamed hordes of xenos defenders,[3a] the Periphery Sub-Sector of Calixis was largely neglected by the Imperium. Treated more as a buffer against the unexplored Wilderness Space between the Calixis and Scarus Sectors than the center of power and trade that its conqueror, Severus I, wanted it to be. Although initially quite prosperous, it has since suffered a marked and steady decline over the past two millennia. Its natural resources and trade opportunities just were not as enticing as were those of neighbouring sub-sectors, and so the infrastructure that was needed for the region to thrive was not developed. Political sniping to prevent the overambitious Duke Severus from pursuing his goals by Lord Sector Drusus also restricted the sub-sector's development. This lack of early investment led to compounding losses of interest and inevitable stagnation.[3e] Generations later, in 779.M41 Severus the First's descendant, Severus the Thirteenth, took control of his family's dwindling holdings, and within twenty years, had managed to get appointed to the position of Lord Sub-Sector.[3c]

Please help to improve this article by fixing those issues as described in the corresponding Help article. Do also note that it is absolutely forbidden to add new information or content to these marked passages as long as the pre-existing citation issues have not been completely resolved. The Codex Astartes is the doctrine of the Space Marine Chapters, governing all aspects of Chapter organisation and battlefield tactics. For any given tactical situation, the Codex has hundreds of pages devoted to how it may be met and overcome. The wisdom of thousands of Imperial warriors has contributed to the Codex, and details on everything from unit markings to launching a full-scale planetary assault are contained within its pages.[25b] The Codex was written and formalised after the Horus Heresy by the Primarch of the Ultramarines, Roboute Guilliman. Some Chapters, such as the Ultramarines and their successors, regard the Codex as a holy text, and follow it without question. Many other chapters also follow the Codex, though not always as strictly as the Ultramarines; these two types of chapters are collectively known as Codex Chapters. Among the Ultramarines, each battle brother must memorise whole sections of the codex, so that within a company there exists an entire record of the text.
Altid 156	Altid 156 was a planet of pilgrims which had seceded from the Imperium. The planet was recaptured during the Altid Crusade by a force of Dark Angels. It was the base of operations for Fallen Angel Elucidax the Keeper. He was captured and returned to the Rock to extract a confession.

47 Kapella	47 Kapella is a War World near the Blackshine Nebula in the Calixis Sector. It is currently undergoing Imperial pacification.
The Tithes (Animated Series)	The Tithes is a 2024 Warhammer 40,000 animated series on Warhammer+. The Tithes is a three-part Warhammer animation anthology. It’s composed of three self-contained stories that each shine a different light on an interesting and little-explored slice of this vast, dystopian setting: The Imperial Tithe.
The Vorbis Conspiracy (Anthology)	The Vorbis Conspiracy is a Warhammer Crime anthology by Chris Wraight, Guy Haley, Graham McNeill, Darius Hinks, Alec Worley, Jude Reid and Noah Van Nguyen. Varangantua is in turmoil. After the district of Korsk is obliterated in a fiery cataclysm, the city’s enforcers must pick up the pieces. As sanctioner teams comb the wreckage for survivors, dogged probators such as Agusto Zidarov and Lycia Calix seek to uncover the truth about what happened. Their stories become intertwined with those of petty criminals and desperate citizens, even drawing the vaunted attention of agents beyond Alecto itself, painting a picture of sprawling conspiracy.
Attila	Attila is an Imperial world, famous for its Imperial Guard Attilan Rough Riders. Attila is a world consisting entirely of wide, arid plains. The world is somewhat smaller than Terra and has a single continent, covering nearly half of the planet's surface. The centre of this massive land mass is subject to such extremes of temperature that it remains uninhabited. It is a baking desert in the summer and a sub-zero expanse of sand and snow during winter. Beyond the continent's centre is rich savannah, punctuated with mountain chains, mighty inland lakes, and vast rivers. The continent is encircled near its coasts by verdant forests.
Ark Reach Secundus	Ark Reach Secundus is a world that was brought into the Imperium of Man by units of the 47th Expedition Fleet and a mixed taskforce of the Legiones Astartes during the Great Crusade. Known to the pre-Imperial inhabitants, the Avenians, as Heliosa, it was nicknamed Shrike by the Imperial elements who fought there. Ark Reach Secundus was the Cardinal World of the Avenian empire and offered significant resistance to joining the Imperium.[1a] The name Shrike is derived from a native bird used by the Avenians as line breakers to attack Imperial formations. These birds were described as partially fur-bearing with razor-sharp beaks.[1a] Discovered by the 47th Expedition Fleet towards the end of the Great Crusade, Heliosa (as it was then known) was part of an extensive planetary alliance that covered the majority of the systems within the Ark Reach Cluster. When the leaders of this alliance refused to join the Imperium, the Astartes of the 47th - the Word Bearers — and their attached Army units were turned loose. For reasons unknown (although presumably because of the size to cover and the relative power of the Ark Reach resistance) a significant portion of the Space Wolf Legion were tasked to the campaign shortly afterwards, with forces from the Thousand Sons subsequently assigned to aid the compliance as well.[1a]
A1709	A1709 is an Imperial Research Station.
Alantor X	Alantor X was the site of an ambush against the Angels of Retribution Chapter, which resulted in their complete destruction.
Jungle World	Jungle worlds are covered from pole to pole in one single planet-spanning jungle. "Jungle world" is not a technical planet classification, but a general term referring to its natural environment.[Needs Citation]
Tomb World	Tomb Worlds are the worlds which have been inhabited by dormant Necrons for millions of years. Their worlds exist in unknown numbers throughout many parts of the galaxy. A Tomb World is seemingly long abandoned, and many are thought to be the ancient worlds of the Necrontyr, since their architecture shows up on many of the planets. Tomb worlds have a tendency to be barren and lifeless desert worlds.[7a] Many Adeptus Mechanicus personnel sent to these planets for exploration are often never heard from again; the vile Necron inhabitants never having truly left over the millions of years they had been in stasis.[7a]
Cyris	Cyris is an Imperial world in Segmentum Obscurus known to raise Imperial Guard Regiments.[1a] Cyris was invaded by Waaagh! Gutcutta and was saved by an Imperial army group that included the Cadian 423rd Armoured Regiment.[1b]
Xenos World	Xenos worlds are non-human and non-Imperial worlds inhabited by alien races. Most alien races occupy only a single world or a small group of worlds. The majority of aliens are comparatively primitive, peaceful or powerless, and of little interest to humanity. Only a few alien races are powerful, aggressive and possess technology which rivals that of the Imperium. Of these, the most common are the Orks, Eldar, Necrons and Tau. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here. White Dwarf 139 (UK) (page 9) states that "Humanity is but one of many races in the galaxy. However, none are so widely distributed or so numerous as humans." Contradicting this however, several sources (including Codex: Orks (2nd Edition) page 4) clearly state that the Orks are the most widespread race in the galaxy. A possible compromise of these two opposing statements would be that the Orks are the more numerous race but are split into many fragmented factions, whilst the Imperium is the largest cohesive empire.
Au'taal	Au'Taal is a Tau sept established during the Second Sphere of Expansion. Au'taal Prime is a resort planet and is well known as a verdant and beautiful world, where only honoured heroes can retire.[1a] There are defensive platforms in the orbital space of this planet that bristle with weapon systems, because the Tau take the protection of their brave elders very seriously. Tau from this sept are known for their easygoing attitude toward their duty to the empire, and other Tau often regard them as lazy. The planet Au'taal is famous for its exotic fruits that are used when trading with other races.
Tolkhan	Tolkhan is an Imperial Forge World that is home to the Titan Legion Legio Pallidus Mor. It is also the Sector Capital of the Khaldun Sector and a vassal world of the Gryphonnen Octad as well.[3b] Tolkhan is a gravitationally locked planet, with one side permanently facing its star and the other the void. The starfacing side is covered in photovoltaic fields built to harvest the energy of the star and feed the massive underground cities and forges of the world. The voidfacing side of the planet has a large number of dockyards in stationary orbit. Subterranean cities and forges wormed through the rocky mantle of the planet's mantle for miles, wrapping about the circumference of the planet dozens of times over. The planet had been lifeless long before any human colonization.[3a] The planet has a unusually high mutation rate and large number of psykers are born there. The forge world is known to be proficient in psy-collars and other forms of immaterial restraints.[3a]
Altaneum	Altaneum is an Ocean World. During the Great Crusade, the Emperor of Mankind led a force including the Emperor's Children and Luna Wolves primarchs, Fulgrim and Horus, to the planet. The inhabitants of Altaneum refused to recognize the Emperor as their master and fought against compliance, eventually melting the polar ice caps to drown their world and deny it to the Imperium. Fulgrim would later relate the fate of Altaneum to Solomon Demeter on the surface of Twenty-Eight-Four and that the Emperor had told him and Horus not to make such a mistake again, because a wasteland of a galaxy would be a worthless prize.
Alsor	Alsor is an Imperial world located in the Helican Subsector. There is a Sacred Heart monastery located on the planet.
Maiden World	Maiden Worlds are the lush paradise worlds originally created by the Eldar before the Fall of their race. The creation involved seeding barren planets with life, gradually leading to their transformation into lush, life-supporting worlds. The seeding of worlds was part of a program of colonisation which would take many thousands of years to reach fruition, and the result would only be seen by later generations of Eldar. The development of a lifeless planet into a Maiden world was a slow one. The process was overseen by ancient Eldar Empire vessels known as Dominion ­Genesis. Simple bacteria were introduced to create a stable atmosphere first and gradually more complex organisms were added to stabilise the bio-system of the planet. Eventually, in the distant future the world would be ready to colonise by the Eldar. Once the process began it was fairly self-sustaining but took thousands of years to complete. These worlds are referred to by the Eldar as Lilaethan (Maiden worlds) after the Eldar goddess Lileath. They are often highly rich in resources and safe from illnesses as they were developed to resist harmful lifeforms. The Eldar consider these worlds their own, created by their forefathers for them to settle. As Eldar civilisation neared its Fall, many groups among the Eldar denounced their decadent societies, abandoning their homeworlds in a series of migrations called the Exodus. These Exodites traveled far away from their collapsing civilisation and settled the still barren Maiden worlds. The seeded worlds survived the Fall of the Eldar, and continued to develop on their own. In the Age of the Imperium these worlds are now verdant paradise worlds. Inevitably, many have been settled by non-Eldar races. Although these races may have lived on Maiden Worlds for thousands of years, the descendants of the colonists are considered invaders by Eldar. After the Fall, the Eldar began to settle the verdant worlds they created, sometimes finding their worlds already inhabited by other races. The "invaders" are given the choice of leaving or being exterminated. Even in cases where the colonists are feral savages with no means of leaving the planet, the Eldar have mercilessly followed through with the threat of extermination.
Archangelsk	Archangelsk was a gas giant that had seven of its moons colonized by the Imperium, who also installed several orbital defence platforms around its orbit. Over time, universities would be created on the gas giant's habitable moons and Archangelsk would become known in the Imperium as a centre of great wisdom and learning. This would all end with the coming of the Eternal Coil Chaos Cult in M36. The Cult began in one of Archangelsk's universities and soon spread to all of its habitable moons and defence platforms and sometime later came to the attention of Inquisitor Kayeda. In order to prevent the Cult from spreading its influence beyond Archangelsk, the Inquisitor sought the aid of the Soul Drinkers Chapter and secured the assistance of Captains Garn and Daenyathos' Companies. The Inquisitor and the Soul Drinkers Companies later returned to Archangelsk, aboard the Chapter's Strike Cruiser Gundog in 319.M36 and reclaimed the orbital defence platforms from the Eternal Coil's control. Once that crucial step was done, a large number of missiles capable of inflicting an Exterminatus on Archangelsk were taken from the Gundog's armoury, which had been supplied by the Inquisition, and were placed within the orbital platforms; they were all then fired at the same time, to ensure the gas giant's destruction. From the safety of the Gundog, the Soul Drinkers and Inquisitor watched as Archangelsk's resulting explosion destroyed not only its moons and orbital platforms, but also the entire Eternal Coil Cult.
Segmentum Solar	The Segmentum Solar is one of the Segmentums, divisions of the Galaxy, of the Imperium. Its Segmentum Fortress is located at Mars. Its most notable feature is Terra, the homeworld of mankind. Segmentum Solar is the core of Imperial space and represents the foundations of Mankind. It has been the most densely settled Human region of the Galaxy since the Dark Age of Technology.
Ariyo	Ariyo is a planet in the Dekradek system, unremarkable except for the secret repository of forbidden tomes gathered together by Mechlord Simbasa and his followers. Simbasa's heretic sect and its forbidden knowledge were purged by an Inquisitorial team lead by Ramius Stele. Another action took place on this planet involving Battle Sisters of the Adepta Sororitas, including Sister Miriya.
Hadex Anomaly	The spatial anomaly Hadex, also known as the "red hole" is a galactic anomaly of unknown origins, located in the Eastern Fringe. Defying categorisation and possibly even sentient, it is believed to constantly spew time from other dimensions into the southern spiral arm of the galaxy, distorting any attempts to control or monitor it. On occasions, it outright reorders the flow of events.[4b] The outskirts of Hadex are dotted with ghost ships, trapped there in a kind of stasis field. The stars near the anomaly are contaminated by it, and are known as the Charon Stars.[2a] The Hadex Anomaly first manifested in 656.M40, and became visible instantaneously across Ultima Segmentum regardless of distance.[2b]

Anvilus Nine	Anvilus Nine was a Forge World of the Imperium. This planet is most known for being entirely devoted to the production of Land Raiders during the Great Crusade, and was set to this purpose due to the huge demand of the vehicles among Imperial forces. It created the first Land Raider, the Land Raider Proteus. In time of Horus Heresy planet was captured by the Dark Mechanicus' renegade Tech-Priests and the supply of Land Raiders to Imperium forces was stopped. It is unknown whether Anvilus Nine was recaptured by the Imperium's armies or not. The Forge World was renowned for its Autocannon patterns, most famously the Anvilus Snub Autocannon.
Knight World	Knight Worlds are technologically-advanced feudal worlds, ruled by an aristocratic elite of noble families known as Knight Houses. Knight worlds were founded during the ascendency of mankind in the Dark Age of Technology, when humanity first began to spread out from Terra and the Sol System. The initial impetus to settle these worlds was based on the burgeoning race's need for raw materials, be it fertile worlds for agriculture or mineral-rich worlds for mining.[1a] The Long March fleets despatched from Terra contained massive colony ships each filled with thousands of settlers; these ships would then be deconstructed upon landing to provide the initial materials for settlement. In addition to the colony ships, the fleets included advanced Knight suits and their pilots. These Knights were often the difference between a colony thriving or foundering, and their pilots commanded enough power to be considered their worlds' de facto rulers.[1b]
Adrantis Nebula	Adrantis Nebula (or Adrantis, or Adrantis Subsector) is a subsector of the Calixis Sector. It is the home of the Magos Genetus Halix Redole, who is dedicated to eradicating genetic corruption in Adrantis.
Moebian Domain	"The Moebian Domain is full of established worlds, burgeoning settlements and far-flung colonies." The Moebian Domain, or Moebian Sector,[3m] is a fiefdom of several important Imperial worlds. It is ruled by Lord Margrave of Atoma Prime, from his seat of power in Hive Tertium where he holds court. Located in the galactic northwest of Segmentum Solar,[2a] the Domain occupies a significant tract of space. The capital world of the Moebian Domain is Atoma Prime. Although the Domain is sparsely populated, it offers important tithes of fuel, arms, and soldiers to the wider Imperium. Over this significant tract of space, sparse clusters of planetary systems make up the Moebian Domain.
Fight or Flight (Short Story)	Ciaphas Cain's early years come to light as he fights alongside the Valhallan 12th Field Artillery on the world of Desolatia. Having just been made a full Commissar, Ciaphas Cain arrives on the mining world of Desolatia IV to begin his service with the Valhallan 12th Field Artillery regiment who are part of a force eliminating an Ork raiding party. After settling into his easy (and nearly oxymoronic) role of likable Commissar, the Orks are eventually defeated, whereupon contact is lost with the Keffia task force fleet inbound to pick them up. Colonel Mostrue is unperturbed, but Cain's gut senses the approach of Tyranids, and he advises Mostrue to keep the battery on full alert. Cain's inkling proves correct when a minor splinter fleet of 100 hundred bio-ships arrives in-system and proceeds to invade the planet, where they attack the Valhallan forces. Cain's regiment holds fast in the face of Mycetic Spores until they are assaulted by a force of Gargoyles. Seizing this as his chance to escape to the spaceport, Cain has Jurgen dutifully drive him away from the base in a Scout Salamander. Cain's attempt at escape is foiled, however, as he runs into the main force of Tyranids moving to flank the Valhallans. Warning Mostrue to reposition the Hydra platforms, he and Jurgen flee back to the artillery fire-base, only to have the Salamander break down a short distance from the base, leaving Jurgen and Cain with the only option to run like hell. Just as Cain nears the fortifications Jurgen trips, only to be assaulted by a brood of Gaunts, whereas Cain has his forward route blocked off by a Hive Tyrant. Caught between the frying pan and the fire, Cain chooses the fight he has a chance in hell of winning and runs back to save Jurgen from the Gaunts. As he is doing so, the Tyrant and its bodyguards evaporate behind him under the guns of Hydra platforms, which leaves the Tyranids without a connection to the Hive Mind, and they retreat. Later, the Keffia fleet arrives and leisurely destroys the Hive fleet in orbit.
Aoid's Sepulchre	Aoid's Sepulchre was an Imperial Shrine World which was the first world where Saint Katherine launched her War of Faith. It was the first step in a pilgrimage of the Imperial Cult called the Pilgrimage of Fire. It is located in Imperium Nihilus. [1a] The planet was attacked by Chaos forces after the opening of the Great Rift and left with breathable atmosphere but none of the population left alive. The planet was named after Aoid who was buried in a tomb on the world but her remains were stolen by the forces of Chaos. [1b]

Archos	Archos was the site of a battle for the Ultramarines, following the Chapter's devastation in the First Tyrannic War.
Ral'eth	Ral'eth was a Sept World of the T'au Empire, until its forces there were destroyed by a Skullsworn Warband led by the Daemon Prince Agrand the Annihilator.
Arkhona	Arkhona is a planet home to the Eternal Crusade. Arkhona is the fifth planet of the Kharon System and a former Imperial World. It was inhabited by humans tens of thousands of years ago, but when recently the Ordo Xenos arrived on the planet, it turned out that the entire population had been destroyed. Shortly afterwards, research units of the Inquisition also disappeared without a trace.
Alpha Shalish	Alpha Shalish is a dead and forgotten Imperial world. Human colonists first discovered Alpha Shalish in the early Age of Technology. The red world orbiting twin suns had an ideal environment but also contained a xenos species that resisted colonization attempts. After a sustained campaign of extermination, the native species was destroyed and the human colonists moved in, burying or destroying the ancient relics of previous inhabitants. With the discovery of mineral-rich worlds in nearby systems, Alpha Shalish became a thriving port world. Alpha Shalish grew into a shining example of human ingenuity, with towering hive cities, robotic defences, and automated agriculture. The world welcomed emerging psykers. Suddenly, interstellar communication collapsed, heralding the Age of Strife.
Purge III	Purge III is an Imperial Shrine and Death World, that is among the many that epitomize some aspect of suffering and martyrdom. Its population resides within vast crawler cities, that keep pace with the rolling firestorm of the world's terminator. These cities crush under their tracks the blackened remains of those who showed insufficient fervour in their race for survival. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Ashen	Ashen is a Cemetery World in The Periphery subsector of the Calixis Sector.
Altair VII	Altair VII is an Imperial world.
Nihilas	Nihilas is the homeworld of the Death Strike Space Marine Chapter.
Ghorsk IV	Ghorsk IV is an Imperial world in M42, where Astra Militarum forces are stationed. In an attempt to weaken the Imperium's Guardsmen, the Necron Overlord Trazyn the Infinite hacked into an Imperial database and began issuing false guidelines the Astra Militarum should use while fighting the Necrons. He then stated the guidelines should be spread as much as possible and that they must be read specifically by the Guardsmen on Ghorsk IV, in the next 30 hours. Shortly afterwards, though, the Inquisition was notified of Trazyn's hacking and were able to expel the Overlord from the database.
Adeptus Astartes Homeworld	A Space Marine homeworld or a Chapter Planet is the base for a Space Marine fortress-monastery.[3a] For some Chapters the world also serves as their sole recruiting world; other chapters draw their recruits from several planets.[3a] A "Chapter planet" is an Astartes world which is both governed by the chapter and which serves as the base for their fortress-monastery.[3a] Astartes homeworlds may be Imperial planets, while some are not planets at all, but take the form of orbiting spacecraft, deserted moons and asteroids. The commander of the chapter is often also the traditional ruler of the chapter planet, in which case the Chapter Master also holds the rank of Planetary Governor.[3b] Chapter Planets are exempt from normal Imperial Tithes. Many Astartes homeworlds are Feral Worlds, which provide the best warriors. Not all Space Marine Chapters have a single homeworld; some chapters such as the Imperial Fists, Black Templars and Blood Ravens take their aspirants from several different worlds. Entirely fleet-based chapters do not possess worlds, and instead recruit from any convenient and promising worlds. Several Space Marine Chapters guilty of treason (but those still deemed redeemable), such as the Mantis Warriors and Executioners, have been forced to forfeit their homeworlds - which forces them to become totally fleet-based chapters.
Alayran	Alayran is an Eldar Maiden World. In 631.M41 the Farseers of Alaitoc foresaw a vicious assault from an Ork Waaagh! on Alayran and the Craftworld's forces acted quickly to save the Maiden World. With their Rangers too far away to aid them, Alaitoc awakened their Ghost Warriors and hid them in concealed positions across the planet. When the Orks arrived on Alayran, the Ghost Warriors struck and made pinpoint attacks on the Waaagh!'s leaders, which quickly dismantled it and drove the remnants from the Maiden World.
Amistel Majoris	Amistel Majoris is a world of the Imperium. Located close to the Eye of Terror, the planet came under overwhelming attack from the Plague Fleet of Typhus during the 13th Black Crusade.
Terzari	Terzari has become a site of a battle for the Salamanders 3rd Company, led by Captain Adrax Agatone, sometime after the Great Rift's creation.
Kallash	Kallash is an Imperial Feudal world. As a result of a crashed ork ship, the world's forests have been infested with feral orks. The local militia dealt with the crash-landed orks, but they weren't able to erase the orks completely, resulting in the orks slowly growing in number over the years.[1a] To counter the growing ork threat, the Mordian 17th has been deployed on the planet. The regiment was mired fighting the orks in the infested Dirkr Forest for months.[1b] The Guardsmen were also plagued by an unknown local fungal spore infection, which hospitalised many Mordians.[1c]
Amistel	Amistel is an Imperium world which raises the Amistel Imperial Guard Regiments, including the Amistel 24th Cavalry Regiment. During the 13th Black Crusade, the world (presumably Amistel Majoris) was invaded by Plague Marines, and only with the arrival of the Drookian Fen Guard, Howling Griffons and Legio Astorum did the tide begin to turn. However, vessels of the Death Guard later appeared in Amistel's orbit and unleashed a viral contagion onto the world, more virulent than anything the Apothecaries had seen before. Its atmosphere is now so toxic that even Space Marines are unable to remain within it for long, and the fighting between the Imperium and the forces of Chaos has now devolved into vicious trench warfare as the world falls into a state of anarchy.
Caerthorn	Caerthorn was the site of a victorious battle for the Dark Angels Legion during the Great Crusade.
Alphex	Alphex is a world of the Imperium. At some point prior to 241.M41 Alphex suffered from the presence of a warp-cult. The cultists were known to remove their dead victims' hands and tongues.

Sable	Sable is a world of the Imperium. At one point, the governors of Sable were executed by the Blood Angels for their heinous crimes of chronomancy. After the formation of the Great Rift, Sable became stranded within the Dark Imperium. Its populace was largely butchered by the Ten Thousand Eyes Chaos warband as part of a plan by its master Seraphax to ensnare the recently returned Lion El'Jonson. However, the Chaos plan was foiled, and Sable became part of the growing Lion's Protectorate.
Brannik	Brannik is an Imperial Shrine World, that has been conquered by the Word Bearers. However, the Ultramarines Chapter's 2nd Company have arrived to liberate the world.
Damocles Gulf Crusade	The Damocles Crusade, also called the Damocles Gulf Crusade, was a major conflict fought between the Imperium of Man and Tau Empire in late M41 around the Damocles Gulf region of the Eastern Fringe. By 742.M41, members of the Tau Water Caste had established trade agreements with Imperial Worlds on the frontier, near the Damocles Gulf, and exchanges of goods and technology were common. Alarmed by this, Inquisitorial investigation of the worlds in question indeed found evidence of Tau activity. The conclusion was that they represented a major threat and Cardinal Esau Gurney of Brimlock called for a Crusade to purge the aliens. The Crusade was based around a dozen capital starships of the Imperial Navy, five provisional companies of Space Marines, and nineteen Regiments of Imperial Guard, seven of them from Brimlock. The first move was towards the Timbra Sub-sector where human colonists had coexisted with the aliens. The Crusade first reasserted Imperial rule in the rebellious Garrus and Kleist colonies. Individuals implicated in dealing with the Tau were seized and punished at a special assize held before the furious Crusaders. The Imperial colonies secured, the Crusade forces moved on and engaged the Tau for the first time on their own territory in the uninhabited Hydass System.[4a] At the Battle of the Hydass System, the Imperial Navy would face seven Tau Cruisers of the Air Caste. Initially surprised by the range and power of Tau torpedo salvos, the Imperial forces eventually emerged victorious with the help of a Space Marine Strike Cruiser and the discovery that Tau ships lacked heavy broadside firepower. Space Marine forces from the Scythes of the Emperor supported by the Brimlock Dragoons then landed on Sy'l'kell, a Tau world of seven million inhabitants. Finding the Tau forces to be extremely well-equipped mobile infantry and that the Hammerhead grav-tank was a close match for the Imperial Leman Russ Battle Tank, Imperial forces took heavy losses but intervention by the Scythes of the Emperor not only led to victory but avoided an outright massacre. After overcoming the Tau defenders and exterminating the alien populace the crusade moved on to their next target. As Imperial forces now made preparations to cross the Damocles Gulf, Imperial ships launched an orbital bombardment of the Tau world of Viss'el after finding it had no strategic value. The world's polar ice caps melted and all life was purged.[4a]
Chiros	Chiros is an Imperial Agri World. It is wealthy, covered in lush forests and continent-sized lakes. Its beauty is famed across the sector. Its populace numbers only a few million, most of whom are involved in the production of rejuvenating elixirs, fine furs and rare narcotics created from its natural flora and fauna. It is the homeworld of Confessor Dolan Chirosius and Jan van Yastobaal. During the Plague of Unbelief, the apostate Cardinal Bucharis' forces landed on Chiros, and began the conquest of the wealthy planet. They initially encountered little resistance. Soon though, they came up against an obstacle they could not overcome. Bucharis was not being kept filled in on the situation properly and could not understand why his troops failed to conquer the planet. The commander of the assaulting forces had restrained from using orbital bombardment, as he had seen the planet as a Paradise World to which the Cardinal could retire. Bucharis was pleased with his foresight and sent an extra three companies of troops, although this just prolonged the fighting and led to the surrender of Bucharis' forces.
Balmoran	Balmoran is an Imperial world and is the Homeworld of the Vindicare Assassin Raithe, whose father once served as its Planetary Vice-Governor.
Paradise World	A paradise world (also known as pleasure world and garden world) is a class of planet characterised by its outstanding natural beauty. Its natural conditions are perfect for human habitation. They have little, if any, industry and low populations. Instead of populating or industrializing these rare planets, some are retained in their natural state and used as recreational bases for important Imperial servants. On these planets, warriors may train their bodies and minds for war, studying arcane battle-philosophy and practicing martial arts. They are known to be havens for Imperial Nobles who possess wealth beyond measure. Sometimes the nature of these worlds makes them rife with temptation and heresy. The garden world is a sub-classification of civilised class.
Predator	The Predator is a battle tank employed by the Space Marines. It is a more heavily armed and armoured version of the Rhino personnel carrier. There are two major patterns of Predator, the Destructor and the Annihilator, primarily distinguished by their specific weaponry. The Blood Angels and their Successor Chapters employ the assault-oriented Baal Predator. Construction of Predators remains restricted to a Chapter's Armoury or allied Forge World, with most Chapters fielding between twenty to thirty of all types.[1a] However, some Chapters are known to contain several hundred battle tanks, though that number includes Land Raiders as well. Rhinos can be easily refitted to serve as Predators, with the Death Spectres for example converting twelve Rhinos into Predators after losing almost all Predator Destructors during the Vern IV offensive.[14a] Every thirteenth vehicle outfitted to be a Predator is blessed and purified to a greater degree than usual and every 666th is melted down, its material returned to the forge and sacrificed to the Machine God.[14a]
Bararat	Bararat the Tunnel World is an Imperial world where the fortress of a long-dead Xenos culture was recently discovered. A force of Space Marines were sent to investigate the fortress, unaware that it is now home to a large underground community of primitive nocturnal Humans. To make matters worse, deserters from Bararat's Imperial Guard garrison camped in the fortress not realizing that the primitives live under it. Night fell on Bararat, when the Space Marines approached the fortress, just as the nocturnal primitives begin to leave their tunnels and the deserters suddenly realized that they had been discovered. In the mayhem that followed, all three groups have begun attacking each other.
Solek	Solek was the site of a battle between Orks and the Ultramarines' Fulminata demi-Company some time after the Great Rift's creation.
Anark Zeta	Anark Zeta is a planet inhabited by Ogryns. These are used to raise Abhuman Regiments, known as the Ogryns of Anark Zeta, to serve in the Imperial Guard. The world was the site of the massive War in the Shedim Drifts during the Great Crusade.
Balecaster	Balecaster is a Feudal World of the Imperium, located in the Calixis Sector.
Avignor	Avignor is a Cardinal World, and the diocese of Cardinal Armandus Helfire, located northwest of the Eye of Terror.[Help] The planet saw the Adepta Sororitas' first use of the Repressor vehicle in quashing an uprising of incited pilgrims.[Help] This article needs work on its citations.For help on citation see the citation guidelines. You can help Lexicanum by fixing it.
Brycantia	Brycantia is the homeworld of the Iron Knights Space Marine Chapter. Located within Segmentum Obscurus, Brycantia is the homeworld of the Iron Knights Space Marine chapter. It is a heavily-industrialised planet, covered in dense fortifications and sprawling manufacturing works, in which its population toil under repressive overseers. Both the chapter and the world's people accept this brutal hardship as a necessity, knowing that sacrifice is vital to keep the Iron Knights girded for war. In Ben Counter's novel Phalanx, the Iron Knights' homeworld is named Seheris.
Mining World	Some text passages and/or images of this article have been removed due to insufficient Citations and placed under Quarantine on this article's Discussion page until proper citations have been provided. You can help to restore them to the article by finding the correct citations and re-integrating the quarantined text and/or images as described in the Help article on citations. A Mining or Ю class World is a classification for worlds rich in materials what manufactorums and forge worlds are looking for. Enslaved and penal workers harvest these worlds of their mineral riches, whether they are gas, ore or any other mineral demanded by the Imperium. Many of these worlds are inhospitable to humans.
Krakiota	Krakiota is a Daemon Prince of Khorne, who rules the Daemon World Bulwark in the Hadex Anomaly.

Troxx	Troxx is an Imperial world whose corrupt Planetary Governor rebelled against the Imperium in the aftermath of the Great Rift's creation. However, the Raven Guard Chapter has arrived to end his rule and have already laid siege to the Governor's heavily fortified palace.
Ghoma VI	Ghoma VI is a world that contains cannibal tribes, who worship the Chaos God Slaanesh as the Feastbringer. She is depicted as a slavering maw, that is as vast as a canyon and whose hunger for Human flesh can never be sated.
Adumbria	Adumbria is an Imperial Civilised World. It is in a rotationally locked orbit around its sun, meaning that one side of the planet is a sun-baked desert, while the other half is locked in a perpetual night, an arctic hemisphere. Despite its unusual orbit, it is one of the system's main life-supporting planets. The majority of the population lives within the "Shadow Belt," the equatorial region that lies between the two extreme hemispheres. There are inhabitants on both hemispheres, although they lead somewhat harsh lives. There are two main cities in the Shadow Belt, one based over one of the inland oceans fed by the dark side's glacial movements, and the other, Skitterfall, which is recognised as the planetary capital due to the fact that it contains the largest spaceport.[1a][1b] In 937.M41, the planet was invaded by a Chaos warband known as the Ravagers.[1c] Disaster was averted through the intervention of the Imperial Guard.
Anathrax (Planet)	Anathrax is a Daemon World in the Eye of Terror devoted to Nurgle. A lush but pestilent planet, Anathrax is full of giant bulbous fungi, made up of puffy-eyed heads that cough and sneeze a grey mucous which corrupts those who touch it. During the Abyssal Crusade, the Iron Drakes chapter was ambushed on the planet by its vile vegetation and Plague Marines, resulting in their eventual corruption into the Grey Death.
Anetarbraxus	Anetarbraxus was an Imperium Forge World. It created the Vultarax during the Age of Strife and later distributed its designs to other Forge Worlds after it joined the Imperium during the Great Crusade. However, Anetarbraxus was later completely destroyed during the Great Crusade, in an incident known as the Great Mandragoran Incursion, and the Vultarax now serves as a memorial of sorts for the lost Forge World.
Antasic IX	Antasic IX was a Forge World of the Imperium. However, the planet sided with the Traitors during the Horus Heresy.
Antioc	Antioc is a Forge World that was captured by Chaos forces during an incursion from the Prath Nebula. It is currently lost to the Imperium.
Segmentum Naval Base	A Segmentum Fortress is an orbital base for fleet operations throughout its associated Segmentum. Each of the five Segmentae, the Imperium's primary administrative/fleet zones, has a Segmentum Fortress or fleet base. These bases are huge ports with docks, shipyards and repair facilities. In reality however, relatively few of the fleet ships ever travel to their theoretical base. The main function of a fleet base is fleet administration. A Segmentum Fortress is controlled directly by an Administratum Master.[Needs Citation] The fleets based in each Segmentum are led by a Lord High Admiral; these commanders may hold a place amongst the High Lords of Terra.
Boonhaven	Boonhaven is an Agri World in Segmentum Pacificus, and is part of the Cabulis System. Currently it and the entire Cabulis System are under attack by Waaagh! Gragnatz.
Forbidden World	Quarantined Worlds are an Imperial classification of planet. These worlds are too dangerous to settle or explore, but still seen as too valuable to destroy or ignore completely. These planets are placed under strict quarantine by the Administratum or Inquisition and sometimes are even blockaded to ensure that nothing may enter or leave its surface until the Imperium can properly utilize them.
Asurya	The Asurya were a warrior order of Eldar emerging after the Fall. Known as the children of Asur, they were students of Asurmen, the first Phoenix Lord. Learning from their master mental discipline and the ways of the Path of the Warrior, notable Asurya included Jain Zar, Baharroth, Fuegan, and Arhra, who all went on to become Phoenix Lords.
Silence	Silence is the homeworld of the Night Watch Space Marine Chapter.
The 13th Black Crusade (Background Book)	The 13th Black Crusade is a Warhammer 40,000 background book written by Andy Hoare[1a]. It features maps from the 13th Black Crusade and accompanying descriptions of battles and important characters. The 13th Black Crusade was first published in 2004[1a]. During the production of this book, the following persons were involved considerably:[1a]
Ambold Eleven	Ambold Eleven is a planet in the Sabbat Worlds Cluster, which was occupied by the forces of Chaos. Close to the Sabbat Worlds Crusade's initial line of advance, Ambold Eleven was advocated, during the planning phase of the Crusade as an initial target for invasion, especially by Lord Militant Dravere, as part of his "mid-line assault" approach. Instead, Warmaster Slaydo vetoed Dravere's proposal, leaving Ambold Eleven as an objective of the second phase, Operation Newfound.[1a] The assault by a joint Guard and Naval task force began in 756.M41. Admiral Karslae swiftly overwhelmed the orbital forts and Chaos fleet, establishing void superiority and allowing General Dilen Belfry to drop his forces into the important cities of Pelbury Civitas, Upper Ganff, and Amboldus Hive.[1a]
Robots	Robots are artificial constructs capable of completing complex tasks automatically. Robots are used by a variety of factions across the Galaxy both past and present. During the Dark Age of Technology Humanity heavily used robotic constructs. This culminated in the creation of the Men of Iron, which eventually revolted against their masters in a devastating war. Due to traumatic experiences with the Men of Iron, the Imperium, even in its early days, had strict laws forbidding the creation of Silica Animus or Abominable Intelligence. Imperial Robots, known as Automata, are far more simplistic by comparison and heavily regulated by bodies such as the Legio Cybernetica of the Adeptus Mechanicus. The Imperium further restricts the need for complex robotics by utilizing biologically based Servitors for tasks traditionally reserved for robots.

They also make use of as much moisture as they can get out of the parched planet, setting up large water traps. Tarentus is part of a group of three agri-systems, along with Quintarn and Masali, known collectively as the "Three Planets". Just after the Battle of Macragge, a group of Ork scavengers arrived on the 'Three Planets' and proceeded to conquer them.

Dellerax	Dellerax is a remote Imperium world that was invaded by the Eldar of Craftworld Saim-Hann in 859.M41. Cadian Imperial Guard Regiments came to Dellerax aid and two years later drove the Eldar from the world.
Athonos	Athonos is an Imperial Civilized World.[1a] Governance of Athonos is vied for by dozens of rival families. The resultant gang warfare - fought in the streets and sewers of the hydroponic gardens - is brutal and unending. It is most well known for the regiments it raises for the Imperial Guard, the Athonian Tunnel Rats.[1b] Athonos is a shadow-shrouded world that was unknowingly built upon the resting place of the Necron Pirate King, Thaszar the Invincible. This ended in late M41, when Thaszar awoke from his Great Sleep and moved his colossal Tomb Ship from beneath Athonos' surface. The resulting destruction caused from its reemergence levelled Athonos' capital, though the Necrons left the rest of the world relatively unscathed. The luck of Athonos' population further held when Thaszar did not realize they were sentient beings and left for the void, stopping only to destroy a holo-stealthed Eldar listening post that was stationed in the world's orbit.
Revelation (Short Story)	The war for Machoria goes poorly for the Imperium. Sisters of Battle and Astra Militarum troopers alike have died in droves, fallen to the bloody rampage of Arnokh the Bloodlord. Of the Adepta Sororitas who defended the world, only one remains.

As she battles the traitor Space Marine, Celestine remembers her life before death and rebirth, and her journey of faith and fury.
Libethra	Libethra is an Imperium planet, although largely destroyed. The planet Libethra was gifted to the Angels Revenant Space Marine Chapter for their role in Saint Marduk's War of Faith in the Orpheus Sector. In 3086991.M41, the system of the planet was invaded by the Necron Maynarkh Dynasty. Such was the resistance of the Angels Revenant that the xenos were forced to break through Libethra's crust and unleash the planet's molten core to destroy the Chapter with their home planet. Despite these drastic measures, however, the war on the planet did not end, as the remnants of both the Angels Revenant as well as the Necron ground forces survived in caverns deep beneath Libethra's surface, continuing their battle. Eventually, this was discovered by an Imperial Torchbearers fleet which helped to destroy the remaining Necrons and reclaimed what was left of the planet.
Alyandu	Alyandu is an Eldar Maiden World that was once colonized by humans, until they were killed by the forces of Craftworld Saim-Hann.

It is also an ancient and formerly highly influential Hive World, the Techmage Lords of Belecane have, in recent centuries, lost much of their influence within the Adeptus Mechanicus. Unique ancient and barely understood technology of stasis weapons is considered commonplace amongst its population, to the point when young adepts know more about it than the most senior Tech-Priest can elsewhere.[1a] Although their prime in this specialization is now considered to have waned, seemingly dedicated to only hoarding its technologies and jealously guarding its sacred wisdom. The planet is also long well associated with the construction of protective barriers, void shields and Gellar fields. The planet holds also a service of storing items in its stasis vaults for anyone willing to save them from the trepidations of time.
Waaagh! Gragnatz	Waaagh! Gragnatz is an Ork Waaagh! that devastated the planets of Vorsk Subsector in M41. It began as a force of a few hundred Orks besieging the Agri World of Iornis and grew quickly as various Ork forces joined the fighting. Rival Warbosses split off to launch their own Waaaghs! with varying degrees of success and the progress of the Waaagh! was slowed by the presence of the warprift 'Hellfury', but emerged bolstered by the presence of Kogtoof's Ork fleet, encountered on the fringes of the rift. By the time Gragnatz's Grand Armada reached the Vorsk Sector its numbers were further swelled by the Big Bosses of Orguk, forming a galactic onslaught, capable of crushing several systems at once.
Brimlock Dragoons	The Brimlock Dragoons are Imperial Guard Regiments. Dragoons are organized not in squadrons or troops like cavalry, but in companies similar to infantry regiments. Officers and non-commissioned officers bear infantry ranks. Dragoon is the traditional name for a soldier trained to fight on foot but who transports himself on horseback, or in the case of the Brimlock Dragoons, Chimeras.

Anvillus	Anvillus is a Forge World of the Imperium. Dating back to the time of the Great Crusade, it was known to be one of the few Forge Worlds that could rival Mars in manufacturing capacity. During the Great Crusade, the Blood Angels established a long tradition of acting as the honour guard of Anvillus. By the outbreak of the Horus Heresy, a demi-company was stationed on the Forge World as it tore itself apart in civil war between the loyalist and traitor Mechanicum. Though order was eventually restored to Anvillus, none spoke of the fate that befell the Blood Angels there. However, each year on the exact anniversary of the Anvillus war, a warp-barge from Anvillus arrives at Baal bearing tribute in the form of exactly one half a company's worth of arms and armor. Anvillus is known for the construction of Warlord Battle Titans of the Mars-Alpha Pattern.
Estaban III	Estaban III is a Forge World and the third planet in the Estaban System. It is home to the Legio Tempestor. Though it is stated as a homeworld of the Legio Tempestor, during the Horus Heresy, the world was home to a machine cult known as the "Teleologicalica" which rejected the Emperor as the Omnissiah. Estaban III forged close ties with the treacherous Legio Tempestus Princeps Maximus Karania and sided with the traitors. Thereafter, the Forge World became the base for treacherous Legio Tempestus elements.[4b] At some point during the Horus Heresy or the Great Scouring, Estaban III was ultimately retaken by the Imperium; loyalist Blackshields who had once been Night Lords played a major role in this campaign.[4a] In 751.M41, Estaban was invaded by the forces of Chaos but saved by the Iron Hands and Legio Tempestor.

Koorqosan	Koorqosan is a world of the Imperium. Claimed by the Imperium during the Great Crusade, Koorqosan was subsequently enveloped by the Warp and disappeared for a century before suddenly reappearing in the Messier 16 Nebula in 921.M30. The world, however, had apparently experienced the accelerated passage of time backwards, going back to the very beginning of humankind's exploration of the void.
Mymeara	Mymeara is an Eldar Craftworld. Its symbol is the Cursing Eye, referencing the omniscient abilities of Asuryan who could kill enemies in a single instant. Mymeara was originally a normal world that had escaped the Fall of the Eldar as its location was on the extreme limits of the Eldar empire and the corrupting influence of pleasure cults had barely reached them. However, in the end, the Mymearans descended into the depravity and madness of their race. The wisest of the Craftworld's elders had foreseen this fate and spent the last decades constructing a mighty Craftworld. The world-ship was completed as the world began to descend into wholesale bloodshed and slaughter, and only half of Mymeara's original population was on board when the Craftworld set sail. Lost in their grief for the death of their race and believing themselves alone in the galaxy, the Craftworld drifted through the stars for many years. However, their assumptions were soon proven wrong and the Craftworld had to fight for its very survival against Orks. Hundreds of thousands of Mymearans died in these wars, and the only hope for Mymeara during this time came from Irillyth, the Phoenix Lord of the Shadow Spectres. Through his wisdom, the warriors of Mymeara learned how to combine the aspects of stealth, speed, and firepower to decimate their foes and soon set about clearing a safe path through the galaxy for their world-vessel.
Dreer	Dreer is an Imperial Feral World.
Beta-Garmon III	Beta-Garmon III is a world of the Beta-Garmon Star Cluster. The most heavily populated world of the Beta-Garmon Star Cluster, the planet is soaked in an endless toxic maelstrom. The largest Hive on the planet is Caldera Primus, its spires hanging over a boiling chemical geyser and protected by a web of heavily fortified drawbridges. Its wealth comes from storm-sail miners and hive industries. However, the most vital asset of the planet is the Carthega Telepathica or Diviner's Needle, an enormous Astropathic temple which nearly breaches Beta-Garmon III's atmosphere. The temple serves as the primary communications hub for the Beta-Garmon Star Cluster. During the Horus Heresy, the world was the site of heavily fighting in the massive Battle of Beta-Garmon. These included the loyalists of the Legio Solaria and Legio Defensor clashing with the Legio Fureans and vast hordes of traitor Imperial Army. However, at the height of the battle it became apparent that instead of Beta-Garmon II, Beta-Garmon III was the true target of Horus' offensive and he assailed the world with the might of the Sons of Horus as well as 100 Titan's of the Legio Mortis. During the fighting the Carthega Telepathica collapsed, decimating Imperial forces.

Its first unique Battleship design was the Annihilator Class.
Waaagh! Garaghak	Waaagh Garaghak! is an infamous Ork Waaagh! that has all but captured the Imperial Forsarr Sector. It is often used by the Schola Progenium as a typical example of how a Waaagh! grows. Beginning as a small Goff warband, it now comprises numerous Ork Tribes and Warbands and many Ork leaders from various Clans, including the infamous Mek-Boss Buzzgob and Zhadsnark of Evil Sunz. It is currently believed to be capturing the last worlds in the sector and preparing to besiege the Raven Guard homeworld of Deliverance. The following is a list of major events during the campaign:
Carandinis VII	Carandinis VII had billions of its population turned into Plaguebearers by Typhus, when he unleashed Nurgle's Rot onto the planet.
Drusus Shrine World	Also known as Sentinel, this planet stands at the rimward limits of the sector and is dedicated as a holy Shrine World to Saint Drusus.[1a][1b] An elementally poor world, dominated by bleak dust bowls and salt-deserts, it supports, thanks to the Chartist ships, a population of pilgrims who maintain the Shrine: a five thousand metre tall structure of ouslite and rockcrete located in the southern hemisphere. The Shrine is the only significant artificial structure on the planet. There, high up in the draughty reaches of weathered stone, burns the eternal flame of Drusus, ministered to by the flocks of pilgrims, most of whom come to Sentinel to die.[1b] The standard of living is low on this bleak world and there is no system of government or order apart from the rubrics of the Imperial Creed. Outside the Shrine - "beyond the shadow" as local slang has it - life is a fringe existence, to say the least. Endless, waterless deserts of dust and calcification stretch out to the very edges of the planet. Jettison collectors and scavengers may be found in the vast salt-licks but they are transient. A well-supplied man might last twenty days in the barrens of this harsh world.[1b]
Kovalic II	Kovalic II is an Imperial planet.[1b] Kovalic II is a barren rocky planet on the fringes of the turbulent nebula called The Maelstrom. It was home to a few hundred asteroid miners and several Imperial monitoring station.[1b] The planet was attacked by Dark Eldar, which used unknown Eldar type flyers.[1a] When a relief force of the Red Talons Space Marine Chapter arrived to help they found no survivors. Of those that resisted, the slain was grotesquely displayed as mutilated bodies. The inhabitants were all disappeared and were never found.[1b]
Amarah Prime	Amarah Prime is an Imperium planet. It is the capital planet of the Orpheus Sector. During the Orphean War, the key Battle of Amarah devastated the planet. Though the Necron attack was eventually stemmed, the small amounts of surviving Imperial forces stationed on the world were quickly evacuated while the remaining civilian population was abandoned to their own fate.
Khur	Khur, originally known as Forty-Seven Ten, was a world of the Imperium. Brought into compliance by the Word Bearers during the Great Crusade, it was the home to Monarchia, the Legion's "Perfect City".

Afterwards, Calgar's high-ranking enemies within the Imperium engineered the now infamous Court of Inquiry into the Chapter Master's actions during the suppression of the uprising. However, Calgar was later, quite rightly, exonerated of all charges.

Fortis Binary	Fortis Binary is a Forge World in the Sabbat Worlds cluster that fell to Chaos. During the Sabbat Worlds Crusade, the Tanith First and Only regiment was ordered to make a suicidal frontal attack on the enemy trench line. The order came from Lord Militant General Hechtor Dravere, the theatre commander, at the suggestion of Colonel Draker Flense of the Jantine Patricians, who harboured a deep personal hatred for the Tanith's commanding officer, Colonel-Commissar Ibram Gaunt.[1a] Imperial Guardsmen fought with Chaos forces across four hundred kilometres of battlefield, a vast and ragged pat­tern of opposing trench systems, facing each other across a mangled dead-land of cratered mud and shattered factories.[1a] However, the Ghosts managed to sabotage a Chaos ritual to turn the attacking guardsmen into Daemonhosts.[1b]
Antioch Majoris	Antioch Majoris was home to a group of Hereteks during the Horus Heresy.
Croatoa	Croatoa is an Imperial Death World. Unusually, the planet itself appears to be a living organism.
Artificial World	An Artificial World is a classification given to the Imperium's many orbital stations, asteroidal emplacements and other constructed facilities. These range from listening posts and research laboratories, to military space stations and doomsday bastions.
Harakoni Warhawks	The Harakoni Warhawks are an Imperial Guard Drop Regiment from the planet Harakon. Skills learned by the Harakoni using grav-gliders for transport and to hunt Vapourwyrms on their native homeworld translates to a fearlessness of altitude and expertise at judging air currents, knowledge necessary for their role as drop troops.[1b] The Harakoni are a highly-mobile force thanks to their use of grav-chutes to deploy from orbit wherever they are needed. They are notable for utilising the assistance of Tempestus Scions, as well as maintaining a large number of Heavy Weapons Platoons and Special Weapons Squads.[1b] Besides Elysians, they are one of the rare troops that can land from Valkyries using grav-chute descents.
Sepharis Ultra	Sepharis Ultra is a world of the Imperium. The world was the site of the destruction of the Lords of Desolation warband. As the warband attacked the planet, they were caught by surprise as Black Templars drop pods landed amongst them. In the ensuing battle the warband's leader, Word Bearer Sorcerer X’hal Urus was killed by the Black Templars Emperor's Champion Reinhart. With his death, the daemons allied with the Word Bearer were sent back to the warp, allowing the Black Templars to destroy the Lords of Desolation.

He once held the rank of Librarian in his Legion during the Great Crusade, before he joined his brothers in renouncing the Emperor and dedicated himself to the Chaos God Nurgle during the Horus Heresy. Despite this, after nearly 10,000 years in the service of Grandfather Nurgle, Porphyricus has barely received any favour from his patron. Frustrated and dismayed by this lack of recognition, Porphyricus has resorted to ever-more depraved ways to draw the attention of the Great Corruptor. Among the atrocities he has committed was the creation of a sorcerous plague that infected just one person at a time on the Imperial world of Castix VIII. When the Guardsman who was first infected died, the company medics thought the plague was gone, only to find someone else had been infected the next day. These peaks and troughs of hope and despair were Porphyricus's gift to Nurgle, but they went unnoticed. He then ruined an Agri World, during the Goanic Crisis, with just a single sorcerous conjuration. This also failed to gain him notice, so in the Battle of Withering Breach he reduced an entire Ork horde to mutated fungal spores. His actions left the world the Orks were on to rot, but he was still not rewarded. However, unknown to Porphyricus, Grandfather Nurgle knows of the Sorcerer's efforts and enjoys his servant's despair.
Delta Tao	Delta Tao is an Imperium world located in Ultima Segmentum.[1a] Immolan, the Planetary Governor of Delta Tao, had grown lax in his rule of the world, leading to large-scale desertion in its Planetary Defence Forces and to large caches of supplies and ammunition being reported as missing. This led Inquisitor Masada to suspect that Immolan was building a private army and he dispatched three investigative expeditions to Delta Tao, leading the last one himself, but all three were never heard from again. Since then, no Imperial forces have been able to make contact with Delta Tao due to heavy warp activity;[1b] as a result, by 992.M41 the world had been declared perdita. It was later discovered that Delta Tao had been invaded by Hive Fleet Kraken, in 992.M41, though its current fate is unknown.
Avalorn	Avalorn was brought into Compliance with the Imperium by the Alpha Legion and Imperial Fists Legions during the Great Crusade.

Gharex V	Gharex V is an Imperium world whose Imperial Guard garrison was massacred in a horrific fashion by the Harlequin Masque of the Reaper's Mirth.
Elysiar	Elysiar is the fourth planet of the Modren's Realm System. On a first glance Elysiar is a verdant, prosperous and paradise world – ideal for colonization. In truth, though, there are many dangers, from microscopic parasites to toxic plants and carnivorous arthropods. The ancient xenos ruins contains many traps and autonomous sentries. Although Elysiar can not be classified as a Death World, it has proven a constant danger to settlers.

Death World	A δτ-class or Death World (sometimes spelled as Deathworld) is a world classification defined by its extremely dangerous or aggressive native flora and fauna. These eco-systems are finely balanced between continual destruction and lightning-fast reproduction. Death worlds take many forms, ranging from jungle-covered hell-holes with carnivorous plants and animals to barren, volcanic wastelands racked by ion storms. The most famous and notorious Death World is the hellish planet of Catachan Some worlds can be turned into Death Worlds, like what occurred on Indiga after numerous captive giant predators escaped from their zoos. When this happens, these worlds are labeled as Man-Made Death Worlds. Humans can, and do, live on these worlds, but it is a never-ending struggle. On many death worlds it is as if the entire bio-mass of the planet were consciously motivated against human settlement - concentrating forces against intruders to destroy them. Death worlds with human settlements or colonies can have populations of 1,000 to 15,000,000.
Zarghan Ironfist	Zarghan Ironfist was a Chaos Champion of Slaanesh and renegade from the Emperor's Children Legion, from which he was expelled after raiding the palace of his former captain, Vilius, and crucifying his pleasure slaves.[1a] After these events, Zarghast found himself following the Daemon Prince Shaha Gaathon, and leading a warband of mutants and abhumans.[Needs Citation] Zarghan's 'fleet' consisted of the Iconoclast Destroyer Pride of Sin, which was defeated above the Crone World of Belial IV in the Eye of Terror by the Star of Venam.[1b] This article needs work on its citations.For help on citation see the citation guidelines.

Sarosel	Sarosel was the world to be brought back under Imperial rule by the Luna Wolves under the command of Warmaster Horus during the Great Crusade. Compliance was accepted by the inhabitants of the planet by their sheer will and unconditionally. Immediately after joining the Imperium citizens held a grand carnival of celebration that lasted eight weeks. The dancers on the streets wore big hats of paper, cane and ribbon - great constructions each resembling some gaudy form: a dragon, a sun, a ship etc. It was such an odd sight that it made laughter not only the many of the Luna Wolves, but even Horus himself.
Dulan	Dulan was the throneworld of the Faash during the Great Crusade, until it was captured by the Imperium at the end of the Dulan Campaign in 870.M30.[3b] Dulan, meaning "Earth" in the local language, was the throneworld of the Dulanian civilisation which spanned a number of other star systems.[3a] It was ruled by the Tyrant Durath, who refused to join the Imperium.[3a] The Space Wolves and Dark Angels launched a joint assault on Dulan at the end of the Dulan Campaign. Lion El'Jonson executed the Tyrant in his throne room, angering Leman Russ who then struck his brother.[3b] The infamous duel between the Lion and the Wolf led to the tradition that whenever the two Legions (later Chapters) met, they would nominate champions to fight an honour duel. The tradition endures into M41.

Iduno	Iduno is an Imperial world where, in 567.M40, then-Sergeant Darnath Lysander commanding a unit of the 2nd Company of the Imperial Fists was victorious over a group of heretics at the Battle of Colonial Bridge.

Sabbat Martyr	Sabbat Martyr is the seventh novel in the Gaunt's Ghosts series by Dan Abnett. With the future of the Sabbat Worlds campaign balanced on a knife edge, new hope arises in the form of Saint Sabbat herself, reincarnated to lead the Imperium to victory against the dark forces of Chaos. The living saint calls for Colonel-Commissar Gaunt and the Tanith First to be her guardians. Doubting that she is who she claims, Gaunt must discover the truth while fending off enemy troops and lethal assassins. But treachery within the Ghosts will not only threaten the mission, but will rip the Tanith asunder. At the request of the reincarnated Saint Sabbat, the Tanith First-and-Only is summoned to the remote and tactically insignificant world Herodor. The Civitas Beati, a holy city dedicated to the Saint, is under assault from a legion of Blood Pact, led by Enok Innokenti. While the Ghosts prepare to defend the city alongside the local PDF force, Gaunt learns the truth of the situation: the woman posing as the reincarnated Saint is Sanian, an esholi whom the Ghosts encountered on Hagia. Utterly convinced that she is Sabbat, Sanian has clearly lost her mind. Lord-General Lugo - whose career has been unstable since his disgrace at Hagia - plans to use her as propaganda, and does not care that she is an imposter; he believes that he will be forever remembered as the man responsible for a miracle in the Sabbat Worlds. As far as untold thousands of pilgrims, Imperial and archenemy troops are concerned, Sanian is the true Saint.

From the depths of a crumbling cathedral come bloodied nightmares, intent on fulfilling their dark purpose by any means necessary. Only one thing stands in their way: the wrathful, holy fire of the Adepta Sororitas. Filled with the light of the Emperor, Sister Superior Augusta and her squad are a force to be reckoned with. They are here to purge the darkness from Lautis with prayer and bolter, and nothing will stop them. But the things that dwell in the darkness aren’t afraid. Augusta must put her trust in her Battle Sisters and lead them into the shadows of the crypts in search of the truth. Faith and fire are powerful weapons, but will they be enough to defeat the sinister powers that lurk in the deeps?
Bastion (Planet)	Bastion was a heavily militarized planet that retained its neutrality in the early days of the Horus Heresy. Bastion's surface was occupied by nine continents, whose landscapes included ice-plains, desert flatlands, and mountain ranges. Beneath these, its inhabitants had built shielded hubs to stockpile the planet's naturally occurring geothermal nuclear energy. Contacted by the Iron Warriors, Bastion willingly complied to the Imperium's expansion, and hosted a contingent of the IV Legion until shortly before the Horus Heresy. Each of its nine continents was ruled by a political center known as a clave, and the prime-clave Cullis was its de facto capital.
Chondax System	The Chondax System is a large System of Imperial space. During the Horus Heresy, the region was heavily infested by Orks and was chosen by the treacherous Warmaster Horus as the location to dispatch Jaghatai Khan and his White Scars. Due to its layout, it would take The Khan a lifetime of fighting to clear the System of Orks while he could meanwhile initiate his rebellion against the Emperor. After the lengthy Chondax Campaign, the White Scars were largely successful in defeating most of the Greenskins but escaped the System after receiving word of the Burning of Prospero. To escape, the White Scars had to break through a Alpha Legion blockade.
Agripinaa	Agripinaa is a Forge World located close to the Eye of Terror and is the principal supplier of arms to the entire Cadian Gate region. It is known as the Orb of a Thousand Scars.[6b] Agripinaa exists upon the threshold of the Eye of Terror. Were it not for the defences of the Cadian System, it would have fallen long ago. The planet's technological bounty has led many Warpsmiths of Chaos to raid the planet, including several full-scale invasions. This has left its surface with a battered and scarred appearance, its atmosphere toxic to human life, forcing the population of 80 million industrial slaves to live in sealed hives. In exchange for protection, Agripinaa provided the Cadian System with most of its armaments as well as supplementing them with Skitarii forces.[6b] Agripinaa does not sit solely on the defensive, however. They have a history of dispatching war fleets into the Eye of Terror to crush Forge Worlds of the Dark Mechanicus. One notable campaign was against the Dark Forge of Temporia.
Third Sphere of Expansion	The Third Sphere of Expansion, launched in 997.M41, was the third campaign of expansion of the Tau Empire. Launched in the aftermath of the Great War of Confederation, the campaign was overseen by Commander Shadowsun. With the Orks defeated in the Great War of Confederation, Ethereal Supreme Aun'va knew the time was ripe for a new phase of expansion. The great war against the Orks had pushed Tau civilization to a setting of total war, and they now could support campaigns larger then any before. The large and newly experienced caste of Fire Warriors would be bolstered with improved ship engines and stasis chambers, allowing for expeditions to be launched over much greater distances. Thus unlike past spheres of expansion which focused on specific star clusters, the Third Sphere encompassed a much larger region of space. The expedition under Commander Shadowsun first crossed the Damocles Gulf and moved into Imperial space. Thanks to Water Caste agents, Gue'vesa humans were mobilized to conduct reconnaissance against Imperial forces. Some Imperial worlds simply surrendered at the first sight of the Tau, welcoming the Water Caste ambassadors and pledging for their cooperation. However most humans rejected Tau overtures due to their distrust of all xenos and Shadowsun and her armies were forced to sweep down in a series of precision strikes. The sparsely deployed imperial defenders proved unable to stem the Tau advance. Soon the northernmost sector of the Damocles Gulf was in Tau hands while the Galactic West was cleared of Hrud, Orks, and rebel humans. New Septs established during the Third Sphere of Expansion include Ksi'm'yen, Mu'gulath Bay, and Fi'rios.
Endymion Prime (Death World)	Endymion Prime is a Death World visited by Koulick Krieg.
Saim-Hann	"Hear me, my kinsfolk! We have sworn the knife-pledge, we have eaten the fruit of the kybald, we have painted our faces red with the blood of the slain. There is naught left to do now but ride."-Alaril Adderi, Chieftan of the Vorp-adders Wild Host[10b] Saim-Hann is an Eldar Craftworld with a reputation for wildness and a preference for lightning-fast attacks. Saim-Hann (literally, "Quest for Enlightenment") is regarded by other Craftworlds as anything from a slightly wild and dangerous place to a nest of barbarians living on the edge of Eldar society. They have developed the Path of the Eldar in a much more flexible way than other Eldar. On Saim-Hann, the Path is still a form of control over Eldar life, but it allows Eldar to experience the more wild and carefree ways of old. This practice is regarded by other Eldar as being dangerous, as it was just those sorts of feelings and experiences that led to the Fall of the Eldar. It is said that Saim-Hann was one of the first Craftworlds to escape the Eldar homeworlds before the birth of Slaanesh. It still maintains many links with the somewhat primitive Exodites.[Needs Citation]
Desert World	Desert worlds are desolate planets with no bodies of water and with completely desert terrains. Since "desert world" only refers to the planet's terrain, most human-populated desert worlds fall into a technical Imperial class, such as civilised world, feral world or death world[Needs Citation]. As a result of their harsh environments, the inhabitants of desert worlds are prudent and cautious people. They take care of their precious resources and only strike out at their enemies when the moment is right. They are also excellent guerrilla fighters, as their skills at hiding in featureless deserts make them superlative scouts and deadly ambushers. Generally, the planets are desert worlds when they are colonised, but in some extreme cases such as virus bombing, a formerly habitable planet had its ecosystem completely destroyed, leading to planetwide desertification. This was the case on Tallarn after it was bombarded by the Iron Warriors.[Needs Citation] There are currently thousands of Desert Worlds within the Imperium.
Periclitor	Periclitor the Foresworn is a Daemon Prince of Chaos. In his days as a Chaos Lord of the Word Bearers Legion, he earned the eternal enmity of the Howling Griffons Chapter. Periclitor was a Chaos Lord of the Word Bearers whose rise to daemonhood began with the Castile V massacre in 832.M33. There, he sealed a pact with the powers of the warp by sacrificing a thousand souls, among them missionaries of the Ecclesiarchy and members of the Adepta Sororitas. In 888.M33, he martyred Saint Jerome after eviscerating each of his followers before his eyes. By bribery and sedition he orchestrated the unwitting sacrifice of a hundred thousand souls in the Alcmena Nebula wars of 012.M34, and in 739.M35 he wiped out the 5th Armoured Terran Praefects. He even bested a force of Grey Knights when he led an army to breach the Sentry Vault on Urus Prime.
Battle of Cardrim	The Battle of Cardrim was a three-way conflict in 925.M41 between the White Scars Space Marines, an Ork Waaagh! under Warboss Skullkrumpa, and the Necron Nihilakh Dynasty. After breaking off from Waaagh! Grax, Warboss Skullkrumpa's first target was the Imperial world of Cardrim for no other reason than it was the closest nearby world. Though a barren and lightly populated world, it was a key staging area in the defense of the Forge World Ryza from another Ork horde under Grax himself. When it came under attack, the White Scars 4th Company under Joghaten Khan was the first to respond. Within moments of entering orbit, Joghaten's Strike Cruiser launched a wing of Thunderhawks and Stormtalons. Initially quietly descending into the atmosphere, the White Scars aircraft soon came under attack from a swarm of Ork aircraft under Skullkrumpa's right-hand Ork Da Krimson Barun. Da Krimson Baron, piloting a Dakkajet, ripped through the Space Marine Stormtalons and a vicious aerial battle erupted which forced one Thunderhawk, the White Crow, to make an emergency landing. Joghaten ordered his remaining Thunderhawk to continue on target. Upon crashing, the White Crow was immediately assailed by bands of Ork Speed Freaks on the ground but were given covering fire from Stormtalons. As the White Scars were evacuating the downed craft, a lone Ork jet, laden with bombs, plowed directly into the White Crow, blowing it to pieces. The explosion killed many of the White Scars as well as destroying the overhead Stormtalons. Nonetheless, the surviving White Scars dug themselves in and prepared to meet the incoming Ork horde.
Boreal V	Boreal V is a world of the galaxy. A Space Wolves strike force once fought against blood-cultists here.
Sparme	Sparme is a world of the Imperium. The Iron Hands destroyed an Sheed xeno infestation on the planet.
Necron Lord	Necron Lords are leaders of Necron armies that serve under Overlords and rule over individual Tomb Worlds. Taking orders from their Overlord, Necron Lords direct battles and oversee the functions of the Tomb World as part of the Royal Court. Often seen wearing crumbling vestments and wielding ancient and arcane staffs, they are a chilling sight on the battlefield, filling their foes with dread. Though age mars and chips at their once-perfectly silvered forms, time has not diminished their malice. To further unnerve the enemy, they direct their forces to attack in eerie silence and have glittering arcs of energy surrounding the soulless fires that burn in their empty eye sockets. The basic armament for a Necron Lord is a Staff of Light, but this is sometimes upgraded to a Warscythe, Hyperphase Sword, or Voidblade. Necron Lords are also known to go into battle with Resurrection Orbs.
Venomhead	The Venomhead is an Ork Clan, whose symbol is a yellow three headed serpent that is coiled on a field of black. A large warhost from the Clan is currently invading Danik's World, which had rebelled against the Imperium before the Venomhead's arrival. As a result, the warhost is not only fighting against the rebels, but also the Vostroyan Firstborn's Twelfth Army, which had been sent to end the world's rebellion.
Qietto	Qietto was the site of a battle between Orks and the Vostroyan 68th Firstborn Regiment.
Ithaka	Ithaka (also called the Cradle of Snakes) is an Ocean World and the homeworld of the Iron Snakes Space Marines Chapter.[1a] The chapter's Fortress-monastery occupies Ithaka's orbiting moon of Karybdis.[1b] Though primarily oceanic, Ithaka does, however, possess significant landmass, including tropical islands[1c] and viciously cold polar regions.[1d] The water from its oceans is considered sacred, and is carried by the Chapter to anoint every planet that they step foot on, in what is called the Rite of the Giving of Water.[1e] When those marines return home, what remains is given back to Ithaka.[1f]
Ulthwe	Ulthwé (full name Ulthanesh Shelwé or Ulthanash Shelwé, meaning the Song of Ulthanash)[4a] is one of the largest and most populous Eldar craftworlds remaining since the Fall of the Eldar. Well over five million years before M41, Farseer Lsathranil of Ulthwé created Lsathranil's Shield to contain the Necrons on the planet Rahe's Paradise, along with the prophecy Ishandruir that foresaw their return. Ulthwé was caught in the gravitational pull of the Eye of Terror when it formed during the birth of Slaanesh and now orbits it, perilously close to ultimate absorption and under regular attack from the denizens of the Eye of Terror. Being so near the Eye, the Craftworld has fought long and bitterly against Chaos forces. Areas within the Craftworld lie in ruins from battles fought within Ulthwé itself between Eldar and Chaos raiders. The location of Ulthwé is the reason given by Ulthwé for maintaining such a large number of Warlocks, while others believe it more due to be their location causing exaggerated psychic powers in the Ulthwé population that causes the emergence of more Warlocks. Whatever the reason, many Warlocks and other psychic warriors follow the Ulthwé armies to battle and their skills are even more advanced than other Craftworlds, being able to see further ahead in time and with greater precision.[Needs Citation]
Adeptus Arbites	The Adeptus Arbites are the police force of the Adeptus Terra, devoted to enforcing Imperial law throughout the entire Imperium. Utterly dedicated and without mercy, the Arbites are feared throughout the galaxy, for they are the agents of a harsh law, where failure and incompetence are crimes, and the only punishment is death. Arbites are empowered to act as judge, jury and executioner – citizens have no rights, and only members of the Priesthood of Terra or the Inquisition could claim anything so elaborate as a trial. The Adeptus Arbites date from at least the Great Crusade, when compliant worlds had Lord Marshal's Offices installed to deal with 'non-local' matters. During the Horus Heresy, the Grand Provost Marshal of the Arbites was part of the War Council. During the War of the Beast, the significant Arbites garrison on Terra saw heavy action against the Ork Attack Moon over the Throneworld. The Arbites took catastrophic losses in the failed Proletarian Crusade, and its surviving Terran contingent struggled to maintain order on Terra as upheavals caused by the Greenskin presence broke out.
Idumea	Idumea is a Forge World in the Calixis Sector. Many of its ruling caste are now part of the Phaenonite conspiracy. The Forge World houses secret facilities for them to use, as well as providing an almost unending supply of manpower.
Forest World	Forest Worlds are the worlds with the dense forests all across the planet's surface. They have not such aggressive wildlife as a Jungle Worlds and during wars become the perfect hunting grounds for elite guerilla forces.
Milarro	Milarro is a world controlled by the Word Bearers, who have converted nearby asteroids into seminaries.
Arkunasha	Arkunasha is a Tau Empire colony settled in the Second Sphere of Expansion. An arid world, the Tau have nonetheless managed to make a sizeable population thanks to the Earth Caste's construction of a string of bio-dome cities in the planet's temperate bands. This gives the planet a distinct look from space: a blood-red globe with two glowing blue-white bands above and below the equator. While surveying the planet ahead of colonization, the Earth Caste examined the oxide deserts that dominate Arkunasha and came to the conclusion that they were the remnants of an incredibly ancient civilization, whose world-spanning, mountain-sized cities had long crumbled to rust.
New Klondike	New Klondike is an Imperium world with rough terrain and low native fuel resources. Because of this, the horse is a more practical form of transportation than a motorized vehicle.
Ancarin	Ancarin is the second world of the Inwit Cluster.
Chosin	The fifth world in the Armageddon system, Chosin is an Ice World of erratic orbit. Chosin was of limited interest to the Imperium, due to the difficulty in colonising it and the poor range of resources present on the planet; the defenders of the Armageddon system nevertheless fought for it during the Second War for Armageddon. Small tribes of Feral Orks landed on the planet and presented a danger. They were hunted down and thought exterminated by Imperial forces such as the Armageddon Ork Hunters. However, during the Third War for Armageddon, when Orks once again landed on Chosin, their numbers swelled so rapidly that Imperial tacticians questioned whether they had really managed to wipe out the Feral Orks at all. The Orks spread all over the planet, infesting it completely and putting its reclamation by Imperial forces in doubt. Somewhat symbolically, the main Imperial military base on Chosin has become the foundation site of the Ork capital settlement.
Leviathan (Box)	Leviathan is a limited-run starter set produced for the launch of the 10th Edition of Warhammer 40,000. Warhammer 40,000: Leviathan comes complete with two powerful armies of spectacular new miniatures, pitting a force of mighty Space Marines against an unending xenos swarm of Tyranids against the backdrop of the Fourth Tyrannic War Terminators
Arthas Moloch	Arthas Moloch is an Artefact World. It shares the same system with the Ork World of Dregrokk. The Artifact World of Arthas Moloch is a desolate one, filled with strange, faceless statues that predate the Imperium. At some point after the Horus Heresy, Arthas Moloch became a base to the Alpha Legion and settled by a large population of humans and mutants belonging to Chaos Cults. In M39, the Scythes of the Emperor purged the entire planet, leaving Arthas Moloch completely uninhabited. The world's ruins and tombs, however, still bear the dark brown smears of bloodshed and the images of shadows burnt into the walls. If one were psychic, they would see the planet shine like a gold mine in a firelight. O'Shovah visited this world while clearing Tau Space of Orks during the Farsight Expedition of the Tau Empire. In the ruins of a mysterious dais, Farsight and his forces fought off unknown forces that were likely Chaos Daemons. During this battle, all of Farsight's Ethereals were killed, and Farsight took up a mysterious weapon known as the Dawn Blade to defeat the creatures and the portal they emerged from. After the battle, O'Shovah and the Tau force left the world and later founded the Farsight Enclaves.
Dantris III	Dantris III is a Forge World on the Eastern Fringe.[Help] During the Second Tyrannic War, Dantris III was attacked by the Tyranids of Hive Fleet Kraken. A key experiment was carried out during the defence of this world: a few companies of the Lostock 23rd regiment were surgically modified by the Magos Biologis with drug-secreting glands. These allowed the guardsmen so modified to better resist the effects of the Hive Mind and the modifications made to the planet's biosphere by the Tyranids. Dantris III was eventually scoured of the Tyranid menace, although the Lostock 23rd was utterly destroyed in the defence (only three so-called "Gland Warriors" are believed to have survived).

42 Hydra Tertius	42 Hydra Tertius, known as Eolith to the Cabal, is a world that became home to a Cabal facility in roughly 60,000 B.C.[1c] Several years before the end of the Horus Heresy, the planet became the meeting ground between the Cabal and Alpharius Omegon, Primarch of the Alpha Legion. After being given a revelation that mankind would only be destroyed unless Horus were to emerge victorious in his coming rebellion.[1a]
Lukius	Lukius is a War World of the Severan Dominate, located in The Periphery in the Calixis Sector. Lukius represents the boundary across which Severus has sworn the Orks will not advance. It serves as the primary battleground in the Dominate’s war against Waaagh! Grimtoof, absorbing the bulk of its military focus and resources. Lukius lies on a critical trunk of the Calixis-Scarus Warp conduit, situated beyond the main reach of the Imperium’s conventional military forces. Its remote location renders it largely unknown to even the higher echelons of the Imperium’s command. The human population of Lukius lived as primitive, tribal societies for millennia. With the rise of the Severan Dominate, these inhabitants were forcibly conscripted into service. Once iron-age barbarian tribes, they have been rapidly and brutally integrated into the Dominate’s military structure.
Chaoku-Minor	Chaoku-Minor is an Imperium world.
Flak (World)	Flak is a world that has constant rainfall.
Crowe's World	Crowe's World[1a] is a planet about a thousand light-years from Medusa, near the Draconic Arm.[1b] In M41, Orks attacked Crowe's World. The corrupt Planetary Governor attempted to flee, taking with him a chest containing all the revenues of the treasury, but died when his aircar crashed in the planet's jungle. The Planetary Militia's officers were killed, so Janus Darke rallied the troops, and then led the defence during the Siege of Crowe's Town that followed, until the Blood Angels arrived and broke the siege.[1b] Crowe's World has a steaming jungle,[1b] and peat-swamps that look stable under your feet, but turn out to have the consistency of jelly, and paths that shift in the slow swirl of currents.[1c] Hunters staked out Goats on the edge of swamps where Dragons lived, hoping to lure them onto killing ground.[1d]
Epic Swordwind	Epic Swordwind is an expansion to Epic Armageddon. Published in 2005, it concentrated primarily on the armed forces of the Baran Siegemasters (a siege regiment of the Imperial Guard from the world Baran), Biel-tan Eldar and Feral Orks of Warboss Snagga-snagga. It was free to download from the Games Workshop website. http://web.archive.org/web/20101123004839/http://www.games-workshop.com/MEDIA_CustomProductCatalog/m1320010_Swordwind_Part_3_-_Baran_War.pdf
The War on Dellerax	The War on Dellerax was a two year armoured campaign, on the remote Imperium world Dellerax, between Cadian Imperial Guard Regiments, led by Commander Pask, and the Eldar of Craftworld Saim-Hann, led by the legendary Chieftain Fell Winter.[1c] Listed here are a few of the events during the campaign, which led to the destruction of hundreds of tanks on both sides[1a]: 121859.M41 — A fierce storm engulfed the Iron Storm Desert on Dellerax and Imperial Guard Recon troops discovered a Xeno structure at the eye of the storm, unearthed by the shifting sands. All contact was lost with the Recon troops mere moments after they report their findings.[1a]
Andronicus Prime	Andronicus Prime is a Dead World in the Jericho Reach. It was once an Imperial Forest World, until a vast city-sized vessel of unknown origin hurtled out of the Warp at great speed and crashed into Andronicus Prime’s second moon. The impact shattered it and the resulting debris rained down on the world, blotting out its sun and laying waste to Andronicus Prime's verdant forests. In a matter of days all life on the world was exterminated. Sometime later, however, the forces of the Tau Empire's Sa'cea Sept, have now invaded the ruined world.
Convent Sanctorum	The Convent Sanctorum is one of the two primary convents of the Adepta Sororitas and is located on Ophelia VII, the other being the Convent Prioris on Terra.[3b][4a] The convent was formed during Ecclesiarch Sebastian Thor's reformation of the Adeptus Ministorum, following the transformation of the remaining 4,000 Daughters of the Emperor into the Adepta Sororitas.[3b] The Adepta were split between Terra and Ophelia VII into the Convent Prioris and Convent Sanctorum, similar to the splitting of the Holy Synod and Synod Ministra to those same planets, respectively.[3b] Following the Adepta Sororitas growing to over 10,000, Ecclesiarch Alexis XXII, Thor's successor, further split the Orders Militant of the Convent Sanctorum into the Order of the Valorous Heart and the Order of the Fiery Heart, the latter of which was renamed to the Order of Our Martyred Lady following the death of their founder Saint Katherine Elysius.[3b] In M38, Ecclesiarch Deacis VI created the Order of the Bloody Rose, founded in honor of Mina, champion of Saint Alicia Dominica.[3b] The Convent Sanctorum is a large fortress that acts as the religious, administrative, and military heart for each order headquartered there, with cloisters so winding that even its overseers fully don't know the goings on of its chambers.[4a][4b] In M38, Ecclesiarch Deacis VI expanded the Convent Sanctorum to accommodate 15,000 warriors each and has since grown to accommodate tens of thousands.[3b][4a]
Tassilon	Tassilon is the world where during the Great Crusade, the Luna Wolves encountered and fought against the warp entities.
Seraphina	Seraphina is a planet that was cleansed of Orks in the Space Wolves Legion's Wheel of Fire Campaign during the Great Crusade. It was also where the Primarch Leman Russ was given the Dionysian Spear for his Legion's successful completion of their campaign.

Corossa	Corossa is an Imperium world that was brought into Compliance by the Word Bearers Legion during the Great Crusade. After the Word Bearers moved on, Chapter Master Kor Phaeron remained behind to begin the population of Corossa's education into the Imperial Truth. However, he secretly allowed elements of the population's culture that reminded him of the Old Faith of his Homeworld, Colchis, to remain.
Caer Malafori	Caer Malafori is a planet of the Imperium.
White Dwarf 94 (UK)	White Dwarf 094 UK None
Sans Gaviria	Sans Gaviria is a Death World of the Imperium. While still an Interrogator, Obodiah Roth clashed with a narco-baron on Sans Gaviria. In the aftermath of the conflict, Roth claimed the baron's Tang War-pattern power fist for himself.
Cadamine	Cadamine is an Imperium Forge World that has been invaded by the Leviathan splinter fleet known as the Silent Murder during the Third Tyrannic War. So far, thousands have already been killed in the invasion.
Gehöft	Gehöft is a former Imperial Agri World, that was destroyed by Exterminatus after an attack by the Blighted Claw Warband. The Warband was dedicated to Nurgle and Gehöft was the latest Imperial world, the Blighted Claw had spread a virulent plague upon. The diseases not only destroyed the Gehöft's crops and livestock, but also killed a large number of its population as well. To the horror of the world's defenders, the plague did not simply kill its victims, but turned them into Plague Zombies which turned their eternal hunger upon the Imperials. With the Blighted Claw overpowering Gehöft's defenders and the dead consuming the living, the world was nearly overrun within months of the Blighted Claw's invasion. Despite this bleak outlook, the Astra Militarum's Brindelweld Seventeenth Regiment, as well as the Dark Angels Chapter's Ravenwing came to aid the world against the servants of Nurgle. The White Scars' Master of the Hunt, Kor'sarro Khan, also led his Brotherhood to defend Gehöft, but he knew it was doomed before even setting foot upon it. Instead the Khan came to conclude a Great Hunt against the Blighted Claw's leader, the Plague Lord Paramyx, and put an end to the Warband's infection of numerous worlds of the Imperium. Leading a squadron of attack bikes Kor'sarro pursued Paramyx, as the Imperium and the forces of Nurgle clashed around them, hoping to catch his prey before he left the battle. They were aided in this task by several Ravenwing squadrons led by the Dark Angels Master Sammael and had nearly reached the Plague Lord, when the Khan's squadron was ambushed by a large number of Blight Drones. With their prey getting away, Kor'sarro looked for aid from Sammael's forces, who had been fighting nearby, but he discovered the Ravenwing had abandoned the beleaguered White Scars, to pursue their own mysterious goal on the world. With no aid in sight, the White Scars fought on but soon only Kor'sarro was left alive; with the other White Scars in his squadron laying dead and broken around him. With his squadron gone, the Khan was forced to retreat, which allowed Paramyx to escape and soon afterwards the Imperium's forces were routed. The order to evacuate Gehöft was soon given and an Exterminatus was later launched on the doomed world.
Canoptis II	Canoptis II is an Imperium world that is controlled by the Adeptus Mechanicus and suffered an invasion in the aftermath of the Great Rift's creation. During the invasion, the Adeptus Mechanicus sent out a plea for aid and the garbled message reached Vostroya. Though they were unable to decipher the nature of the foes invading Canoptis II, the Firstborn 22nd ‘Riders of Dawn’, the 99th ‘Only Sons’ and the 331st ‘True Shots’ were sent to aid the embattled world. As they left their Homeworld, the Vostroyan Firstborn regiments could only hope that their Navigators would be able to safely traverse the now lightless stars, to reach Canoptis II.
Britan	Britan is known for raising the Britan Imperial Guard Regiments.
Gaero Alphus	Gaero Alphus was a world of the Imperium that was lost to the forces of Nurgle. In 565.M36, the planet's highly-elliptical orbit brought it closer to its sun and the colonies experienced severe drought. The planet's industrial base dwindled as malnutrition rose; eventually, the colonists had consumed all animal life. The heat drove the tribesmen to pray for divine aid, descending into primitive rain-dances and even human sacrifice. Nurgle eventually took pity on the world and gave it rain. The rain came without end and each day saw the clouds grow thicker and darker. Deserts became lakes and farms became swamps. Endless rainwater flooded towns and those who didn't drown faced waterborne disease. Eight days later, the Tallyman of Nurgle Epidemius rose from the muck to catalogue the disaster: he found the planetary population devastated from malnutrition and disease. The surviving tribes took flight from his hordes of Plaguebearers, while those who fought were too weak and were overcome.
Plague Wars	"‘Let them flee beneath cover of their virus bomb. By the Emperor, they shall be repaid tenfold for the evils they have wrought upon Ultramar.’" War for the Scourge Stars begins The Plague Wars were a series of battles that occurred within the Realm of Ultramar between the forces of the Chaos God Nurgle and the Imperium at the end of the first phase of the Indomitus Crusade.
Battle for Antax	The Battle for Antax was a battle between the Blood Angels and an Ork Waaagh! under Warboss Gutstompa on the Forge World Antax, that occurred in 927.M41. Antax, being a prominent Forge World of the Vidar Sector, was a Loota's dream, packed with heavy weapons and arcane technology. It also supplied hundred of Imperial Guard regiments and a dozen Space Marine Chapters with necessary supplies. As a result, its fall represented a potential disaster for the Imperium. So it was that Captain Donatos Aphael of the Blood Angels turned his strike force towards Antax, despite his Battle-Brothers being exhausted from battles against the Necron World Engine. The battle began when the Battle Barge Blade of Vengeance and its Strike Cruiser escort arrived in orbit of Antax, discovering a vast Adeptus Mechanicus Fleet that had been destroyed by Ork warships in battle. The entirety of the Ork fleet had either been destroyed in the engagement or since landed (which for the Orks, often mean crashed) and as a result the Blood Angels had control of Antax's space. The Blade of Vengeance launched a devastating orbital bombardment which destroyed those Ork vessels which had landed on the group.
88 Tanstar	88 Tanstar is a Frontier World in the Calixis Sector. It is also an Imperial Navy depot.
Fleur-de-Fides	Fleur-de-Fides was a Cardinal World of the Ecclesiarchy. A major hub of the Imperial Creed in Segmentum Solar, it was destroyed during the War of the Beast.
Chandry	Chandry is a Mining World of the Imperium. Five commanderies from the Order of Our Martyred Lady set out to purge the heretical cults which arose on the planet. However they never arrived at their destination, making the Sisters believe it was a sign from the Emperor to subject the planet to exterminatus.
Aghoru	Aghoru, also known as Twenty-Eight Sixteen, was a world brought into the Imperium of Man by units of the Thousand Sons Space Marine Legion during the Great Crusade.[1a] While the compliance action of the world was accomplished by diplomacy and was considered a success, a notable combat between the Thousand Sons and an apparent warp denizen infestation occurred during the process, one that also involved a unit of visiting Space Wolves Astartes. Aghoru, was the fifth planet in a system of otherwise dead worlds.[1a] Discovered by the 28th Expedition Fleet at the height of the Great Crusade, Aghoru proved to be an undeveloped world whose human inhabitants - also known as the Aghoru - had little to no knowledge of science. The human population possessed legends of a previous race of elder beings known to them as the Elohim. The Elohim were believed to be an advanced civilization that possessed an interstellar empire long since destroyed.[1b]
Dimmamar	Dimmamar is an Imperial world in the Segmentum Obscurus. Dimmamar is most famous for two things: being the location where the Confederation of Light was founded[3a], and being the birthplace of Sebastian Thor, who overthrew Goge Vandire and later became Ecclesiarch.[3b][3c] It was also the first planet to defy the will of Vandire and declare him a heretic.[3b] The people of Dimmamar have had past dealings with Fabius Bile, who is known on that planet as "the Chem-master."
Culchare	The planet Culchare was destroyed during the Horus Heresy.
House Althalos	Azazen is a Frontier World of the Imperium. The planet was located at the edge of Wilderness Space, off the main warp conduits for millenia. With the opening of the Great Rift and the beginning of Era Indomitus, the world started to attract criminals, adventurers and xenos using it as a layover before heading into uncharted sectors. The 
Carrion Deep	Carrion Deep is a Necron Tomb World located on the edge of the Veiled Region. It was the site of an Imperial deep-range outpost, which was destroyed in 899.M41 by the Necrons. The ruined outpost was investigated by Space Marines of the Executioners Chapter, who were ambushed by the Necrons but managed to escape. Since then, Carrion Deep has been quarantined by the Imperium.
Henvinka	The planet Henvinka is known for its constant rainfall, which has turned its continents into slurred mulch and its seas into storm-wracked gulfs. During the Great Crusade it was the site of a battle for the Blood Angels and Emperor's Children Legions, who worked together to destroy the enemies of the Imperium that were located on the rain-soaked world.
Carnac	Carnac is a Necron Tomb World. During the Great Sleep it became an Exodite World of the Eldar with a royal family comprising of Mawr and his son Fionn. However in the ensuing Carnac Campaign, the Necrons under Anrakyr the Traveller reclaimed the planet. The planet's World Spirit was later claimed by Trazyn.
Scintilla	Scintilla is the sector capital of the Calixis Sector. The world is governed by Calixis' Sector Governor, currently Marius Hax. It is a thriving Imperial hub that supports the largest planetary population in the territory. It is dominated by two vast hive cities, Hive Sibellus and Hive Tarsus which hold the majority of the planetary population. Despite the dominance of those two hives, the "offspring" communities of Ambulon and Gunmetal City contribute significantly to the planet's economy as well. Scintilla is a world where the powerful and wealthy compete with ruthless appetite. Magnificence is astonishing on Scintilla, from the wondrous fashions of the hive's nobility to the spectacle of the hives themselves. Landmarks like Lucid Palace and the Cathedral of Illumination, are famous throughout the Calixis Sector. It is also a world of corruption where members of noble houses are deluded by their wealth and status and the corruption and privilege runs deep in the culture of the high-born. Noble houses consider themselves (sometimes correctly) as above or outside Imperial law and can wield immense influence. Their attitude towards the lower-born is callous; it is not unknown for thrill-seeking degenerates from noble houses to prey upon lesser humans as a sport.
Chariban Worlds	Chariban Worlds are Imperial worlds, whose mountaintop sanctuaries are laced through with macro fungus farm complexes. The Chariban Worlds were created by the Games Workshop employee Andy Clark and appeared in White Dwarf 481.
Okki	Okki is a world that was held by the Night Lords, during the Great Crusade and Horus Heresy. It was also among the Legion's Fief Worlds, that raised Nostraman Damnatii Solar Auxilia Regiments for the Night Lords.
Jula II	Jula II was a Necron Tomb World, that also contained other Sentient life upon it. These frightened locals prayed for an end to the Necrons and their prayers were answered by the Great Unclean One Rotigus. The Greater Daemon of Nurgle unleashed a omniphagic infestation in response and it consumed the metallic Xenos, much to the celebration of the locals. However Rotigus' plague did not end and soon began consuming them as well.
Eisenfel	Eisenfel is a Chaos-held world that was surrounded by a crushing Warp anomaly some time after the Great Rift's creation. After seeing how the anomaly resembled the giant green fist of their God Gork, several Ork Freebooterz Warbands arrived in their Kroozers to witness their God destroy the world. Instead, they were dragged in by the anomaly's gravitic fluctuations and plunged into a war with Eisenfel's rulers, even as the Warp anomaly slowly crushed the world into rubble and ruin.
Bal'yth's Orb	Bal'yth's Orb was the site of a battle between the Space Wolves and the Eldar, which ended with the Xenos defeated.
Galathas II	Galathas II is an Ice World of the Imperium. Ultramarines Captain Jehnnus Ardias successfully led the Third Company in defending one of Galathas II's cities when the planet was under attack by the Eldar.
Promethean War	Fought in 980.M41, the Promethean War pitted the Sisters of Battle and Salamanders Space Marine Chapter against the Black Legion Chaos Space Marines. Sisters of Battle from the Order of the Ebon Chalice arrived to reinforce the Salamanders in 980.M41, who were already engaged in brutal urban combat against the Black Legion on the world of Heletine. Deploying dozens of Immolators and Land Raider Redeemers, the Chaos forces were put to the torch and the forces of the Imperium burned a path through the war-torn cities of Heletine. Despite the strength of the Imperial forces, the advance was halted when Lord Gralastyx - a Daemon Prince leading the Chaos forces - unleashed a legion of Possessed Chaos Space Marines. As frenzied Chaos hordes ripped through the Imperial ranks, Battle Sisters and Space Marines fought back to back as the situation became hopeless. However the Imperial forces were saved when Saint Celestine appeared and slew Gralastyx personally. With the death of their master, the Chaos Horde was quickly destroyed. But of Celestine there was no sign, for she vanished as mysteriously as she appeared.
Subiaco Diablo	Subiaco Diablo is an Imperial Hive World[1b] and is home to the Convent of the Adepta Sororitas' Order of the Ermine Mantle. In late M41, the Curse of Unbelief began to spread across Subiaco Diablo and many other Segmentum Obscurus worlds, in what many feared was the beginning of another Black Crusade.[1a] They were proven correct as Diablo's dead began rising as Plague Zombies from morgues and the burial grounds outside of all of its Hives. Though slow and ponderous, the undead's sheer weight of numbers overran Diablo's defenders three days later.[1a] Among them were the Order of the Ermine Mantle and many of its Adepta Sororitas died in battle against the Plague Zombies. The Cadian 412th and 616th also fought there and had been assigned to defend Hive Septus, the only Hive the Guardsmen believed to be still fighting against the undead hordes. The defense of the Hive itself was left to the 412th, while the 616th fought the Plague Zombies in the surrounding wasteland outside of Septus. Eventually, though, the undead attacked in such massive numbers that the 616th was completely destroyed, save for one surviving Guardsman who made it back into the Hive.[1a] The Cadian 412th fared little better, as the Curse of Unbelief spread amongst Hive Septus' population and created Plague Zombies. The undead also poured in from the surrounding wasteland and the Hive was soon overrun.[1a] The Cadians were then given the order to evacuate and the remnants of the Cadian 412th and the surviving 616th Guardsman, retreated into Septus' Shuttleport Epsilon to await extraction. As they did so, the Cadians continued to fight the hoards of Plague Zombies, as well as cultists and daemons of Nurgle, who were led by the Plague Marine Korpharact the Contaminated. Just as the port was being overrun, shuttles from Astra Militarum troop ships in orbit, arrived to ferry the 616th Guardsman and the survivors of the 412th to safety.[1b] Sometime later, however, the Plague Zombie hordes were destroyed by the Imperium and Subiaco Diablo was reclaimed.
Maner	Maner is a mist-bound world, that was the site of a battle for the Cadian Shock Troopers.
Signus Tertiary	Signus Tertiary is the second of the seven planets of the Signus Cluster.[1a] Formerly a small Imperial Mining World. It was left quarantined alongside the rest of the system after the campaign was finished.[1b]
Hurspraxia	Hurspraxia is a planet in the Imperium. When the world came under attack from unknown xenos forces, a plea for help was sent to the Departmento Munitorum. However, by the time the request wound its way through the Munitorum's gargantuan bureaucracy, and a response was authorised by a sufficiently senior officer, a full century had passed. The resulting Imperial battle group, consisting of more than a dozen Imperial Guard Regiments from Mordant and Tremert, arrived in the Hurspraxia system to find only a lifeless ball of rock.
Crake's World	Crake's World is a Death World visited by Koulick Krieg.
Modren's Realm	Modren’s Realm (or Modrennia) is a System which belongs to renegade Rogue Trader Vir Modren. Located on the outskirts of the Calixis Sector, Modren's Realm was started by Vir Modren as the foundation of his renegade empire that denies the Imperium, Adeptus Administratum, and the Emperor himself. The system was ruled by a strict feudal system of vassals, serfs, labourers and slaves. The military of Modren's Realm consists mainly of mercenaries, reavers and bandits that obey Vir Modren through a complex system of fear, reverence and greed. Listed in order from the closest to the sun:
Cytheria	Cytheria is a world of the T'au Empire, having been captured during the 3rd Sphere of Expansion from the Imperium in the Cytherian Annexation. Despite being largely pacified and colonized, remaining bands of Catachan Jungle Fighters of the Imperial Guard still wage a guerrilla war on the world.
Framlingham Rifles	The Framlingham Rifles are known to have fought in the Thirteenth Black Crusade.
Chordelis	Chordelis is a Dead World located in the Tarsis Ultra System. Chordelis was mostly given to manufacture, and had orbital dockyards large enough to support battleships and Strike Cruisers. Following the approach of Hive Fleet Leviathan, many people attempted to evacuate Chordelis, with many accidents occurring in the panic.[1b] Sadly, Chordelis was destroyed and the majority of its population were killed, but not by the Tyranids. Inquisitor Lord Kryptman had ordered Exterminatus on Chordelis using virus bombs and the Mortifactors' Strike Cruiser Mortis Probati to prevent Leviathan from absorbing Chordelis' biomass. The large amount of civilian deaths and the fact that Kryptman had lied by stating his intention to make a stand at Chordelis infuriated the Ultramarines, especially Uriel Ventris.[1b]
Nyarr	Nyarr is an Imperial Hive World that was invaded by Necrons during the Thirteenth Black Crusade. However, the Raven Guard Chapter has now come to Nyarr's defense and are relentlessly attacking the Xenos.
Cociaminus	Cociaminus is a planet in the Sabbat Worlds Cluster, which was occupied by the forces of Chaos. Contested between Imperial and Chaos forces during the Sabbat Worlds Crusade, Cociaminus changed hands so many times, and caused such heavy casualties to Warmaster Slaydo's Crusade force, that many of his inner circle, and those of his successor, Macaroth, called it, "the world that refused to die." Although only the central archives of the Departmento Munitorum can render an accurate figure, it is estimated that, between 760 and 773.M41, over 8,000,000 Guardsmen were killed in combat there - more, in fact, than were lost in the siege of Morlond.[1a] The initial campaign was promising: an Imperial force under the joint command of Generals Kelso and Forgues reached Cociaminus in 760.M41, and, thanks largely to Kelso's reliance on armour and the skill of the Narmenian 1st Armoured Regiment, overcame three hive cities in six months: Harshen, Bolliqen and Nazeth. Two significant tank battles took place outside Harshen, both ending in victory and cementing then-Colonel Coron Grizmund's reputation as an armour commander.[1a]
Orbiana	Orbiana is a Feral World of the Severan Dominate, located in The Periphery at the spinward extent of the Severan Dominate, representing the last human settled world along the Calixis-Scarus Warp conduit before that twisting route plunges into the benighted depths of inter-sector Wilderness Space. Orbiana is characterized by its wild, storm-wracked terrain and chaotic weather patterns. The native human population exists in a feral, near-atavistic state. In high orbit around the planet is a massive and ancient defence platform. The station’s plasma generators have long since gone cold, but its capital-grade weaponry remains fixed toward the void. While the platform's origins remain uncertain, it is believed to have been moved to its current position in millennia past—possibly as part of a long-forgotten defensive measure meant to protect the Calixis Sector from an unidentified, now-extinct threat.
Amistel 24th Cavalry Regiment	The 24th Amistel Cavalry are an Imperial Guard Regiment from Amistel. They are known to have fought on the Imperium's side during the 13th Black Crusade, though at the beginning of the crusade, insufficient information on their deployment was available to Imperial commanders.
Gathalamor	Gathalamor is an Imperial world in the Segmentum Solar, to the galactic south-west of Terra. Gathalamor is known mostly as being the diocese of the heretic Cardinal Bucharis during the Age of Apostasy, whose heresies reached such an extent that they became known as the Plague of Unbelief. The world's population was not rich and many lived in abject poverty. Bucharis took over and enslaved the population, forcing them to build a gigantic Cardinal Palace. He also took a large number of thugs and cut-throats and assaulted the nearby world of Rhanda. The resulting empire made Gathalamor fairly rich, although Bucharis' ideals of survival of the fittest meant many of the poorest died. Gathalamor is the site of the tomb of the Great Confessor Dolan Chirosius, who was martyred on the world by Bucharis. His martyrdom quickly inspired the population to rise up and kill Bucharis. At the end, all that remained of his body was a small pile of ashes. From then on, the world was back under the rule of Terra and remains so to this day.
Jumael Volunteers	The Jumael Volunteers are an Imperial Guard Regiment, made up of conscripts from the mostly rural farming communities of the verdant agri world of Jumael IV. Basic training follows the standard (if somewhat rushed) model of the Imperial Guard: drill, route marching and learning the Imperial Infantryman's Uplifting Primer by heart.[2a][2b] In battle, troopers wear a heavy vest of ballistic cloth with extra pectoral protection and flexible shoulder reinforcements.[Needs Citation]
Cocholos	Cocholos is a Necron Tomb World. Originally inhabited by the Necrons, at some point it was settled by humans of the Imperium. Later on, the Daemon Prince Beublghor slaughtered the human population and transformed the planet into a lifeless orb. Eventually the Necrons of the Oltep Dynasty would reawaken and unsuccessfully battle Beublghor and his Daemonic legions in the Corewar.
Diesos	Diesos is a Forge World of the Dark Mechanicum. In 993.M41, the Warpsmith Vhostok Pistonhand launched a coup against the rulers and took control of its soul-forges for his own ends. However, Pistonhand's reckless use of Daemons eventually brought a massive Daemonic retaliation on the planet, beginning a war that remains unsettled.
The Masters, Bidding (Short Story)	Treacheries of the Space Marines is a Black Library anthology, edited by Christian Dunn and featuring stories by Anthony Reynolds, Aaron Dembski-Bowden, Matthew Farrer, and Sarah Cawkwell, among others. It was published on September 25, 2012. The Space Marines of the Adeptus Astartes are the defenders of mankind, the ultimate superhuman brotherhood standing against the evils of the galaxy. But even among their hallowed ranks, there are those who would turn their backs on their brothers and follow the path of the traitor. Gathered within these pages, you will find tales from the dark side of the Imperium — remember, that which can defend, can also betray... By Matthew Farrer
Tabulata	Tabulata was the site where the Blood Angels Chapter defeated a force of Chaos Space Marines.
Urdek	Urdek is an Eldar Maiden World that has been colonized by the Imperium. Sometime after the Great Rift's creation, the Craftworld Iyanden invaded Urdek in an attempt to reclaim the world for the Eldar, but its forces were defeated by the Dark Angels Chapter.
Elboryth	Elboryth's cramped tunnelplexes are the constant site of a war between raiding bands of the Dark Eldar, Sisters of Battle and Necrons. They all are attempting to seize control of the world's buried catacombs from each other in order to claim the riches that lie within them.
Na'jadar	Na'jadar is a Desert World. The Iron Hands once repelled an Ork invasion on this planet.
Gehenna Campaign	The Gehenna Campaign was a battle fought in 955.M41 between the Blood Angels Chapter and the Necrons on the Imperial world of Gehenna. Commander Dante and the 3rd Company of the Blood Angels did battle against the Necron Legions of the Silent King amidst the dusty wastes of Gehenna. For three weeks, neither side could seize the upper hand, with Dante's tactical brilliance stretched to its limits in countering the space-time manipulations of the Silent King. The stalemate was broken only when a Tyranid splinter fleet entered orbit, forcing the two armies to break off hostilities and fight against a common foe. The impromptu alliance defeated the Tyranids in the end and, after the battle, Dante and the Silent King went their separate ways, both too exhausted from the battle against the Tyranids to continue their war and at least for Commander Dante, the distasteful idea of turning on those who they had recently fought alongside.
Sidon 452	Sidon 452 is a Forge World. The starship Star of Venam was built in its Forge Yards in M39.
Cryptosa II	Cryptosa II was the site of a battle between the forces of Chaos and the Imperium.
Gudrun	Gudrun is the former capital of the Helican subsector and has been the home to human settlers for 3,500 years. The planet is ruled by a feudal system of noble patronage which extends even beyond its own star system into neighboring worlds. It is the recruiting ground for the Gudrunite Rifles regiments of the Imperial Guard. A founding of a new regiment is always a cause for a planet-wide celebration. Once the capital of the Helican Sector, in 241.M41 one of the preeminent noble houses on Gudrun — House Glaw — was found to be pervaded by a Chaos cult. Once this came to be known the noble house was destroyed. The damage caused to the reputation and prestige of Gudrun led to the relocation of Sector Headquarters to Thracian Primaris.[Needs Citation]
Forge World	Φ-class or Forge Worlds, as classified by the Imperium, are the worlds of the Adeptus Mechanicus—worlds totally devoted to industry and to the Cult Mechanicus's own occult worship. The majority of a Forge World's solid ground surface is covered in thousands of years of built-up, massive industrial complexes: great machine factories, production centres, huge volcanic furnaces, skyscraping chimneys, abyss-like quarries and the great workshop-fortresses of the Collegia Titanica. No other world can match the quality and quantity of a forge world's output. The Adeptus Mechanicus possesses a monopoly on the advanced technological knowledge of Terra's past; consequently, Forge Worlds are the sole producers of the Imperium's more unique and advanced equipment: high-end personal weapons, spacecraft, war machines such as tanks, fighters, and even Titans, as well as more mundane but vital and advanced equipment.
Ammunheim	Ammunheim was invaded by a splinter of Hive Fleet Behemoth during the First Tyrannic War, after the Alpha Legion used Imperial pilgrim convoys to lure the Tyranids to the Forge World. Before the Forge World was invaded, the Adeptus Mechanicus diverted its forces to defend Ammunheim. The Alpha Legion then used this opportunity to launch dozens of raids into now unguarded Imperial territory. The Chaos Space Marines were able to escape with thousands of Astropaths, for some dark and unknown purpose, while the fate of Ammunheim is unknown.
Palatine Crusade	The Palatine Crusade was a military effort (or Crusade) by the forces of the Imperium to free the worlds of the Palatine Sector from secessionist rebels. The Crusade was headed by the Inquisitor Lord Ansgar and became noteworthy due to the miracle of Saint Celestine. The war against the secessionists by the Sisters of Battle had ground to a stalemate on the world of Eurytion. Celestine was to be found at the head of the first attack wave assaulting the capitals defenses, leading Sisters Repentia. By all accounts Celestine was killed that day along with every other Repentia. As Celestine's body was put amongst the dead, her sisters saw her miraculously resurrect. Invigorated, the next day the assault on the city resumed with Celestine at its head. This time, the capital fell within scant hours and Celestine was declared the Crusades figurehead. Inquisitor Ansgar, the Crusade's commander, believed the crusade would reach its conclusion at the capital world of the Palatine sector, but Celestine insisted first on taking a small, backwards planet named Sanctus Lys. Unknown to all bu ther, the world was home to the ancient Shrine of the Holy Heart, a place once visited by Saint Katherine. Amidst its shattered ruins, Celestine unearthed an ancient tomb and entered it alone. When she emerged, she was clad in golden shining armor and wielded a shining blade wreathed in sweet-scented petals. After this act, Inquisitor Ansgar and his conclave of Thorians declared Celestine a Living Saint. She then swept through the Palatine Sector, reclaiming it for the Emperor.
Laser weapon	Electric (Arc • Tesla) • Flame • Gauss • Graviton • Grenade • Ion/Plasma • Laser • Melta • Missile • Bolt • Ordnance • Projectile • Grenade launcher • Monofilament/Web • Sonic • Volkite Chain • Force • Electric (Arc • Taser) • Power • Miscellaneous Laser weapons or las weapons is a name given to all Imperial and some alien laser based weapons. Imperial laser technology is relatively simple, with most Imperial worlds possessing the technological base needed for their manufacture. Las weapons are cheap, easy to maintain and are some of the most reliable weapons of the Imperium. They are issued in vast numbers to the Imperial Guard in the form of the lasgun and these are readily available on most Imperial worlds.
The Path Forsaken (Audio Drama)	The Path Forsaken is an audio drama by Rob Sanders, released in June 2013. Indiscriminate in their destruction, the Tyranid host consumes all in its path, sparing nothing and brooking no parley. The Exodite World of Ephraeleon will be the next to fall, its people unprepared and undefended, but for Eldar Ranger Una Belphoebe the fate of the planet means nothing compared to the love of her prince. With the chitinous horde already descending on the jungles of Ephraeleon, has her desperate rescue come too late?
Kalleth	Kalleth was an isolated world in the Nostramo Sector, deep in the ancient heartlands of Nostramo's old fiefdom. Kalleth's surface featured bleak, icy plains, deep canyons and ice caves. A mass grave of over 400 human and Legionary corpses was found on one of the plains near the crash site of the Shroud of Eventide. Although the planet is listed as destroyed in 011.M31, explorator teams discovered signs that a handful of individuals may have survived in the canyons and caves until at least 017.M31. During the Horus Heresy, Kalleth was the site of a battle between the Night Lords Legion and the Ashen Claws in 011.M31. An advance squadron of Night Lords vessels led by Captain Ophion of the Kyroptera was engaged by a dozen cruisers above the planet, both sides landing troops planetside. Although the Ashen Claws were forced to retreat, Ophion's vessel, the Shroud of Eventide, was destroyed and crashed on an ice plain. Fewer than 100 dead crew were found aboard the wreck when it was discovered in 017.M31.
Dreska	Dreska is a world of the galaxy, located near the border between Segmentum Tempestus and the Ultima Segmentum. A number of Tallarn regiments fought against the Necrons on Dreska in 997.M41.
Asgardian Rangers	The Asgardian Rangers (or Rangers of Asgard) are Imperial Guard Regiments from the Feudal World of Asgard. The Asgardian Rangers specialise in scouting and camouflage, especially mounted on horses. They have special, biologically-enhanced mounts bred to have incredible endurance and tenacity, with resistance to wounds or poison, allowing them to go through the most dense forest or barren desert with little problems. They come from a Feudal World and are seen as a very feral people. They are supposedly better at scouting than Space Marine Scouts, as they do not need fuel or other resources that are usually scarce in a besieged city. From what little combat they have seen, they are capable warriors and adept at using Sniper Rifles.
Lilia Mundi	Lilia Mundi was once an eldar Maiden World known as Lelialthar, now the planet is under the jurisdiction of the Imperium of Man, a Feral World and well-known as a Black Templars recruiting world. In the eighth century of M41 it would become the site of a conflict between the Templars and the Eldar. The population of approximately 4,500,000 is predominantly arranged in a martial culture organised around a brutal warrior code. These local 'Iron Bloods' feral tribes produce the ideal candidates for induction into the chapters of the Adeptus Astartes, with the Black Templars chapter maintaining a presence on the planet at the Vengeris Keep. The planet was attacked in the eighth century of the 41st Millennium by Eldar of the Saim-Hann Craftworld, after the Iron Bloods' failed to respond to an evacuation ultimatum issued by an envoy at a tribal contest. The small garrison of Templars was originally overrun by the Eldar forces of Archon Triadhu Firesong, Wraithlord Prince Valtun and his advisor the farseer Oerlin Fargaze. Eldar battle technology was too advanced for the feral tribes, with anti-personnel skimmers exacting a large toll on the population.
Gidrim	Gidrim is a Necron Tomb World that forms a part of the Sautekh Dynasty of Imotekh the Stormlord. Ruled over by the Nemesor Zahndrekh, it has expanded into a miniature empire to the point of including a dozen star systems.

Emele	Emele is a world in Segmentum Pacificus, and is part of the Cabulis System. It is a Maiden World, and a Forbidden World. Currently it and the entire Cabulis System are under attack by Waaagh! Gragnatz.
Vakon Alpha	Vakon Alpha is planet with vast, dead thornwood forests and winters that would freeze a guardsman down to their marrow.[1a][1b][1c] The world of Vakon has had multiple campaigns occur, being refered to as the Vakonian Winter Wars.[1d] The planet was the location of a triple-fronted battle group comprised of Moebian, Noctan and Valhallan regiments. An instrumental part of victory was the use of the "Vakonin Winter" pattern camouflage.[1a]
Holda	Holda is a Dead World located on the Eastern Fringe. The complete eradication of all life on the planet bears similarities to that found on the nearby worlds of Naogeddon, Dunen II, Berien VI and Doton, and also on Evangel.
Haxan Prime	Haxan Prime is a Quarantined World of the Imperium. It is described as a "hollow" planet.
Helios	Helios is an Imperial Forge World, known for being the original birthplace of the Land Raider Helios. During the infamous Siege of Helios in 857.M38, the Red Scorpions Chapter helped the planet to repel the Orks invasion. In gratitude they were granted with the secret of the Helios pattern missile launcher. Henceforth the Red Scorpions armed their Land Raiders with this launcher and always came to help the citizens of Helios against the ongoing ork attacks. It is known that the Blood Angels' 2nd Company fought for gas refineries on this planet against some unknown enemy.
Ultra Maximus	Ultra Maximus is a world of the Imperium that was conquered by the Tau Empire, but has since been retaken by the Imperium's forces; among them Captain Kor'sarro Khan of the White Scars Chapter.
Dunan	Dunan was the site of a battle between Orks and the Vostroyan 68th Firstborn Regiment.
Behemoth	Hive Fleet Behemoth was the first Tyranid Hive Fleet encountered by the Imperium, and was also the first contact the Imperium had with the Tyranids as a race. Behemoth made a juggernaut rush into the Galaxy from the Eastern Fringe and proceeded into Ultramar, resulting in what became known as the First Tyrannic War.[1a] It was eventually destroyed at the Battle for Macragge in 745.M41 [1a] or 746.M41 depending on the source. Early warning signs of the apocalyptic threat of Hive Fleet Behemoth came from an Explorator census of the planetary Systems on the Eastern Fringe surrounding Tyran undertaken in the preceding decade before Behemoth's invasion. Planets known to have been full of life were discovered reduced to lifeless, barren rock without even any living bacteria. These mysterious new Dead Worlds were reported to the Explorator General but nothing came of it. The outpost on Tyran also filed its own reports of discovered dead worlds, but no help was sent.[1b] Hive Fleet Behemoth attacked from the galactic south-east of the Eastern Fringe without warning and ploughed wildly into the galaxy, ruining hundreds of systems and devouring everything in its path. Compared to later Hive Fleets which adopted different strategies, Behemoth showed no subtlety in its berserker advance. Eventually its onslaught used more biomass than it could replace and it all but consumed itself in the process of breaking the Imperial defence at the Battle for Macragge.[1a]
House Mortan	House Mortan is a Knight House of the Imperium. By the time the ancestors of House Mortan had arrived upon Kimdaria, the mysterious nebula known as the Black Pall that surrounded the planet had grown unexpectedly dense.[5a] Fell creatures, already accustomed to the world’s dim light, roamed the ink-black landscapes, and it was only through the skill and dedication of the colonists’ Knights that the beasts were driven back and the first settlements established. For millennia after the Great Crusade, the Black Pall lingered over Kimdaria and its star system – not until late M35 did the impenetrable shroud partially dissipate, letting in a few diffused rays of sunlight and allowing the long-lost planet to be rediscovered by Mankind. What they found was a bleak and ritualistically ordered world, a place where soaring walls separated civilisation from the monster- haunted darkness that lay beyond. From heavy gates the black Knights of House Mortan would regularly emerge, their constant patrols keeping the encroaching predatory behemoths at bay. The towering war machines had become as accustomed to the endless night as the beasts they hunted, the darkness of their home world seeming to cling to them even when standing in the light, and so as to better fight their obscured enemies, the Knights of House Mortan placed a premium upon close combat. It is a tendency that holds to this day.[5a]

On Carandiru
Epsion Octarius	Epsion Octarius is a world which was invaded by the Orks of Warlord Grubnuk. The current status of the planet is unknown but a regiment of Catachan Jungle Fighters spent forty days amongst Crotalid-infested swamps, making their way towards Grubnuk's Gargant construction facility.

Malbolge IV	Malbolge IV was the site of a battle for the Iron Hands Chapter, which resulted in the death of the Iron Father Bartolk.
Mordian	Mordian is a Imperium Hive World that was renowned as the Homeworld of the Iron Guard Regiments of the Imperial Guard. Mordian is a tidally locked planet; the time of the planet's rotation equal to the time of its revolution around its sun. Consequently, half of the planet is in perpetual darkness while the other is constantly burned by the harsh sun. All life is on its dark side. For good reason, Mordian is also known as the World of Eternal Night. Mordian's hundreds of millions of inhabitants live on a land surface barely one tenth the size of Earth. Its hive cities are characterized by pyramidal, multi-levelled towers rising like mountains towards space. The government is known as the Tetrarchy, and strictly controls and rations the planet's meager resources. Mordian naturally breeds discontent, and the Iron Guard is the only thing that stands between order and total anarchy.
Innocence III	Innocence III is an Imperium Shrine World. In M38, Innocence III nearly fell to a Daemonic incursion, before the Salamanders Chapter's Sixth Company arrived and saved its three remaining shrine cities from destruction. When the safety of the cities was secured, the vengeful Salamanders purged the Daemons from the Shrine World.
Janus	The name or term "Janus" may refer to:
Rilaea Secundus	Rilaea Secundus is a Agri World of the Imperium.
Warlord Battle Titan	The Warlord Battle Titan is a class of Imperial Battle Titan. It is the most numerous of Imperial Titans with millions having been built over the many years of its existence; in fact the design is older than the Imperium of Man itself.[6a] The Warlord is essentially a walking fortress, packing enough firepower to wipe out entire armies on its own. The only true threat to a Warlord is another Titan of the same magnitude, such as those used by the traitorous Dark Mechanicus or the alien Ork and Eldar races. Thousands of Warlord Titans saw action on both sides during the wars of the Horus Heresy. The Warlord is by far the most widely employed, numerous and versatile class of Imperial Battle Titan deployed by the Collegia Titanica; it is second in power only to the rare Emperor Class Titans. Some Warlords date back to time of the Great Crusade or even the Dark Age of Technology. The sheer longevity of the Warlord means a variety of different patterns and variants have been built, some mounting unusual upgrades such as landing platforms for aircraft, siege rams to batter down walls and assault pods to disgorge infantry into the enemy's strongholds. This also means the design's capabilities and tolerances are well-known among the Mechanicus, making the Warlord an ideal test-bed for new devices conjured up by the Divisio Investigatus.[6a] The primary role of a Warlord is as front-line combatant where the fighting is heaviest. Its primary line of defence are six Void Shield generators which intercept enemy fire before it even hits the war engine. So powerful are these shields that a Warlord can withstand continuous bombardment from over five dozen armoured vehicle and artillery platforms with no loss of shield strength.[2e] Beneath the shields are meters of adamantium armoured plating, which themselves can ward off a regiment's worth of firepower with but minor scarring.[10a] The weaponry the Warlord mounts is similarly stupendous, with four primary Titan-grade systems and numerous secondary armaments for fighting in built-up areas. So powerful are these weapons that Warlords can level entire cities with them.[10b] A Warlord can easily destroy a Warhound Scout Titan in a matter of seconds,[3h] and will handily defeat a Reaver Battle Titan in a one-on-one duel.[2i] Warlord Battle Titans do have one weakness in that their plasma reactor is located in the abdominal cavity, making it susceptible to heavy weapons fire if the armour is breached. For this reason many Warlords are geared towards long-range fire support.
Eorcshia	Eorcshia was a rain-drenched Imperium bastion world that was destroyed by a splinter of Hive Fleet Kraken during the Second Tyrannic War. A Deathwatch Kill-Team later arrived and though they were too late to save Eorcshia, they successfully planted nucleonic charges within the bio-ship feeding on the dying world. Upon the charges' detonation, the entire splinter fleet fell into disorder.
Drakus Prime	Drakus Prime is an Imperium world.
Scarus Sector	The Scarus Sector is a division of the Segmentum Obscurus close to the Eye of Terror. It borders the Calixis Sector Rimward, the Ixaniad Sector Trailing and the Askellon Sector Coreward. The Scarus Sector was originally named after Captain Scarus of the 52nd Company of the Word Bearers Legion (by decree of Lorgar). Captain Scarus and his entire company was lost to the warp during passage through the sector during The Pilgrimage. In the early-mid M41, the sector was also the main area of operation for the Inquisitors Gregor Eisenhorn and Gideon Ravenor.
Valskalf	Valskalf is an Imperial Squat world and is the homeworld of the Mjolnir Brotherhood.
Kappa Veldt	Kappa Veldt is an Imperial world that creates the well known liquor Ambrosian, which is exported to other worlds.
White Dwarf 140 (UK)	White Dwarf 140 UK
Etorras	Etorras was an Imperium world, until its population fell under the influence of the T'au and later joined the Xenos' Empire. This drew the attention of the Black Templars Chapter and Castellan Draco and his forces were sent to Etorras, to conduct raids designed to punish the traitorous population. The legendary Tau Commander O'Shovah soon came to defend Etorras from Draco's wrath and the world became a battle ground between their two forces.
Honourum	Honourum is the homeworld of the Novamarines Chapter. Honourum is found in the galactic north of the Ultima Segmentum, far away from the Realm of Ultramar and near the Halo Stars. The region around Honourum is sparsely populated and filled with vast tracts of unexplored wilderness space that is host to all manner of ancient threats, nascent alien empires and as-yet undiscovered lost human worlds. The world was originally claimed by the Ultramarines during the Horus Heresy, when a loyalist force led by Captain Arceas Odinathus assaulted a Word Bearers garrison. After 3 weeks of fighting that saw the traitors unleash Warp and Age of Strife-era horrors, the blasted ruin of Honourum was captured.
Nimboru	Nimboru is an Ice World, and currently a warzone between the Word Bearers and the Ultramarines Chapter.
Eldritch	Eldritch is a dead world, located in the Ultima Segmentum. Formerly a Necron-held planet, Eldritch was destroyed via an exterminatus order carried out in 998.M41 by three companies of the Sable Swords Space Marine chapter.
Sarlax	Sarlax was an Imperium Agri World, whose population raised Grox on its plains. However the world fell to the forces of Chaos during the 13th Black Crusade.
Pluvioris	Pluvioris is a Daemon World in the Eye of Terror. Pluvioris is unusual in that the world is actually a gigantic sleeping colossus, whose dreams cause it to writhe in constant pain and pleasure. Remarkably, the colossus's surface is populated, but only by those who have spent their lives chasing their dreams, only to pay the ultimate price for their lack of faith. Whenever those cursed to dwell on Pluvioris let their imaginations run wild and conjure a new fear or horror to torment themselves, it will be birthed by the colossus and come crawling from its nearest pore, to greet their parent in a shower of blood and gore. Unfortunately, death is not the end on the Daemon World, and the next night, the victim will crawl reborn from Pluvioris's cavernous mouth and their nightmarish existence will begin once more.
Jouran Dragoons	The Jouran Dragoons are Imperial Guard Regiments raised from Jouran. They are mostly mechanised infantry. The men and women of the Jouran Dragoons ride into battle in armoured transports like the Chimera. They are often seen in the vanguard of Imperial armies supporting armoured regiments like the Narmenian or Ketzok Armoured. Some of these associations stretch back over millennia and the Jourans have participated in the speartip of many great campaigns throughout the Imperium. After a salient has been created by the heavy tanks of the armoured regiments, the Jouran Dragoons speed through the gaps to gain territory and disrupt the enemy front. Masters of blitzkrieg warfare, the Jouran regiments are often seen following armoured thrusts closely. Many a campaign has been won by a timely coup de main executed by the Jouran Dragoons.[2a]
Dawn Blade	The Dawn Blade is a weapon wielded by Commander Farsight of the Tau. He found it in a mysterious temple on the world of Arthas Moloch, using it to fight creatures that were almost certainly Chaos Daemons. It flickers with unknown energy and when he swings it, sharp enough to cut through rock, it cuts a swathe easily through most enemies and armoured vehicles. Unknown to its wielder its blade is made from chronophagic alloys which add a slain foe's remaining natural lifespan to that of its owners. This is the secret of Farsight's remarkable longevity, which has spanned to over three centuries.
Arconar	Arconar is a Feral World controlled by the Imperium. It was at the centre of the Battle of Arconar, where Marneus Calgar led the Ultramarines to attack a coalition of Eldar forces. They managed to capture their bases on both the land and in orbit.
Khymara	Khymara is an Imperial planet. During the Badab War in 907.M41 on the lunar outposts of Khymara, a small contingent of the Howling Griffons Space Marine Chapter suffered great losses at the hands of the Executioners Chapter.
White Dwarf August 2019	White Dwarf is Games Workshop's premium Warhammer magazine, packed with amazing content each month such as new rules and background, short stories, regular columns, special guests and more. Your questions answered! Why would allies ever fight each other? Phil Kelly tackles this, and other tricky questions, in his monthly column.
Calistra	Calistra is a Frontier World of the Imperium, located in the Calixis Sector.
Candau	Candau is a Dead World, formerly of the Imperium. Once a productive Agri World, Candau is now a lifeless husk not far from the Jericho Reach. When farming serfs unearthed a stasis casket containing a stash of archaeotech, the planetary Governor set the population to work searching for more such caskets. News of the find spread, and heretics assaulted the world, working much of the population to their deaths to find more relics. When the Relictors later arrived and drove out the heretics, they claimed the last relics of Candau in memory of its people. Most remain in the Chapter Armoury, but the first weapon to be drawn from the ancient casket, the projectile weapon Candau's Doom, was granted to the Deathwatch.
Mezoa	Mezoa is a Forge World and naval base located in the Cyclops Cluster sub-sector of Segmentum Obscurus. The volcanic world of Mezoa was founded during the early phases of the Great Crusade, and its construction was overseen by the Mechanicum, the Emperor of Mankind and Ferrus Manus. During the Horus Heresy, Mezoa was attacked by the forces of Chaos and became encircled by the Dark Empire. Despite its status as a forge world, Mezoa has never been home to any Titan Legion, as the solidified lava that forms much of its surface would not support the colossal weight of those war machines.
Aspirant	An Aspirant is a human youth selected for possible induction into the Space Marines. Recruits are chosen from the best warriors among humanity, although the recruitment process varies considerably between chapters. Most Chapters recruit from their homeworld, or local sector worlds, while fleet-based chapters will often roam a particular sector of space, recruiting periodically from a few favoured worlds. Feral Worlds are considered prize recruiting worlds, because of the toughness of their human inhabitants; for the same reason, Hive Worlds are an ideal source of potential recruits, since the gang inhabitants of the lower levels are some of the toughest, most murderous examples of humanity in the galaxy. Feudal Worlds are also considered to be ideal sources for potential recruits, by recruiting from the worlds' warrior nobility. Much more rarely, certain Civilised Worlds are also recruited from.
Lost Hope (Short Story)	Lost Hope is a short story by Black Library Publishing In desperate need of fresh troops for his long campaign against traitors and renegades, General Creed of the Cadian 8th and his aide, Colour Sergeant Kell, head to the world of Lost Hope, a frozen and dangerous prison planet. But when they discover that the prisoners have revolted and the world is in the grip of heresy, their mission becomes much more complicated, and they realise that their foes' plans are greater and more convoluted than they could have ever imagined
After Desh'ea (Short Story)	"After Desh'ea" is a short story by Matthew Farrer in the Horus Heresy series. It was first published in Tales of Heresy in 2009, and later separately, in print and as an audiobook. It was collected in Angron and Lupercal's War. With the discovery of the lost primarch Angron came violence and confusion, and what should have been the defining moment of the War Hounds Legion instead became a humbling embarrassment. As their senior officers fall one by one to the rage of the newly freed gladiator-king, it seems that they are doomed – perhaps their last chance for redemption comes in the form of the Eighth Captain, Khârn. Will this calm and level-headed warrior be able to lead his father into the Emperor’s light, or will he join the rest of his Legion in death? A tense conference takes place on the bridge of the flagship of the War Hounds Space Marine Legion. Their primarch, Angron, was just teleported aboard their ship from his homeworld. For every other legion, the finding of their primarch has been a day of joy, but for the War Hounds it is one of violence and uncertainty. Their primarch has been confined to a hold in the bowels of the ship, and every Captain who has tried to treat with him has failed to return. The remaining Captains are at a loss what to do, until one of their number, Khârn, volunteers to be the next to try.
Fool's Paradise	Fool's Paradise is a Daemon World.[1a] Formerly an Imperial world[1b], at some point between 997[1b] and 999.M41, Fool's Paradise became a Daemon World.[1a] In 999.M41, Colonel Schaeffer and his 13th Penal Legion led a raid on the planet to hunt down the Daemon Prince Mk'lrathirix. Though they succeeded in their mission to slay Mk'lrathirix, only two of the Imperial soldiers survived the battle.[1a]
Damocles Gulf	The Damocles Gulf is a region of deadly nebulae[1a] in the Eastern Fringe that forms the effective border between the Imperium of Man's Ultima Segmentum and the core Septs of the T'au Empire. It was across this void that the failed Damocles Gulf Crusade was fought between the T'au and the Imperium, the first time the two forces met militarily. Following the Imperial retreat the T'au solidified their control and, under the renegade Commander Farsight, captured sufficient new worlds on the human side of the Gulf to create the Farsight Enclaves. Subsequent T'au Spheres of Expansion saw their influence extend across and beyond the Gulf. They divided the region into distinct "parallels" and dispatched Water Caste diplomatic missions to prepare the way, such as the Whispertide Concordance and its overtures to the blighted Yuxa System. These actions goaded the Imperium, sparking a continuous series of engagements in the Gulf, notably the tit-for-tat Battle of Mu'gulath Bay, Fall of Prefectia,[1b] and Second Agrellan Campaign. At the conclusion of the latter battle the Adeptus Mechanicus unleashed an exotic weapon of such magnitude that Mu'gulath Bay was not only totally lost to both empires, but the destruction unleashed set across the entire Damocles Gulf, lighting it ablaze and effectively separating that side of the Imperium from the T'au. This also prevented any hope of reinforcement for the nascent Farsight Enclaves as they fought desperately in the War of Dakka. Such was the level of bloodshed and fire in the Gulf at this time that some speculate it helped create the Great Rift soon after.
Xarsis Plethis	Xarsis Plethis is a world of the Imperium.
Calderia	Calderia is an Imperial Civilized World.
Kar Duniash	Kar Duniash is the Segmentum Fortress[1a] and a naval academy of Ultima Segmentum.[1a] It is the site of a major shipyard that is the primary builder of Dominator Class Cruisers.[1b] Following the resurrection of Roboute Guilliman and the formation of the Great Rift, Kar Duniash was one of the worlds which became stranded in the Dark Imperium. It is currently located perilously close to the T'au Fifth Sphere of Expansion. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Australis Sunder	Australis Sunder is an Imperial world. It is the home of the Gansa tree, whose wood is exported to other worlds and is bought at an expensive price.
Morisha	Morisha is a world of the Imperium, located on the galaxy's Eastern Fringe. The planet is known to raise Rough Rider regiments for the Imperial Guard. At one point, the Governor of Morisha, Yawell, went renegade and turned against the Imperium. In 563.M37, the Officio Assassinorum dispatched Urhua Thereaux of Clade Venenum to kill Yawell, only for the assassin's ship to be caught in a Warp Rift, frozen in temporal stasis for 698 years.
Galmor	Galmor is a Death World covered in jungles and swamps. The vegetation is so thick, and the mud so treacherous, that fighting here results in drop zones being difficult, if not impossible to find. This often means that opposing armies are dropping troops right on top of each other while trading salvos in orbit.
Runes (Short Story)	"Runes" is a short story by Chris Wraight. A secret hides on the acid-wreathed world of Gath Rimmon. When the Space Wolves attempt to retrieve it, they must face the bizarre and dangerous aliens who call the world home, the mysterious eldar and one of their own who is not as they appear... Space Wolves
Accatran	Accatran is an Imperial Forge World situated on the edge of the Ork Empire of Charadon. It is home to the Legio Destructor (Beasts of Steel). A heavily polluted world, the Mechanicum rulers of Accatran live deep underground close to the planet's core. Highly hierarchical, the closer one lives from Accatran's core, the higher their status. While the ruling Magi live closest to the core, only the mad or barbaric tech-scavengers live on its hellscape of a surface. Visitors to Accatran are flown down into the planet's crust via landing tunnels and make planetfall at a location befitting of their position. The founder of Accatran was Xerxes Immortalis, a great general who, legend insists, had held the planet free of darkness for a full millennium and more.
White Dwarf 366 (UK)	White Dwarf 365 White Dwarf 194 White Dwarf 182 White Dwarf 174 White Dwarf 136 White Dwarf 366 was released in June 2010 featuring rules and missions for the Spearhead (expansion). It was the first issue published under new White Dwarf editor Andrew Kenrick, who replaced Mark Latham. ISSN 0265-8712 06
Misbegotten (Short Story)	Sons of the Emperor is an anthology novel Black Library Publishing. Part of The Primarchs series, the book is limited edition and was distributed at the Horus Heresy Weekender 2018 convention. From their shadowed origins to the desperate battles that ensued when half of them rebelled against their father, the Sons of the Emperor – the vaunted primarchs – were among the greatest of humanity's champions, warriors without peer and heroes whose deeds became legend. From the Angel Sanguinius, who took the sole brunt of his Legion's most brutal acts, to Vulkan, whose humanity made him unique amongst his brothers, and from dour Perturabo, architect, inventor and murderous warlord, to Horus, whose shining light was eclipsed only by the darkness that grew within his soul, this anthology covers eight of the primarchs and their greatest – or darkest – deeds. When a world resistant to the nascent Imperium of man unleashes weapons of heinous and proscribed provenance, Sanguinius gathers the Destroyer host. As his sons wage war behind their death masks, able to leave the taint of their bloody deeds behind them, Sanguinius alone must bear the burden of the souls he has reaped.
Jhal Sak III	Jhal Sak III is an Imperial world, that has been compared to such disreputable bowls of society as Necromunda, Vresh and parts of Armageddon. Like those worlds, Astra Militarum Regiments tithed from Jhal Sak III have a sectarian hierarchy. Because of this, reinforcement and integration for its Regiments are difficult, as rival elements are liable to turn on each other.
Sarum	Sarum was a world of the Imperium. Now it belongs to a Dark Mechanicum. Turbulently close to the Maelstrom, the planet itself is a barren landscape which lacks a habitable atmosphere. During the Age of Strife, the world became an Adeptus Mechanicus station but soon was isolated and embattled. On its own against raiders, xenos, and abhumans and without aid from Mars, the priests of Sarum became isolationists under a cult by their ruler, Redjak. Redjak solidified his Crimson Priesthood's power, taking over much of the Golgothan Sector. However, when Sarum faced a massive invasion by the Brotherhood of Ruin and their Ork allies, they pleaded for aid from the Imperium and finally received it in the form of the World Eaters 13th Expeditionary Fleet, led personally by Angron. In the ensuing Golgothan Slaughter, the Brotherhood of Ruin was annihilated by the World Eaters. However, Angron next turned his wrath on the Crimson Priests of Sarum, scouring the planet and claiming it as his forward operating base for the next eleven years in a campaign against the Priests remaining empire. Sarum pledged itself to the forces of Horus during the Horus Heresy and became a Forge World for the Dark Mechanicum.[2a] During the Heresy, Sarum continued to supply the World Eaters with their armaments.
Gohliath IV	Gohliath IV is a world of the Imperium. Quirion Octavius used the tremendous influence of the Imperial Fists to negotiate the fabled Truce of Gohliath. He managed to bring a viciously evangelical local branch of the Ecclesiarchy to the conference table, in the legendary Gohliath palace.
Pariah Nexus	The Pariah Nexus, known to the Necrons themselves as the Contra-Empyric Nexus[5b] is a Necron Pylon array in the Nephilim Sector within Ultima Segmentum. Also known as the Zone of Silence, it is a region of space that seems to be free from the influences of the Warp. The Imperium thus named it after the Pariah Gene, which has a similar effect of suppressing the Warp. In truth, the Nexus is a vast Blackstone array constructed by the Necrons, more specifically the Cryptek Szeras and the Nihilakh Dynasty. Considered the pinnacle of Necron cosmic engineering, at the heart of the network is the Xendu System where an immense Blackstone cage has been constructed. Around the System are vast amounts of Necron orbitals and warships to guard over their great work. Further out lay networks of vast Blackstone Pylons, their deployment extending through patterns of non-euclidean fractal crypto-logic incomprehensible to mortal minds. Scattered through nodal and outlier systems, each pylon was a unique colossal structure whose purpose was to sustain and extend a field of anti-empyric energy. Pylons were seeded on target worlds with an immense Pylon Ship.[5a] During the Indomitus Crusade, the Imperial Battlegroup Kallides was sent to investigate the Nexus, instigating a war there. Imperials in this region soon found themselves effected by a damaging malaise and energy-sapping field dubbed "The Stilling". It is speculated the stilling originates from the many Pylons in the Nexus.
Ondermanx	Ondermanx is a world of the galaxy, that was the site of sighting between Imperial forces and Eldar at some point prior to the Sabbat Worlds Crusade.[Note 1] The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Signus Prime	Signus Prime was the main planet of the Signus Cluster, a trinary star system of seven Hive Worlds and fifteen moons. Once a major industrial center, the System of Signus fell prey to the agents of Chaos during the dark days of the Horus Heresy. It became a Realm of Chaos, a system of Daemon Worlds, under the rule of Kyriss the Perverse, Greater Daemon of Slaanesh. Kyriss raised for itself a vast palace on Signus Prime, the Cathedral of the Mark, and its daemonic horde rampaged across the system, utterly destroying hundreds of years of civilization and annihilating several planets. The entire populace was either butchered, enslaved, or corrupted, and all hope fled its inhabitants. Deliverance came, ironically, in the form of Sanguinius and the Blood Angels Space Marine Legion, sent by the Warmaster Horus to what was supposed to be their doom.[1a] During the Horus Heresy, Signus Prime was the site of an important battle between the Blood Angels and the daemonic armies of Ka'Bandha. After the battle, the entire cluster was declared morti perpetua ("forever dead") and quarantined. The Blood Angels expunged all records of their presence on Signus, resettled the few living survivors in neighbouring systems, and deployed beacons to warn starfarers away from the Signus system. They also deployed a tactical cyclonic device to destroy the Cathedral of the Mark and a massive chunk of the continent with it.
Asherkin	Asherkin is an Imperium world.
Klawjaw	Also known as the Mighty Mangler of Bork, Klawjaw is an infamous Ork Warlord who created the Ork Empire of Bork and still leads his Waaagh! Bork through the Galaxy. Klawjaw was once known simply as Kog, a primitive thug living on the Ork-held side of the planet, known to them as Bork. In time he grew in size and strength and many predicted him to become the leader of his tribe, however that was to become a serious underestimation. Once while hunting he ate a mutated Squig and passed out. When he awoke he was a very different Ork. When he came back to his tribe he was clad in rusted metal and towered over the biggest Orks in tribe. The first Ork to ask if this was Kog got his head smashed and his arms bitten off. The newcomer called himself Klawjaw. Before long he united the neighbouring tribes and in time all Orks of Bork were bound together in awe for his brutality.[2a] Klawjaw began his conquests with putting his home world to Ork control. In a long and bloody campaign he fought united forces of Imperium, including Imperial Guard, Ultramarines, Dark Angels, Howling Griffons and Blood Angels. In the end he crushed all of them and succeeded in destroying planet's capital, Furnicehive and bringing the whole planet to his control.[2b]
Vetrim	Vetrim was a bond-world to the T'au Empire, until Chapter Master Dante and the Blood Angels freed the population from the control of their deceitful Xenos overlords.
Scathe	Scathe is the third planet of the Modren's Realm System. Scathe is the de facto capital of Modren's Realm. It is the first colonised world of the system. The catacombs and ancient structures of some alien race on its surface became the basis for colony and establishment of a stronghold. Scathe is the most heavily fortified of the system's worlds, with most of the structures built atop the xenos ruins. Below the major palace of a planet, heretek Forcyz makes his sinister experiments.
Saint Cyllia's World	Saint Cyllia's World is an Imperium world and was the site of the Saint Cyllia Massacres.
Krourk	Krourk is an Imperial planet of steppe lands and high gravity, inhabited by an abnormally brutal and primitive population of Ogryns. The planet is comprised of seemingly endless, arid plains with enormous sabretoothed fauna, more dangerous than any renegade insurrectionists. The Ogryns act as a source of particularly brutal and savage forces for the Imperial Guard. Outside of this, the planet is considered worthless, and the Imperium leaves the Ogryn population to its own devices. When required, Imperial troop ships land on the planet to capture several tribes, which are formed into the Krourk Ogryn Auxilia. Squads of the Auxilia are distributed among existing human regiments to fight on distant battlefields.
Nebrus IX	Nebrus IX was a former world of the Imperium. Disease had swept across the tiny planet of Nebrus IX and the cities had been overrun by Plague Zombies despite the efforts of the Imperial Guard. Mordian and Noctan Imperial Guard regiments were retreating to an evacuation point, when the Inquisition called for an Exterminatus on the planet. The Stormtroopers regiment known as the Redemption Corps, were sent in at the eleventh hour and evacuated the surviving Noctans and Mordians, mere moments before cyclonic torpedos impacted on the planet.
Tesslan VI	Tesslan VI was an Imperial Relic World, that was consumed by Tyranids. Before it fell, the Imperium's forces fought against the Xenos to allow time for Tesslan VI's population and precious relics to be evacuated. Among those forces, was a strike force from the Salamanders Chapter, led by the Forgefather Vulkan He'stan, which fought with distinction and saved many of the world's relics.
Shenlong	Shenlong was a Forge World in the Ultima Segmentum which was subjected to Exterminatus after falling to the forces of Chaos. Serving as a Forge World since the Dark Age of Technology, the people of Shenlong worshiped a dragon-god. During the Great Crusade, the Emperor himself arrived on Shenlong and forced them into compliance. Among those killed by the Emperor was the creator of Lantern, which would go on to become the personal sidearm of his son, the primarch Mortarion. The planet was captured by the Word Bearers in late M41. Shortly after the planet was captured, members of the Blood Angels Space Marine Chapter launched an attack and freed the planet. However, these Astartes were being manipulated by Inquisitor Ramius Stele into believing that their battle-brother Arkio was the reincarnation of Sanguinius, in an attempt to lead them to swearing allegiance to the Gods of Chaos.
Ryza	Ryza is a Forge World of the Imperium.[2a] Ryza is a dusty planet known for its many dunes, acidic rivers, and low-orbital industrial platforms. Due to past and present invasions, many Ork remnants dwell on Ryza's surface and have established techno-barbarian realms that scavenge for machinery. For all of this Ryza remains unbowed, and their Priesthood is known to take great delight in unleashing ancient arcane machinery upon their foes. They treat each new engagement as an opportunity to test data and weapons. Its many testing grounds for the planets famed arcane weaponry has transformed its surface into a blasted landscape. Ryza is a formidable world, known for its plasma weapons and laser weapons and vehicles mounted with them, such as the feared Leman Russ Executioner (which is no longer produced by any other Forge World)[2b] and the Stormblade Super Heavy Tank (which was first developed on Ryza).[2c] The Forge World is home to the Titan Legion known as the Legio Crucius (a.k.a. the Warmongers).[2a]
Graffias	Graffias is a Jungle World. In their pursuit of the Word Bearers Chaos Lord Zymran, Librarians of Captain Kruger's Ultramarines Company sensed a great disturbance in the Warp, coming from Graffias. Investigating the world, the Ultramarines discovered and later killed a powerful Sorcerer, as well as the Chaos forces he had gathered.
Kaledon Hunters	The Kaledon Hunters are Imperial Guard Regiments hailing from the Imperial world of Kaledon. The complex warrior clans of Kaledon are an invaluable recruiting ground for the Imperial Guard and the Kaledon clans contribute several of the toughest, though least disciplined, regiments in the Imperium. Each Regiment is drawn from a single clan and the Kaledoni Regiments inevitably fight all the harder to prove their superiority over a regiment recruited from a different clan.
Idyll	Idyll is a Shrine World of the Imperium. In 424.M41, the Battle Sisters of the Order of the Bloody Rose who defended the Shrine World were overrun by the Skullsworn Warband and their Daemonic allies.
Drook VI	Drook VI is located in the extreme north of Segmentum Obscurus, and is the homeworld of the Drookian Fen Guard regiments. The world is covered almost entirely in bogs and mist-shrouded swamps. The only Imperial presence on the planet is a handful of cities, so that the population is governed almost completely by their own laws, except when, once per generation, they are called to recruit men for the Imperial Guard — the famous Drookian Fen Guard. The Drook natives live for the honour of their clan names, and see any foreigner as an enemy that has hardly any right to continue breathing. The clans wage constant wars with each other, conducting raids on the ancestral territories of their neighbours, murdering, and looting everything that can be carried on the backs of the hairy riding beasts called rekhorns.
Exterminatus	"What is the loss of a single life when set against a galaxy of misery? What is the cost of a soul? How do we weigh its worth? The truth is , we do not. We cannot. Because to comprehend such a thing is to walk the path towards madness. To understand all that we have lost – all that we have yet to lose – is a burden even the strongest of us could never hope to bear."- Johan Francois, On the Eve of Exterminatus. Exterminatus extremis is the obliteration of a world's entire population through some form of weapon used from orbit or nearby space. Exterminatus is the most extreme method of dealing with some form of heresy, corruption or alien infiltration which has taken root within a planet's population. Accordingly it is only used in the most extreme of circumstances, when the level of corruption a world bears is so monumental that it cannot be wiped out by any other means. The destruction of the entire population is deemed necessary to prevent the contagion from spreading further.
Malek Vos	Malek Vos is a Death Guard Chaos Lord. He was originally a Captain of the Death Guard Legion during the Horus Heresy and had command of the Cruiser Balefire. Vos was among the Death Guard who were corrupted by the Destroyer Plague, after they entered the Warp to take part in the Heresy's Siege of Terra. It was a part of a trap unleashed by First Captain Typhon[2a] and when the Death Guard's fleet later emerged into the Sol System, they were thralls to the Chaos God Nurgle.[2b] He would survive Heresy and went on to form his own Warband. Vos would later ally his forces with the Daemons under the command of the Nurgle Daemon Prince The Fly Lord, in order to invade the Imperium world of Arthas. Despite the intervention of the Black Templars Marshal Armante and the Lastrati Crusade, Vos and The Fly Lord defeated the Imperium's forces defending Arthas and claimed it in Nurgle's name.
Ecovoria	Ecovoria was a Forge World of the Imperium. Upon Ecovoria, the spider-like figure known only as "the Gnarling" became a popular bogeyman used to scare the manufactorum caste’s children into obedience. Tragically, a kernel of truth lurked in the legend of a subterranean monster clad in a cloak of human skin. Ten generations after the first grand-mamzel told her wards the Gnarling would steal them away, giant sinkholes appeared across Ecovoria – the secret tunnels burrowed under each forge complex were so extensive that entire portions of the planet’s crust fall away. Black-limbed Genestealer cultists boiled out of each underground warren in impossible numbers, first ripping apart the Skitarii maniples sent to quarantine each sinkhole, then attacking the wider populace. Through the carnage stalked the Patriarch that gave rise to the Gnarling myth, the leathery devotionals tied to its spine billowing in the winds of open war.
Haakonath	Haakonath, or Haakoneth, was the Homeworld of the Star Phantoms Chapter, until it was overrun by Hrud in the Death of Haakonath. The planet is described as having "shattered", implying that it was utterly destroyed by the Hrud's time distortions.

Thrown into unrest by the Shadow Crusade, Talassar was subsequently conquered by a Night Lords warband led by Mawdrym Llansahai. The Night Lords managed to convince parts of the local garrison to defect to their side,[7a] and they plundered the local Ultramarines gene-seed stockpiles to create Inductii to bolster their numbers.[7b] In 010.M31, a Blood Angels and Solar Auxilia strike force raided Talassar to recover the remaining gene-seed; this operation succeeded and greatly weakened the Night Lords presence, but the loyalists withdrew.[7a][7c] For months after the raid, Talassar fell into complete anarchy as various factions (including the surviving Night Lords) fought for control until the planet was later retaken by the Ultramarines.[7c] After the Horus Heresy, the great horde of Orks descended on the main continent of Talassar, Glaudor, threatening to destroy cities there. Following the protocols of the newly approved Codex Astartes, the Ultramarines made a series of rapid strikes and defeated the greenskins.[6b]

For nine days Horus feasted with the High Concern, the rulers of Issinium, while listening to the oral history of their world being recited for the duration of the feast before the world agreed to join with the Imperium.
Isstvan V	The planet of Isstvan V is widely known for the infamous Drop Site Massacre. Isstvan V was the site of the near demise of the Iron Hands, Salamanders and Raven Guard loyalist Space Marine Legions following a trap set by Horus. The plan essentially consisted of opposing the loyalist marines with the openly traitorous legions the Sons of Horus, World Eaters, Death Guard and Emperor's Children; followed by having the Night Lords, Iron Warriors, Word Bearers and Alpha Legion, who were believed to be loyal but were actually pledged to Horus, stab the loyalists in the back. It resulted in the almost complete annihilation of the three loyalist legions, with only a few battle brothers escaping alive, and left the Imperium severely weakened in the face of Horus' onslaught.[Needs Citation] At the start of the Horus Heresy, Warmaster Horus apparently only had three other Primarchs and their respective Legions at his side. Under his command were his own Sons of Horus, joined by Angron and his World Eaters, Fulgrim with his Emperor's Children, and Mortarion and the Death Guard. After ridding himself of all suspected Loyalist members inside the three Legions at Isstvan III, he choose Isstvan V as his command post and prepared a deadly trap for his former brothers and their Legions. The Emperor ordered the deployment of seven full Space Marine Legions against him, agonizing over the betrayal of his most beloved son. Unknown to the Emperor of Mankind, four of the deployed Primarchs and their Legions had already turned against him, forming a "fifth column" which would strike against the Loyalists at the most decisive moment.[Needs Citation]

It is known for the mining of bioluminescent bacteria from which a highly corrosive acid can be extracted. Mordant is a nocturnal world whose surface is a barren desert completely unfit for human life. The only humans living on the planet are the miners of the luminescent veins of bacteria that produce the planet's main export. These veins live on the phosphoric content of the rock, and secrete a corrosive acid that eats the rock until it is porous. This has created a vast network of caverns and interconnected tunnels. It is in these tunnels that the clans of miners dedicate themselves to the extraction of the bacterium that they farm in enormous underground vaults to obtain the most corrosive acids known to the Imperium. These extracts are much sought after by Forge Worlds across the sector where they are used industrially.
Rhorsch	Rhorsch is an Imperium Shrine World. In M41 a number of Blood Cults began infesting Rhorsch's floating temples and the Mortifactors and Raven Guard Chapters soon arrived to cleanse them from the Shrine World.

Acting quickly the Mortifactors selflessly acted as a rearguard against the Daemons, as the Raven Guard stormed the Grand Temple, which held the Blood Cults' leader, the High Bloodcaller. Led by Shadow Captain Rykas, the Raven Guard slayed the Bloodcaller and brought an end to the Heresy infecting the Shrine World.

Sergatama VI	Sergatama VI is an Imperium world and was the site of one of the bloodiest battles fought during the Great Scouring. Following the Traitor Legion's defeat on Terra, a large force of Iron Warriors, led by their greatest Champion, took refuge on Sergatama VI and wrested control of the mighty fortress known as the Jarelphi Palace from the world's rulers. The traitors soon turned the palace and the ground around it, into a nightmarish defensive bunker, before it was attacked by the Space Wolves Legion and one million Guardsmen intent on destroying them. Though the Iron Warriors are masters of siegecraft, the Space Wolves and Guardsmen soon began toppling the gates within the fortress, until only one last gate stood between them and final victory. The Iron Warriors stood firm though and repelled any attempt to topple the final gate; until the Raven Guard Legion arrived and entered the battle. To the Space Wolves shock however, the Raven Guard led heavily mutated members of their Legion in front of them, as they stormed the final gate held by the Iron Warriors. The mutated Raven Guard howled with such mindless savagery that it chilled even the hearts of the Space Wolves, as they tore down the gate and began massacring any Iron Warrior they could find. Soon the battle was over and though a few Iron Warriors had managed to escape, most laid torn apart on the floor of the blood soaked fortress. The Raven Guard departed soon after the Jarelphi Palace was reclaimed and the Space Wolves had a new saga to tell their brethren on Fenris.

Boros Prime	Boros Prime is the proud capital of the binary Boros system in the Segmentum Obscurus, the heart of its eighteen inhabited planets and twenty four colonized moons.[1a] Since its discovery, the Boros System has been heavily fortified and staunchly defended by the Imperium thanks to the strategic value of the stable wormholes that directly link it into the warp. For ten thousand years, the forces of Chaos have attempted to take control of the system, but every invasion had been repulsed until a massive force of Word Bearers assaulted and nearly conquered the system at some point in late M41. [1b] Considering its strategic value, Boros Prime is one of the most heavily defended planets in the Imperium, second only to Cadia. Its proximity to the Eye of Terror places it under the jursidiction of the Astartes Praeses , who can committ multiple Space Marine chapters to its defense during a time of need. The White Consuls, in particular, maintain a strong presence in the system, dedicating a Proconsul and a Coadjutor to rule over its some 400 billion citizens in the Emperor's name. It also boasts a formidable orbital bastion known as Kronos, a star fort of titanic proportions from the Dark Age of Technology. This monolith is the seat of the White Consuls' power, and the base from which they conduct all operations in the Boros system. Nestled amongst Kronos's cathedral spires, sensor arrays, and defense cannons lies the powerful Boros Defense Fleet, the equivalent of a Battlefleet in other sectors. Finally, and most importantly, are the wormholes that connect Boros Prime to dozens of other locations in the Imperium, allowing it to call on the entire might of the Imperial Navy should the need arise.[1a]

Palis II	Palis II was an Imperial world that was overrun by an invading army and, rather than allow such a valuable world fall to the Empire of Mankind's enemies, the Inquisition ordered an Exterminatus to be carried out.

T'ros	T'ros,[1f] formerly known as Taros (official name - Taros II), is the second of four planets orbiting the star at the centre of the Taros System and is an arid desert world.[1a] The most recent Imperial records show a population of approximatly 12,000,000 Gue'vesa (humans) and abhumans.[1a] The largest population density can be found in and around the city of Tarokeen (population - 4'000'000 citizens before the Taros Campaign).[1a] - the only city of the planet.[1g]

Eventually the forces of Bucharis were overwhelmed and forced to leave.

It lies in the T'au Empire's remote southeastern fringes, which is a vast region of largely unexplored frontier space between the Fal'shia and D'Yanoi Septs.

Fire Warriors from Tash'var make the best Breacher Teams in the T'au Empire[1b] and its finest Razorshark pilots as well.[1a] Tash'var also serves as the only bastion of aid for the young Sept Colonies that the T'au Empire has established in its frontier region. However some, like Vor'Anoth, are so far from Tash'var, that it takes sometime for the Sept's forces to reach them. This has led these colonists to become very independent and to possess a strong survival instinct.

Seidon	Seidon is a Necron Tomb World that in ancient times lay at the heart of Necrontyr expansion. Every thirty-three weeks it was programmed to send a ship out into the stars, carrying slumbering colonists beyond the boundaries of Necrontyr space. This continued throughout the War in Heaven, sending legions of Immortals to conquer instead of colonists to expand. When the Great Sleep ended and Seidon awoke once more, its rulers have continued its mission of conquest but the damage to its programming during its sixty million year hibernation has resulted in it sending ships to random destinations rather then predetermined worlds. Thus every thirty-three weeks, another legion of Immortals depart on a journey into the unknown.

Baal	Baal is the homeworld of the Blood Angels and the base of the Chapter's fortress-monastery,[1a] Arx Angelicum. Before the coming of Humanity Baal was inhabited by an unknown Xenos race. Like the future Blood Angels, they were influenced by the powers of the Warp and worshiped a golden angel and an angel of darkness which engaged in an eternal struggle within the Immaterium. The Humans of Baal would come to replace this race and become influenced by these two gods. Every time a son of Baal protects the innocent the Golden Angel grows stronger, while every time one succumbs to the Black Rage the Angel of Darkness grows stronger. When Mankind vanishes from the Galaxy, another race will take their place for these Warp entities. Millennia before the founding of the Imperium, Baal and its two moons were all but destroyed in a terrible war. Ancient viral and nuclear weapons had turned the once idyllic worlds into toxic wastelands. The survivors became scavengers, constantly moving from place to place, and warring to preserve the spoils they gathered. By the time of the coming of Sanguinius, Baal and its moons were a wasteland dominated by a tribe known as The Blood and foul Mutant hordes. Thanks to the effort of Sanguinius, the mutants were defeated and the people of The Blood came to ascendancy. Later during the Horus Heresy, Baal became a central loyalist hub under the control of Warden Arkhad. Many members of the Shattered Legions took refuge on Baal, which suffered an extended Siege by traitor forces during the war.

A beacon of faith, Kathur was a memorial to an Imperial Saint of the same name. Hearing of Kathur's fate and unwilling to allow a symbolic defeat, the Imperium pulled back several regiments from the front line of the Black Crusade, which had originally been tasked to retake Cadia.

This single export draws Chartist Captains and those with the right Warrant of Trade. The planet has drawn investigation by the Ordo Xenos due to the Feral Ork infestation though no extant archive exists that describes a prior war that could have caused the infestation. As Waaagh! Grimtoof gets closer, the Feral Ork population becomes more aggressive and “cleansings” must be carried out with ever greater frequency.

The Highlanders were granted the planet and eventually settled there, their descendants forming the ruling class of the world.
Phyrr	Phyrr is a Death World and a Penal World in the Calixis Sector. Explorator teams discovered Phyrr a few decades after Lord Militant Angevin finished conquering the Calixis Sector, part of a massive effort by Sector Governor Drusus to survey and catalogue the Imperium’s newest domain. From space, Phyrr looked like a glimmering, blue–green jewel, with pristine oceans, rolling sun–warmed plains, and lush forests with a breathable atmosphere. Though the water of Phyrr is pure and the air clean, every plant and animal on the planet is completely lethal to human life. If ingested, a handful of spores can kill a full grown man within an hour, and a bite or sting from any of the planet’s indigenous creatures slays more quickly than that.

As fighting stalled and casualties mounted,[1b] corruption and apathy would grow amongst their ranks amid the horror and a schism would eventually occur. Blessed by Nurgle, the Moebian 6th traitors would be victorious, and the 6th would then bring these blessings back to their beloved homeworld, Atoma Prime. With a black sun and several moons casting odd reflections, the light conditions across Nox Alpha are unusual, with many zones subject to sporadic periods of shifting blackness.[2g] The planet often shifts into total darkness[1a] and the winds carry dangerous, noxious air.[2a] Breathing the air of Nox Alpha without a rebreather, can result in a condition referred to by Moebian soldiers as 'Lungers' Cough' and sometimes the winds carry sicknesses that result in truly gruesome deaths.[2a] One such sickness bloats the abdomen of a person until they burst in a shower of maggots and gore. Another fetid sickness, dubbed Nox Pox, can decimate an entire garrison of soldiers.

Dalthus	Dalthus is a Mining World in the Calixis Sector. The miners are known for their gaudy trinkets and charms.
Tranquility-II	Tranquility-II is a Feudal World of the Imperium. Lying in the Maelstrom Zone, the planet has suffered attacks by Dark Eldar raiders, Ork pirates, and Cultists since M38. However with the aid of the Mantis Warriors, the planet saw the destruction of the Dark Eldar reavers in the Scourge of the Slave Lords.
Aquillius	Aquillius was an Imperium Cardinal World that was destroyed in an invasion by the Ork forces of the Warlord known as The Beast.
Jilator's Star	Jilator's Star is in Imperial world, that is suffering from a Genestealer Cult infestation. Currently, Canoness Superior Junith Eruita and the Sororitas of the Order of Our Martyred Lady are fighting to cleanse the world.
Chaspia	Chaspia is a world of the Imperium. For the better part of three hundred years, Chaspia was a contested planet. Within three days of landing in the warzone, the Redemption Corps stormtroopers, blew up the Augusta-1 Shale Plant, depriving fuel to the blighted war machine of Fatherlanders. Within a year, the planet was back in Imperial control.
Sortiarius	Sortiarius, the Planet of the Sorcerers, is a Daemon World and the current homeworld of the Thousand Sons Chaos Space Marine Legion. Once located deep in the Eye of Terror, it was brought into Realspace with a ritual culminating in the Siege of the Fenris System. At the conclusion of the Battle of Prospero, Magnus the Red used his sorcerous powers for a last-ditch master spell, transporting the surviving warriors of his Legion through the warp to another planet, one promised to them as sanctuary. The Planet of the Sorcerers orbited around a constantly changing star, an unstable orb that passed through nine different waning and waxing phases.[6a] When the Thousand Sons first arrived on the planet, they found it unpopulated. Over thousands of years of raiding, they have acquired a multitude of minions. This has created a servant underclass, some of which have escaped their masters into the hostile land. These escaped servants then often join the nominally independent nomadic warbands upon the Planet of the Sorcerers, led by powerful mortals risen from the ranks of the escaped servants. Often, these mortal champions arising among the warbands are then recruited back to serve the Thousand Sons. Individuals with psychic powers are much sought after by the Thousand Sons to act as servants, becoming known as thrall wizards, psykers bound to the service of particular sorcerers. Also notable is the amount of beastmen arisen upon the planet, a subordinate population group that developed over thousands of years. While some of these abhumans — specifically referred to as tzaangors — enter various warbands, most remain wild. Little is said of flora or fauna, apart from the presence of chaos hounds amongst some warbands and other Chaos creatures (see below).[6a] Random bands of Heretic Astartes periodically appear on Sortiarius, sometimes from time periods unfamiliar to the Thousand Sons themselves. There are also bands of cultists roaming the planet.[6b]
Torian	Torian is an Imperial Agri World, located in the Chinchare sub-sector of the Segmentum Obscurus.

Totha	Totha is an Imperium world that is a source of Rough Rider Regiments.
Nihilakh Dynasty	The Nihilakh Dynasty is a Necron Dynasty which ventures little outside its own domains. The Nihilakh Dynasty itself is based from the Crownworld of Gheden[1b] under the command of the Phaeron Krispekh. It is keenly traditionalist by nature, which has led the Triarch Praetorians to hold an honoured place within the Dynasty. During the ancient past, the Nihilakh built vast treasure worlds filled with the wealth plundered from a thousand lost civilizations. It is said that these treasures eclipse those of all the other dynasties combined, and their armament attests to this. Arrogant and proud, the Dynasty flaunts its wealth and military strength but has become protective of their treasures to the point of isolationism. Whilst its isolationism is beneficial to alien races, it also carries a peril. Undepleted from wars of military expansion, the Nihilakh viciously act against any interloper. If attacked, they do not rest until the aggressor has been utterly destroyed.[1a] Thanks to the preserved head of an ancient alien prophet, the Necrons of the Nihilakh are able to predict the future and strike at a foe when they are least prepared. Recently, the Nihilakh have ended their policy of isolation and have begun a campaign of expansion from their borders. They have also recently sided with Szarekh, the last Silent King, and hope to oversee Necron domination of the Galaxy.
Celetradia	Celetradia is an Imperium Shrine World that was successfully defended from an attack by armies of heretics by the combined forces of a Black Templars strike force and the Sisters of the Order of the Ebon Chalice.
Hredrin	Hredrin is a Hive World in the Calixis Sector. It is home to Gaolist Astropaths. Some nobles from here, called Hallmarshals, are known to wield Shock-Staves. The Cult of the Divine Savour preach tithing to the God-Emperor as both a mark of gratitude for success and a sacrifice to ward off misfortune. Also known as the Tithe of Weal and Woe. The Hredin 32nd Regiment and 6th Hredrin Infantry are Imperial Guard units hailing from this world.
Jan van Yastobaal	Jan van Yastobaal was a contemporary of Confessor Dolan Chirosius during the Plague of Unbelief.[1a] Yastobaal was an impetuous and restless young man, and the clan head of a wealthy estate on Chiros, until it came under attack from Bucharis' forces. He instigated the resistance against Bucharis on Chiros, then went on to fight Bucharis' tyranny on worlds such as Guryan, Dolsia and Methalor.[1a] After the death of Bucharis, Yastobaal's restlessness led him to become a Rogue Trader. Yastobaal and his followers became fabulously wealthy as they discovered and plundered alien worlds and ancient civilisations. He soon became the most infamous rogue trader in the Imperium. His methods became more and more at odds with his reputation as a man of the people, and his followers began deserting in droves, alarmed by his violent mood swings and his insolence to danger. Eventually, cut-throats and renegades were all that remained of Yastobaal's once proud contingent, and their mission had become one of simple plunder rather than exploration in the Emperor's name.[1b]
Elnath	Elnath is an Jungle World of the Imperium. In their pursuit of the Word Bearers Chaos Lord Zymran, Captain Kruger's Ultramarines Company received word that Zymran's Word Bearers had begun construction of a base on Elnath's volcanic surface. Striking quickly the Ultramarines killed the Word Bearers and destroyed the base's power generators, ensuring Elnath was protected from the predation of Chaos.
Altid Crusade	The Altid Crusade was a campaign waged by the Imperium against Fallen-led rebels in M38. At the start of the Altid Crusade, the Dark Angels fought alongside the Astral Claws, a highly-honored albeit younger Chapter. What subsequently happened is unclear, however, but the Astral Claws were recorded as being entirely destroyed in 288.M38. In truth, the Chapter survived, but spent the following centuries in obscurity and possibly on a Penitent Crusade. Eventually, the crusade attacked a planet called Altid 156 in 299.M38. The world had seceded from the Imperium and was home to millions of pilgrims. The crusade council ordered one Imperial Guard regiment to the planet, but rescinded the order when the Dark Angels insisted on assaulting the world themselves. The assault force was extreme for a world of pilgrims, but the Dark Angels knew that there was a Fallen among the populous. The Ravenwing sought out and pinned down the forces surrounding the enemy main base before the Deathwing teleported into the building. It was here that they met the Fallen they had been searching for, Elucidax the Keeper or to the Dark Angels, "Zeriah", former captain of the Dark Angels 14th assault company during the Great Crusade. He killed a dozen Dark Angels before he was near mortally wounded. He was transported back to the Rock where Asmodai extracted a confession leading to the capture of Zeriah's entire warband, but Zeriah refused to acknowledge his sins for joining the rebellion with Luther and as such languishes alone in a cell.
Bethelius	Bethelius is an Imperial Cardinal World, that has been invaded by the Black Legion in M42. Though it now lies in ruins, the Adeptus Custodes are fighting to save the world.

Dead in the Water (Audio Drama)	Dead in the Water is an original audio drama by Sandy Mitchell, produced by the Black Library, featuring Commissar Ciaphas Cain. It was first published on June 7, 2011. The production was performed by Toby Longworth and directed by Lisa Bowerman. When Commissar Ciaphas Cain is sent to a river-world, he must deal with a dangerous enemy, an enemy whose true identity remains unknown. Amberley Vail of the Ordo Xenos presents a brief extract from the Cain Archive, selected from the period of Cain's career as an independent commissar (before his posting to the Valhallan 597th).
Karkariad	Karkariad is a planet in the Sabbat Worlds which was occupied by the forces of Chaos. During the Sabbat Worlds Crusade, Karkariad was one of several planets targeted in the opening phase of Warmaster Macaroth's ambitious campaign to reach the Cabal Systems, commenced at the end of 765.M41. Similar to the fiasco on Oscillia IX, the Imperial offensive devolved into a grinding, bloody attrition, and largely for the same reason: the incompetence of the theatre commander, Lord General Lugo, recently promoted to high rank by Macaroth. Lugo's actions at Karkariad's hive cities prompted the convening of a board of inquiry, making Lugo desperate to win a clear victory before the Warmaster removed him from the general staff. To that end, Lugo manoeuvred to be given theatre command on Hagia.
Bantor III	Bantor III is an Imperial world that has been invaded by the World Eaters, though the Legion of the Damned have since come to its aid.
Tygress III	Tygress III is a Feral World in the Calixis Sector.

U-6743	U-6743 is a world of the Imperium. It was one of the planets on the route that Ingvar Orm Eversson of the Space Wolves Chapter took after concluding his tour of service with the Deathwatch to return to his homeworld, Fenris.
Janus Darke	Janus Darke was a Rogue Trader. He traveled with Eldar Farseer Auric Stormcloud to the Crone World Belial IV.[1b] Janus Darke was born on Crowe's World,[1g] about a thousand light-years from the Eye of Terror.[1f] He was an orphan, apprenticed to the trading houses, and attended Mission Schools on the planet.[1g] Darke grew up with tales of the Great Crusade and the Age of Exploration, which filled his head in his youth. He was obsessed by the idea of frontiers, and hungered to transcend limits, and see places shunned by the Imperium. By nineteen years old, Darke was a clerk in the office of Imperial Trader House Sansom & Sansom when the planet was attacked by Orks. The planet's corrupt Governor died while attempting to flee, and the Planetary Militia's officers were killed, so, despite only having basic Militia training, Darke rallied the Milita, and then the defenders of Crowe's Town, holding off the Orks long enough for the Blood Angels to arrive and break the siege.[1f] He became a hero, and his talent for leadership was recognised by the senior partners of Sansom & Sansom, who quickly gave him successive promotions. Darke felt driven to overcome his lowly background,[1f] and painfully learned to imitate the accent of the Imperial upper class.[1e] He soon convinced Sansom & Sansom to give him command of a trading ship and a force of Mercenaries, and they underwrote his application for a Rogue Trader's charter, and the cost of his first voyage. This was a sweep through the Draconic Arm, with Simon Belisarius as his ship's Navigator. During this voyage, he brought ten new worlds into the Imperium, agreeing monopoly treaties with their rulers, which, together with trade goods, allowed him to repay Sansom & Sansom more than ten times their investment. Darke made enough to buy a 50% share in the ship Star of Venam, and impressed Simon Belisarius enough for him to become Darke's business partner, and raise the remaining money from House Belisarius.[1f]
Thruscas Sine	Thruscas Sine was a Human world brought down by Nurgle. Heretically progressive under Imperial law, in a single generation the world managed to eradicate all natural illness from its population. This proved to only offend Nurgle, and in an act of revenge he infested the planet with hordes of Plaguebearers, Nurglings, Rot Flies, and Great Unclean Ones.
Uzarn	Uzarn is a world of the Imperium, known for its drear stone prairies.
Tusk	Tusk is a name given by Orks to a world at the heart of Undred-Undred Teef.[1b] There may once have been an indigenous population on what is now Tusk, but it is long dead, any ruins of its existence ground to dust or torn apart to build the heart of an enduring Ork Empire. Here greenskin ranks are thickest and the battle between them is fiercer than on any other. Powerful Warbosses and Freebooter Kaptins gather here to test their mettle in the greatest fight in the Expanse. With every passing cycle of conflict, the number of bosses grows fewer, and those who remain are more powerful and grow to ever greater size.[1b] Tusk is a world of factories and workshops, scaffolds and shipyards unceasing in their labours, producing weapons, vehicles, and starships for the Orks in vast quantities. The industry on Tusk has spread across the planet like a plague of fire and iron, the only remaining open spaces on the world serving only as testing grounds for new inventions and battlefields for restless greenskins (or both).
Corphyra	Corphyra became an Imperium world after it was brought into compliance by the Word Bearers Legion during the Great Crusade.
Dolsene	Dolsene is a planet located in the Ophidian Subsector. The Planet was the site of the last major engagement of the Ophidian Suppression.
Derdoni	Derdoni was a Hive World of the Imperium. In 936.M41, the planet withheld its Tithe from the Adeptus Terra, resulting in an Departmento Munitorum investigation team escorted by Death Korps of Krieg troops landing on the planet to investigate its insubordination. After the Munitorum officials were hanged, the Krieg forces deployed in the towering mountains that overlooked the planet's primary Hive, launching a fierce artillery bombardment of the city' spires. Trapped inhabitants attempting to flee were mercilessly cut down by the Guardsmen. After five years of relentless shelling, the hive surrendered. Ignoring this, the Krieg bombarded the city for another five years, despite the fact that all signs of life within the city had ceased after only three.
Vorenz-VI	Vorenz-VI is an Imperium Penal World whose entire population was enslaved by the Void Dragons Eldar Corsairs.
Garalon Prime	Garalon Prime was an Imperium world, until it was invaded and the population there killed by the Word Bearers and World Eaters Legions as they traveled to invade the realm of Ultramar during the Horus Heresy.
War of the Beast	The War of the Beast, also known as Waaagh! The Beast, was an enormous Ork Waaagh! first encountered by the Imperium in 544.M32. Waged by the Warboss known only as The Beast after he succeeded in uniting much of the Ork race, his Waaagh! was the largest the Galaxy has ever seen and rampaged across the Imperium, eclipsing even the one Horus defeated during the Ullanor Crusade which earned him the title of Warmaster. The largest war fought by the Imperium since the Horus Heresy, humanity only halted his advance at great cost and desperate measure, devastating the Adeptus Astartes. By mid-M32, the Imperium was in a state of relative peace and prosperity. Having recovered from the devastating Horus Heresy, the Traitor Legions were still reeling from their defeat inside the Eye of Terror, Xenos were relegated to the frontiers of Imperial space, and the stagnation and decay that would define the Imperium millennia later had not yet set in. Confident that humanity had endured its greatest challenge, the Orks in particular were underestimated and judged to have been removed as a threat since the Ullanor Crusade. Under the powerful Lord High Admiral of the Imperial Navy Lansung most of the Imperial Fleet was dispatched to humanity's borders, far from Terra.[2a] This underestimation of the greenskins would prove to be disastrous upon the world of Ardamantua in Segmentum Solar, just an estimated six weeks Warp travel from Terra. There, the entire Imperial Fists Shield Company battled the Chromes, insectoid aliens seemingly in flight of another, worse threat. The planet soon became wracked by gravitational storms and geological disturbances as the Chromes made their last desperate attack on the Imperial lines. The Imperial Fists were soon decimated, their fleet lost, and Chapter Master Cassus Mirhen died at the hand of the Chromes in a desperate battle.[2b] Realizing the disaster facing Terra, a rescue operation led by Lord Commander Militant of the Imperial Guard Heth and the remaining Imperial Fists Chapter, including the 50 Wall Brothers, was dispatched.[2c] The source of the disturbances became clear when an enormous Ork planetoid began to materialize into Ardamantua's orbit, laying waste to the reinforcement fleet.[2d] On Ardamantua, the surviving Fists under First Captain Algerin, Second Captain Koorland/Slaughter, and Captain Sauber/Severance, with a handful of Guardsmen allies, waged a desperate struggle against the panicked Chromes and escalating gravity anomalies as the Greenskin planetoid seemed to phase in and out of reality as it drew closer to full materialization. Soon after, massive Orks began to land on the planet and killed the remaining Imperial forces, which had somehow arrived from what the Imperials would dub "Subspace".[2e] After dispatching a message that the Imperium faced a threat like none before, Heth's fleet was destroyed along with seemingly the entire Imperial Fists Chapter. The Imperium estimated that the Attack Moon would next move on Terra itself.[2f]
Yrnax	Yrnax is a world of the Imperium. The planet fell under the sway of a xenos-worshipping cult, which took a joint effort by the Doom Eagles and the Deathwatch to destroy. Such was the cult's fanaticism, that the entire population had to be killed. The ragged remnants of the Doom Eagles' campaign standard used in the operation, was later remade into the Shroud of Yrnax and gifted to the Deathwatch.
Thandos IV	This article or article section is based on information from a Fanatic Press publication such as Fanatic Magazine or one of its predecessors (e.g. The Citadel Journal, Necromunda Magazine, etc.). These publications regularly featured articles submitted by hobbyists, and as such, their content may or may not be in contradiction to established background lore. Thandos IV is a world of the Imperium.
Tyran	Tyran is a dead world in the Ultima Segmentum. In 745.M41, it was the site of first contact between the Imperium and the Tyranids, and is the source of that alien race's name. Tyran was an unimportant Imperial-controlled Ocean World to the galactic south-east of Ultramar, in the Eastern Fringe, 60,000 light years from Terra. The planet was home to an Adeptus Mechanicus Explorator Base, Tyran Primus, that studied the unknown sectors at the edge of the galaxy,[1a] and was manned by no more than a few hundred Explorators at a time, governed by Magos Varnak of the Cult Mechanicus. Eighty percent of the planet's surface was composed of turbulent oceans, their depths populated by an array of sea life ranging from colossal krakens to minuscule cuttlefish. In 745.M41, Tyran would become the first battleground between the Imperium of Man and the Tyranid swarm. Previously, the Explorators on Tyran had detected several nearby worlds whose atmosphere and biomass had mysteriously vanished; shortly after this, Tyran itself became the target of the ravenous alien race responsible. The resulting invasion left the planet a barren dead world, later rediscovered by Inquisitor Kryptman. The alien species received its name from the events.[1a]
Norada VII	Norada VII is an Imperial world. The world is currently part of major warzone between the Astra Militarum and Traitor Guard. Under the leadership of Lord Castellan Ursula Creed, armies of Cadian Shock Troopers and Kasrkin were deployed to dozens of systems in the region. At Norada VII they narrowly avoided becoming encircled by traitor forces, only to watch as their transport ships were deployed in orbit by Chaos Space Marine vessels.

Angered that the Inquisitor would not allow him to return to his Chapter during the Invasion of Rynn's World, Geoffros gave into heresy and madness by slaughtering anyone he could find in the undercity.
Brobdigal	Brobdigal is a living Imperial Death World of fleshy mountains and dank organic swamps. Its fauna acts as the world's immune system, however, and Brobdigal considers the Imperials upon its surface to be an infection. Because of its nature, the Imperium would likely have quarantined or purged Brobdigal, if only out of xenophobic disgust, but for the fact that the world also grows Organo-Crystals. These are perfect for use in the focusing emitters of the Imperium's Astropathic shrines. Brobdigal was created by the Games Workshop employee Andy Clark and appeared in White Dwarf 481.
Eypharos	Eypharos once held an Imperium colony, until 540.M38 when it was invaded by Eldar forces of Craftworld Biel-Tan. The Flesh Tearers Chapter later came to the colony's aid, but in their unrestrained eagerness to destroy the Eldar, they unleashed incendiary bombs on Eypharos. Though the tactic ultimately led to the defeat of Biel-Tan's forces, it destroyed the world's forests and left its rivers poisoned.
Barbarus Prime	Barbarus Prime was a Mining World on the fringes of the Tarsis Ultra System. Before its destruction, its main focus was on the minerals mined there, which mainly consisted of precious metals and gems, but which also included metals used in the hulls of starships. It had a very small population of around 9,000, which were mainly located in scattered villages and towns in the planet's eastern mountain ranges.[1a]. Barbarus Prime was the first planet in Tarsis Ultra's system to be invaded by Tyranids during the defence of Tarsis Ultra; the population held out for about a week, aided by updrafts from plains ajacent to the eastern mountain ranges which blew the Mycetic Spores into the mountains. The population also used their firearms, ranging from ancient rifles to autoguns to the lasguns of the PDF.[1b] Ultimately, however, they held out long enough for the Imperial fleet to arrive and watch Barbarus Prime being consumed.[1c]
Drisinta	Drisinta is an Imperial Civilized World.
Kol	Kol is the innermost of the seven planets of the Signus Cluster.[1a] Formerly a small Imperial Mining World, it was conquered by a Chaos cult of Slaanesh sometime before the events of the Signus Campaign.[1b] It was left quarantined alongside the rest of the system after the campaign was finished.[1c]
Catechism of Hate (Novella)	Catechism of Hate is a limited release novella by Black Library, and the eighth novel in the Space Marine Battles Series. It was written by Gav Thorpe and published in January 2012. Among the hallowed ranks of the Adeptus Astartes, few have attained such renown as Ortan Cassius – Ultramarines Chaplain and Master of Sanctity. Hero of the first Tyrannic War, his name is legend. When the hive fleets target the world of Styxia, Cassius leads the defence, marshalling the Ultramarines against the xenos monstrosities.
Paragon	Paragon is homeworld of the Emperor's Hands Space Marine Chapter.

Baedros	Baedros is an Imperium Shrine World. It once contained the Echospire, until several Harlequin Masques combined into a Grand Masque, in order to topple it. Though they were successful, the Harlequins earned themselves the undying enmity of the Space Wolves Chapter, whose honour was besmirched by the bloody disaster they have caused.
Illiun	Illiun is a high-gravity Imperial world, that contains a convent of the Sisters of Silence and is the Homeworld of the Sister Erynia.
Decimius	Decimius is an Imperial world that was the site of numerous battles during the Pyrus Reach Conflict. During one such battle an Eldar force launched a surprise attack on the Imperial forces defending Decimius, but they were easily defeated. In the aftermath of the attack, a bizarre Xenos artefact of unknown origin was discovered, which seemed to have been what the Eldar had been after. After the Imperial forces reported their finding, the Xenos artefact was later taken by Inquisitor Juri Duron to be studied.
Karadox	Karadox was visited by an Imperium expeditionary force, who attempted to reclaim Archaeotech treasures located on the world, but were soon brutally attacked by the Harlequins of the Masque of the Midnight Sorrow.

Londal Minor V	Londal Minor V is an Imperium world that was saved by the Wolf Lord Bran Redmaw's Great Company when it was invaded by the World Eaters Chaos Space Marines.
Confederation of Light	The Confederation of Light was a religious order of the Imperium founded on the world of Dimmamar and a major rival to the Temple of the Saviour Emperor and later the Adeptus Ministorum.[1a] The Confederation of Light emerged sometime after the Horus Heresy and like the Temple of the Savior Emperor, the dominant order of the Imperial Cult, worshiped the Emperor as a God. However, the Confederation believed that the sacrifice of the Emperor should serve as an example to everyone and advocated ideas of poverty, generosity, and humility, ideas that directly contradicted the teachings of the Ecclesiarchy and its Cardinals who lived lavishly[1f]. By M32 the power of the Ecclesiarchy over all other religious orders of the Imperium was absolute and the Confederation posed the only threat to its power. To curb the percieved threat of the Confederation to the Ecclesiarchy's power, the Ecclesiarch managed to pass a unanimous vote of the High Lords of Terra approving the first War of Faith[1f]. The Confederation of Light was declared a heretical organization and the forces of the Imperial Guard and Imperial Navy invaded Dimmamar to eradicate this "spiritual threat". Though some of its followers managed to escape, the Confederation of Light ceased to exist as a powerful force within the Imperium and the dominance of the Adeptus Ministorum was now absolute.[1b] However in M36 during the Age of Apostasy, the Confederation of Light would reemerge. This time, the order was led by Sebastian Thor and declared that the Master of the Administratum and Ecclesiarch Goge Vandire was a traitor. As a result of Vandire's Reign of Blood, mismanagement of the Imperium, and oppressive policies the new Confederation of Light under Thor found widespread support and entire Sectors backed the charismatic young preacher.[1c]
Cyclopea	Cyclopea is a civilised Forge World in the Calixis Sector. and the capital of the Cyclopea System. A world of dust and debris, Cyclopea's barren surface strewn with the faded remnants of some long extinct civilization. These relics take the form of megalithic monuments raised by unknown masons in ages long past, and no one can tell whether the builders were even human, though no sign of Xenos lingers. Many of Cyclopea’s settlements are built using the ruined megaliths. The people of Cyclopea are known to be every bit as morbid as the world of their birth, as if touched by some aeons-old soul-curse. They are grim and dour and they shun even those few pleasures others might cleave to in a universe of oppression and war. As with their neighbor Sinophia, numerous tech-heresies have sprung into being, nurtured by the tinker-witches who skulk in the deep shadows of the towering megaliths. Tithes manufacturing and the processing of a variety of bulk ores instead of manpower. With recent upheavals, the Departmento Munitorum has dispatched several Imperial Guard Regiments to prepare it for full scale, regimental tithes.
Avar III	Avar III is an Imperium world, which has a privileged class that spends a great deal of time on horseback. They while away their leisured hours with equestrian sports and hunting.
Beublghor	Beublghor is a Daemon Prince of Chaos. Commanding large legions of Bloodletters, his physical appearance is that of a titanic armoured leech with a Warp Portal in place of a head. At some point prior to early M40, he slaughtered the human population of Cocholos (which had originally been a Necron Tomb World) and claimed the planet as his lair, transforming it into a lifeless orb and burrowing into its core. When the Necrons of the Oltep Dynasty finally awoke on Cocholos in 052.M40, they battled Beublghor in the Corewar. However, in the end, Beublghor was able to obliterate the Necrons and still rules his world.
Cadmus Phosp	Cadmus Phosp contains several Pylons, which drew the attention of Archmagos Cawl to the world in early M42. Cawl is on a quest to reproduce the Warp negating abilities of the Pylons, which led him to invade Cadmus Phosp to study them. This caused a battle to erupt there, but Cawl's forces were victorious. Afterwards, though, Cawl discovered the world's Pylons had become so degraded they no longer functioned and so he left Cadmus Phosp, to start his quest again.
Norcarmos V	Norcarmos V is an Imperium world located in the Calixis Sector.
Vostroyan Firstborn	The Vostroyan Firstborn are Imperial Guard Regiments from Vostroya, formed from the firstborn sons of every family on the planet.[5a] Vostroya is a world in the Halo Zone beyond the Eye of Terror, which swore allegiance to Mars during the Age of Strife. It is now ruled by a committee of Techtriarchs, a mix of Mechanicus Magi and more traditional Imperial planetary government. During the Horus Heresy, Vostroya refused to provide regiments to the Emperor, preferring instead to reserve the population in the manufactoria blanketing the world. After the Heresy, the Vostroyans, out of guilt, agreed to supply every family's firstborn son to service with the Imperial Guard.[5a] According to Vostroya's Offering of the First Born, the eldest son of every family must enlist in the Regiments. This is to atone to their sin for failing to provide troops to the armies of the Emperor during the Horus Heresy. There are no exceptions to this law, which applies even to the Techtriarchs and the most noble families.[5a][12a] For most Vostroyans, it is an honour to join the Firstborn, as great importance is attached to the payment of the debt owed to the Emperor millennia ago.[5a] For this reason, having no male firstborn is regarded as a major issue for noble Vostroyans, as many old noble houses put great importance in their family's military service. Their devotion is such that when Vostroya was cut off from the rest of the Imperium by the Great Rift in M42, more Vostroyan Firstborn regiments were raised and sent into the void mostly blind, hoping to reach war zones as to assist other Imperials who were calling for help. Many of these expeditions were lost due to the Astronomican being dimmed in the Imperium Nihilus, yet the Vostroyans have vowed to never again wait when they are called to war, so they still send their forces into the void.[12a]
Cadian Shock Troopers	The Cadian Shock Troopers are Regiments of the Astra Militarum originally from the fortress world of Cadia before its destruction. Located at the edge of the Eye of Terror, Cadia formed the first line of defence against Chaos incursions, such as the Black Crusades. Because of this, Cadia was one of the most strategically important planets in the Galaxy, and the entire population was militarized to some degree.[4a] Though their home planet was utterly sundered, the resolve of the Cadians has not been broken. Veteran survivors of the last battle for Cadia, along with regiments of their kinsmen scattered across war zones throughout the galaxy, now fight even more doggedly against the enemies of the Imperium. Whole generations of Shock Troopers are born, raised and trained en route to war zones, and soldiers from other worlds with the mettle to withstand Cadian training are inducted into their ranks. The mantra ‘Cadia Stands’, which was oft repeated during the planet’s final violent days, has gained purchase within the officer corps and amongst the platoons. For Cadia does indeed stand, as long as a single Cadian soldier continues to fight.[14b] The Cadians are widely regarded as some of the best troops in the Imperium, short of the Space Marines themselves. Their reputation is so great that many other worlds base their own Imperial Guard regiments' equipment, force organization, and methods of war upon those used by the Cadians.
Honours (Short Story)	Honours is a short story by James Swallow. It was published online in December 2012 as part of the Black Library Advent Calendar (2012). A Blood Angels captain reflects upon his many years of service and the honours he has accumulated, recounting the campaigns in which they were earned.
Eden Prime	Eden Prime was an Agri World of the Imperium. In late M41, it was destroyed inadvertently by Ork Warboss 'Eadcrumpa after the Warboss accidentally breached a containment core of Necron Doomsday Cannons he had acquired on the Tomb World of Suranas.
Crucis	"Considered the "second world" of the Moebian Domain, Crucis is a large shrine world, and a popular destination for pilgrimages."[1a] Crucis, also referred to as Holy Crucis, is a core-world of the Mobian Domain. Crucis has continually served as a bastion of Imperial authority and stability in the Moebian Domain, alongside the more powerful Atoma Prime. Crucis is the seat of power for the Ecclesiarchy in the Moebian Domain.[1b] In the many cathedrals and chapels of the world, the mixed smells of smoke from candles and incense with a just a hint of blood from self-flagellation is commonly encountered.
Hypnoth	Hypnoth was a Forge World of the Imperium. In 585.M40, it was the site of a vicious Eldar attack after the Imperial Fists delivered the captured Iyanden warship Blood of Khaine to its shipyards. In 911.M41, it fell in the Siege of Hypnoth to the Necron Sautekh Dynasty under Imotekh the Stormlord. The Necrons released a technophagic virus that destroyed the Adeptus Mechanicus defences and ultimately led to the planet's dramatic fall. Lector Dogmatis Videx would witness the planet's fall and subsequently harbor a fanatical desire to destroy the works of the Xenos due to the horror and rage he felt from witnessing the world's annihilation.
St. Astrid's Fall	St. Astrid's Fall is a Frontier World in the Calixis Sector. It is a moon orbiting the gas giant Sekmet. Considered a blighted planet. Before 710.M40, the inhabitants were reduced from 18,000,000 to 11,000.
Sylphis II	Sylphis II is an Imperial world. In early M36, Sylphis II was invaded by a massive Ork horde and a distress call was sent out for aid. It was luckily received by the then Chapter Master of the Ultramarines, Ollonius, who dispatched a strike force led by Captain Calistes which purged the Greenskins from the world.
Azoras	Azoras is a world of the Imperium. An Inquisitor cabal of the Ordo Malleus saved the planet when they defeated the Tzeentch daemon Cerbalus. Cerbalus was bound to Inquisitor Mortmain, as a daemonhost soon after.
Vaxanide	Vaxanide is a Hive World in the Malfian Sub-Sector, Calixis Sector. Vaxanide is a poorly supplied, desperate world that sits at the edge of the Calixis Sector struggling to enter the "inner circle" of sector planets. Lawlessness prevails in the frontiers outside Hive Vaxanhive. Vaxanide has been besieged at least twice in its history. The First Siege of Vaxanide occurred in 410-412.M41 by an Ork raider fleet. The Second Siege of Vaxanide was in 507.M41 this time by Orks aboard the Space Hulk Pinnacle of Savagery. Both times Battlefleet Calixis drove away the invaders.
Hydraphur	Hydraphur is a Forge World as well as the administrative and fleet capital of Segmentum Pacificus. Orbiting Hydraphur is the massive Star Fort Ascendant as well as massive shipyards which ring the world. These artificial rings, while not as large as those on Luna or Mars, serve as the fleet base for Segmentum Pacificus. However the world itself is divided into several spheres of influence. The Imperial Navy holds sway in the atmosphere and above, while on the surface the Ecclesiarchy rules in uneasy conjunction with the Adeptus Mechanicus. During the Plague of Unbelief, Hydraphur surrendered to the rebel forces of Cardinal Bucharis, to the lasting shame of its subsequent generations. After Hydraphur's return to the fold of the Imperium, Cardinal Chye Balronas instituted an annual religious festival characterized by fasting and penitent observance.[2a] Another legacy of the Plague was the Administratum's attempt to curtail the power of the Imperial Navy in the system. Although the Hydraphur system was a centre of Fleet operations, the administrative presence of the Ecclesiarchy and the Inquisition were increased, while the landholding Naval families on Hydraphur were gradually relieved of their possessions. However, the success of the partition was mixed: although the primary authorities on Hydraphur itself are the Administratum and the Ecclesiarchy, the Navy responded by tightening its control over the rest of the system and subsector[2b], to the point where the Ecclesiarchy on Hydraphur found it necessary to use covert couriers to communicate with its fellows in other systems.[2c] The Navy also formed close ties with the mercantile families on Hydraphur, such that their syndicate ties were regarded as family associations.[2b] Due to the strife on Hydraphur during the Age of Apostasy, the world was ultimately divided between the Navy, Ecclesiarchy, and Mechanicum thanks to reforms overseen by Balronas.[2a]
Fedrid	Fedrid is an Imperial Feral World, its thick forests are so dense and so teeming with dangerous carnivores that access is forbidden without a license. Fedrid is a particular favourite of game hunters and those individuals procuring animals for the Imperial arenas.[1b] Saint Quivvar Nog of Fedrid hailed from Fedrid.[3f] The planet also has a stable Warp route to Sepheris Secundus.[1c] The forest world of Fedrid holds the dubious distinction of having a huge population of large predators, making the beasts of that world particularly fierce and perpetually hungry. The dangers are legion, ranging from the tiny but insidious flesh boring rot worms, to lurking pit-biles hiding beneath the loam with snapping jaws like mantraps, to thorn-back reptiles the size of Imperial Guard battle tanks.[3c] There are predators on Fedrid that would think nothing of consuming a Land Raider whole.[3e]
Garaghak's World	Garaghak's World is a former Imperial Hive World. Originally known as Forsarr it was a capital of Forsarr Sector. Forsarr was besieged in 705988.M41 by Orks of Waaagh! Garaghak. Millions of Orks were deployed in an epic conflict, known as the Siege of Forsarr. Known battles of this war include the Siege of Succuro-Prime Hive in 296994.M41 during which the 227th Mordian Iron Guard Regiment was eliminated in a ten-day battle with Garaghak's forces; and the elimination of Wakskum's Dakkaboys in 870995.M41 on the 89th Parallel by Raven Guard strike force, lead by Shadow Captain Kayvaan Shrike. The world eventually fell in 411996.M41. It was renamed Garaghak's World and the Warlord now calls himself 'Warlord of Forsarr'. This defeat made the whole sector indefensible for the Imperial Guard High Command and the Guard forces began to retreat en-masse, abandoning the Forsarr Sector despite Ecclesiarchy complaints. In 995999.M41 Orks of Waaagh! Garaghak are mustering on Garaghak's World to continue their war against the Imperium.
Megheim	Megheim is a Hive World of the Imperium. Home to a staggeringly massive population, the entire surface is encased in towering Hives.
Ullanor Crusade	The high point of the Great Crusade. The culmination of decades of war. The beginning of the end, we used to think. But we did not realise what that meant, how true those words would be. Such hope, such greatness, was the height from which we fell. Here we built the tallest pinnacle before the deepest drop. If only the orks knew what ruin they wrought here. - The Primarch Vulkan, M32.[8b] The Ullanor Crusade was a vast assault upon the powerful empire of Ork Overlord Urlakk Urg during the Great Crusade in 000.M31. It is remembered as Horus's greatest victory while he was still loyal to the Emperor and the act that earned him the title of Warmaster. It was the last battle of the Crusade where the Emperor personally led his forces. While the Ultramarines and White Scars Space Marine Legions, supported by newly-raised Imperial Army regiments, were tasked to retake the outlying planets of the Ullanor system, the Luna Wolves under Horus had their fleet drove straight for the central world. The force was massive: one hundred thousand Space Marines, eight million Imperial Army troops, and hundreds of spacecraft.
Clove	Clove is a Hive World in the Calixis Sector. It is the home to the 23rd Drusus Dragoons Imperial Guard Regiment who spend their days in prayer to the saint when not in battle. The seat of power of the Hazeroth Sub-sector Arch-Diocese of which Dantius of House Landsholt is Cardinal. Known to refine the drug Scav-Glysten[5a] and is primarily fed by the Agri-World Hesiod's Wake.[5b]
Titan (Moon)	Titan is a moon of Saturn, in the Sol System, located in Segmentum Solar. Titan contains the fortress-monastery of the Grey Knights, which is made entirely of basalt. In pre-Imperial times, Titan was part of the Saturn polity which was defended by the Saturnine Fleet. Titan, along with the rest of Saturn and its moons, were eventually absorbed into the fledgling Imperium during the early Great Crusade.[Help] Later, under the orders of Malcador the Sigillite, ships and supplies were quietly siphoned off other projects and covertly sent to Titan under the code name Othrys. These shipments were discovered by Administratum Scribe-Adepta Second Classificate Katanoah Tallery when she was processing cargo shipping through the Riga Orbital Plate over Terra, and she believed that they represented a Horus-backed plot to undermine the Imperium via the Departmento Munitorum. An attempt to alert others to the discovery caused her to be hunted, but she was rescued by Nathaniel Garro who believed her story about a possible threat to the Imperium. He was aboard the plate searching for Saint Keeler, and Tallery's devotion to the Lectitio Divinitatus persuaded him to her honesty.
D'akhar	D'akhar is an Imperium Death World whose population live and work beneath its lethal radiation-blasted deserts. A heresy-fueled rebellion once swept over the entire world, but the Blood Angels Chapter arrived and destroyed the traitors, bringing order to D'akhar once more.
Drookian Fen Guard	The Drookian Fen Guard are the Imperial Guard Regiments from the bog-covered world of Drook VI. They are predominantly light infantry, although there are a number of light cavalry squadrons, and are known for their scouting and infiltration abilities. The regiments' home world, Drook VI is covered almost entirely in bogs and mist-shrouded swamps. The only Imperial presence on the planet is a handful of cities, so that the population is governed almost completely by their own laws, except when, once per generation, they are called to recruit men for the Imperial Guard. The people of Drook live for the honour of their clan names, and see any foreigner as an enemy that has hardly any right to continue breathing. The clans wage constant wars with each other, conducting raids on the ancestral territories of their neighbors, murdering, and looting everything that can be carried on the backs of the hairy riding beasts called rekhorns.
Colchis	Take me from my home, and I will sail to the stars of your empire. I will serve as a son must serve. But let Colchis stand as I have shaped it: a planet of peace and prosperity. Colchis was the original homeworld of the Word Bearers Space Marine Legion. After the Horus Heresy, it was bombed into submission from orbit, and because of its unique geological makeup, the entire planet fractured and exploded. The planet's location is a secret guarded by the Inquisition. Colchis was a massive world, three times larger than Terra. It took 4.8 Terran years to orbit its sun and 170.4 Terran hours to rotate once around its axis, giving it an extended day-night cycle to which humans could not adapt; thus, the Colchisian civilizations developed a unique method for keeping track of time. With this extended solar day, time was broken up into seven sub-days, known as Dawnaway, Mornday, Long Noon, Post-noon, Duskeve, Coldfall, and High Night. These sub-days are further divided into three segments (wake-rise, wake-main, and rest-eve) to correlate more closely with a Terran day. The hottest time of day on Colchis is wake-main of Long Noon, and the coldest is rest-eve of High Night.
Framlingham	Framlingham is known for raising the Framlingham Rifles Imperial Guard Regiments.
Eridos	Eridos was the site of a battle between the forces of Slaanesh and the Eldar.
Luyten's World	Luyten's World is a world of the galaxy, known to have been the site of a battle involving the White Scars.
Arthas	Arthas was once a world of the Imperium, before it was invaded and conquered by the forces of the Death Guard Chaos Lord Malek Vos and the Nurgle Daemon Prince, The Fly Lord. During its invasion by the forces of Nurgle, the Black Templars' Lastrati Crusade, led by Marshal Armante, came to aid the Imperium's forces defending Arthas. Due to their efforts Arthas remained free from Nurgle's grasp for sometime, but they suffered heavy causalities as a result, while fighting the Death Guard and Daemons, and they soon found themselves the only resisting force remaining on the planet. They fought on alone until Armante was killed in the battle and with his death, all hope of saving Arthas was lost; though the remaining Black Templars refused to escape the planet, without the Marshal's body. With their time running out, the remaining Black Templars were led into battle by the Emperor's Champion Horst and the Chaplain Ferdinand, as they ferociously fought the Death Guard and Daemons that stood in their way of reaching the area where Armante had fallen. Unfortunately for the Crusade, the forces against them were personally led by Malke Vos and The Fly Lord who destroyed the Black Templars, and with their defeat claimed Arthas in Nurgle's name.
M'khand	M'khand is a Forge World of the Imperium. M'khand is the homeworld of the Legio Venator (Iron Spiders). The forges of M'khand are known for their production of Chimera variants equipped with turret-mounted Heavy Flamers and Malcador Heavy Tanks.

The Doomed Ones are their holy warriors, who do their dark lord's bidding. A group of recruits take the trial to join this elite group, braving a dangerous labyrinth full of devious traps and monstrous creatures. Only one can survive, and only the most cunning and brutal can be that one.
Angelus Subsector	The Angelus Subsector is a old part of the Scarus Sector. It is part of Segmentum Obscurus.[1a]
Nekthyst Dynasty	The Nekthyst Dynasty is a Necron Dynasty. During the Necron Wars of Secession[1a] the Nekthyst Dynasty had earned a widely known dishonorable reputation. Their Phaeron, Oblis the Enslaver, angered the Triarch by refusing to adhere to their decrees. Thus, when the Nekthyst crownworld of Moebius was assaulted by Orks, the Triarch refused to send aid. Though the Orks were repelled, Moebius was devastated along with much of the Nekthyst empire. After that day, the Nekthyst exchanged their traditional gold and purple heraldry colors to blackened copper, turning their backs upon the Infinite Empire. They relentlessly defend their fractured realm, resorting to any means—no matter how deceitful—to accomplish their goals. They scornfully reject the so-called grand vision of Necron dominion over the galaxy, and other Necron dynasties see them as little more than untrustworthy savages, with few Phaerons willing to treat with them, let alone trust them.[1a]
Avellorn	Avellorn is an Imperium Hive World that was once invaded by the Iron Warriors during the Horus Heresy.
Fenimore	Fenimore is an Imperial world. Fenimore is orbiting the gas giant 88-Clavia. During the War of the Beast in M32 due to the Ork Attack Moon appearing near the gas giant, the planet's previously beautiful rings were shattered and shards of ice and stones fell to Fenimore, cutting the screaming inhabitants to bloody ribbons.
Delta Arbuthnot	Delta Arbuthnot is an Agri World of the Imperium. Disaster struck the world, when a Alpha-level psyker forced the entire population of Ratling serfs to rise up against the landowners in an orgy of bloodshed. The White Scars Chapter would later assist in putting down the rebellion.
Drachu	Drachu is a Hive World of the Imperium.
Martyrs of Thor	The Martyrs of Thor are an Imperial cult that originated from the world of San Sebastian in early M38. Believing to be descended from Sebastian Thor himself (despite his well-known chastity), the Martyrs of Thor were a suicide cult which maintain that only through the ultimate sacrifice could humanity be accepted by the Emperor. They believed this so strongly that they thought even unbelieving Imperial citizens should die in a great conflagration that would please the Emperor. Unfortunately the Cult ended up being a victim of its own success, its founders having killed themselves in a series of suicide bombings only a few years after they had formed. With none left to carry on their teachings, the sect eventually died out.
N'dras	N'dras is a Tau sept established during the Second Sphere of Expansion. For reasons known only to the Ethereals, this world was voluntarily abandoned by the Tau.[1a] The few remaining Tau are regarded as untrustworthy and generally of quick temper and brooding countenance. N'dras is regarded by the Tau as a eerie and strange world, with the Earth Caste constantly reporting strange readings emanating from it.[2a] The remaining Earth Caste scientist work there under the strong Fire Caste protection and their purpose is veiled in secrecy.[2b]
Ichtar IX	Ichtar IX was a Mining World of the Imperium. In 161.M32, the planet was cut off from the greater Imperium for nine centuries due to a great Warp Storm. When the storm ended and contact resumed, nothing remained of the twenty million miners who had made up its population. The planet is now devoid of all intelligent life, the victim of the Daemonic legions of Chaos while trapped within the Warp Storm.
Mortikah VII	Mortikah VII is the current homeworld of the Guardians of the Covenant Space Marine Chapter. Their adopted base of operations, the planet lies near the western rim of the Imperium and is home to the Guardians' mighty Fortress-Monastery, that is so massive its cathedral spires rise into the clouds.

Andromeda (World)	Andromeda is an Imperium world that was brought into Compliance by Warmaster Ryse's Deucalion Crusade.
Colony World	Colony Worlds are worlds that contain Imperial colonies, which have been established with the aid of the Departmento Colonia.
Weapons Platforms#Manticore Platform	Weapons Platforms are heavy weapons used by the Imperial Guard. Unlike their self-propelled cousins, these platforms must be towed into position, typically by their own dedicated transport which doubles as an ammunition carrier. These platforms are commonly used to defend command posts, forward supply depots, or reinforce battlefield strongpoint. Each Earthshaker Platform mounts the same Earthshaker Cannon found on a Basilisk, on a standard cruciform platform. They are one of the most common weapons used in artillery companies, especially during prolonged static campaigns where they can stay in the same position for weeks battering the enemy. Normally dug-in far to the rear, on occasion an Earthshaker will be brought forward for direct fire in support of friendly forces. Each one is crewed by a team of five Guardsmen in order to keep up a good rate of fire; in a pinch a minimum crew of four can suffice, although this is less than ideal. Only the Trojan support vehicle is powerful enough to tow this platform into position. Each Earthshaker Platform normally has its own Trojan to move it, and also to carry extra ammunition during the prolonged fire missions.[5a] Using standard 5 powder charges, the Earthshaker can reach out to approximately 16, 20, or even a 100 km with a 38 kg shell. The Earthshaker Platform is also capable of engaging aircraft, operating under the name of Basilisk Anti-Aircraft Gun.
Artemia Majoris	Artemia Majoris is an Imperium Forge World.[1a] It was the scene of the Hieronymite Heresy[1a] when the Hieronymites (followers of High Magos-Alchemys Hieronymus) were outlawed and eventually eliminated for their experimentation into prescribed bio-chemical compounds.[1b] During the Fourth Tyrannic War, Artemia Majoris was isolated by the Shadow in the Warp. A Solblade strike force led by Captain Euclysto of the Sons of Medusa Chapter responded after detecting the Forge World's distress summons, but it was determined that the Tyranids' numbers were too great for a conventional engagement to be successful. Instead, a number of tech-magi and relics were evacuated from Artemia aboard the Strike Cruiser Warcog.
Belial (Hive World)	Belial is a Hive World of the Imperium. It was the origin of the 7th Belial and thus the birth world of Guardsmen Lemuel, Antoniev, Ivan,[1a] and Saranin.[1b]
Camgia	Camgia is a Xenos World home to the Zygo Warriors. The planet has suffered multiple Imperial invasions over the last 500 years, but each has been defeated.

White Dwarf 112 (UK)	White Dwarf 112 UK
Galan V	Galan V is an Imperial world that was the site of the Treachery of Galan in M35. During that incident, several warships of its garrison fleet mutinied under the lead of the Retaliator Class Grand Cruiser Foebane. The resulting battle saw four of the traitor vessels destroyed at the cost of three Imperial Cruisers. In the battle on the planet, that known as Galan V Suppression, on the Ammonium Cobalt wastes fought some Imperial Guard Armoured Regiments of unknown origins consisted of at least a couple of Leman Russ Vanquisher and Salamander Scout Vehicles.
Emperor's Blades	The Emperor's Blades is one of the most ancient sect of Death Cultists that existed within the Imperium of Man. They communicated by a intricate form of sign language and its masters or mistresses constantly trained its follower in the ritual form of death blows developed by the cult. Hiring member of the Emperor's Blades requires at least one phial of blood to be taken from each of the Death Cultist's victims and sent to their temple where it is devoted to the Emperor of Mankind. Some of their members can undergo special ardous rituals with the Officio Assassinorum. Atleast one member was hand picked personally by Canoness Selena Agna of the Order of the Sacred Rose to serve under her during the Kaurava Campaign.
Delaphina	Delaphina is a Hive World of the Imperium that was raided by the Blood Gorgons Warband.
Formal Prime	Formal Prime is a Hive World in the Sabbat Worlds Cluster, which was occupied by the forces of Chaos. Formal Prime was one of the few Imperial holdouts in the Sabbat Worlds, having fought to maintain itself in the wake of the region's invasion by the forces of Chaos. During Operation Redrake, the initial phase of the Sabbat Worlds Crusade, Formal Prime was one of the four objective worlds chosen by Warmaster Slaydo for the Crusade force's initial advance into the Chaos-held territory. Of these four, Formal Prime was the most strategically important, thus Slaydo chose to command the assault in person.[1a] Slaydo initially estimated that it would take six weeks for Formal Prime to fall, but reckoned without the difficulty of the terrain, or the competence of the enemy commander, Shebol Red-Hand, who commanded a core of soldier-fanatics known as the Charismites. The attacking Imperial Guard forces became bogged down in the labyrinths of Formal Prime's hive cities; at one point, it was calculated that two hundred Guardsmen were dying for every metre of ground taken.[1b]
Imperial Munitorum Manual (Background Book)	The Imperial Munitorum Manual is a Warhammer 40,000 background book written by Graham McNeill in 2007. It is written in the style of both a training manual and a military weapons catalogue, and features entries on weapons, kit and equipment utilised by the Imperial Guard, as well as details about the organisation that provides it, the Departmento Munitorum.
Hieronymite Heresy	The Hieronymite Heresy[1a] was a heretek movement perpetrated by High Magos-Alchemys Hieronymus of Artemia Majoris.[1b] Hieronymus and his followers, the Hieronymites, conducted a series of investigations involving proscribed biochemicals[1b] in an attempt to develop improved ammunition for use by Imperial forces.[1c] Mechanicus officials found Hieronymus guilty of innovation and declared him a heretek.[1b] He was later terminated on orders from the Fabricator-General.[1c]
Ekklestis	Ekklestis is an Imperial Industrial World, that was invaded by the Necrons' Novokh Dynasty in M42. However the Adeptus Custodes' Dread Host came to the world's aid and destroyed the Xenos.
Sabbat Worlds Crusade	The Sabbat Worlds Crusade was the Imperial effort to liberate the sector of the same name in the Segmentum Pacificus, began officially in 755.M41.[1b] The sector began to suffer sustained Chaos persecution in the years following 600.M41, and the situation worsened for the Imperial residents and military forces, until, by the year 740, the entire sector could no longer be considered under Imperial governance, and the Civitas Imperialis was formally suspended.[1a] The Sabbat Worlds largely fell under the control of so-called "Archonate", a Chaos-aligned state/coalition led by an Archon who presided over various warlords.[8a][8b] The task of retaking of the sector was eventually given to Lord Militant Slaydo, who had petitioned the High Lords of Terra for the mission at the successful conclusion of the Khulan Wars in 754.M41. Slaydo had always been a passionate admirer of Saint Sabbat, and considered it disgraceful that the Imperium had so passively accepted the loss of the worlds conquered by her. He had been drawing up theoretical approaches for the reconquest of the Sabbat Worlds as early as 737.M41. After the Khulan Wars were concluded, the High Lords of Terra rewarded Slaydo with a promotion to Warmaster and a formal charter to re-take the Sabbat Worlds.[1b]
Leviathan	Hive Fleet Leviathan is the largest and greatest Tyranid Hive Fleet to invade the Galaxy. It attacked in 997.M41 from the galactic south. Unlike the majority of previous Hive Fleets that attacked from the Eastern Fringe, Leviathan instead skirted under the galactic rim of the galaxy and then pushed upwards through the galactic plane, spreading its forces across a broad front that covered the Ultima Segmentum, Segmentum Tempestus and even into the Segmentum Solar. Leviathan's strategy was to form its forces into two giant tendrils hundreds of light years apart in such a way that it stretched the Shadow in the Warp over the vast distance between the two tendrils, stopping all psychic contact between the trapped worlds and the Imperium and also blocking Imperial reinforcements from navigating the Warp towards the beleaguered worlds.[1d] One of Leviathan's main tendrils, which was on a projected course directly to Terra, was eventually stopped at Tarsis Ultra. However, Leviathan as a whole remained undefeated and continued to assault the galaxy. Leviathan consumed countless worlds. In response, the Imperium is reinforcing entire Systems, raising thousands of armies and dispatching dozens of Space Marine Chapters to troubled areas; meanwhile, several Craftworlds of Eldar used ancient destructive weaponry to reduce planets to Dead Worlds, and the Tau developed new technologies and weaponry to combat the Tyranids.[1d] Thanks to the formation of the Great Rift, much of Leviathan was cutoff as it made its main assault on Baal, homeworld of the Blood Angels. Most of Leviathan was destroyed during the period known as the Blackness against the defenders of Baal, the Indomitus Crusade, and newly materialized Daemonic armies.
Mis'bah	Mis'bah was the site of a battle between the Eldar and the Battle Sisters of the Order of the Bloody Rose.
Stonekraal	Stonekraal is a lightly inhabited Frontier World of the Imperium, lying on the north-eastern fringes of Ultramar. In late M41, it was the site of the Relief of Stonekraal during the First Tyrannic War. The bleak planet, abandoned by the greater Imperium, was nonetheless saved by the Exorcists from Genestealer forces due to a navigation error that many attribute to divine intervention.
Avarax	Avarax is an Imperial Hive World, that contains over 90% of the Recidious System's population. The planet Avarax has 2 moons, the closest being Demerium and furthest being X_0020.[3c] The world is a juggernaut of industry, that contains cities and logistic hubs which span entire continents. Almost the entirety of Avarax's surface is devoted to manufacturing and transport, which has left the Hive World to be mostly covered in ferrocrete and plasteel. The biosphere of Avarax has collapsed into a desert wasteland with frequent sandstorms due to the hive cities' excessive industry and exponential over-exploitation of the planet's natural resources. Because of this, Avarax is forced to rely on food shipments from the nearby world Kadaku to keep its population fed and industry supplied with promethium so the Hive World can continue functioning. However this became a liability, when the Recidious System was invaded by Hive Fleet Leviathan and then the Thousand Sons in M42. Both worlds were attacked by the Tyranids and Traitor Legion, but Avarax began suffering food shortages, as the invasion had disrupted Kadaku's shipments to the Hive World. This caused an outbreak of Cannibal Cults to occur as the Ultramarines Chapter's 2nd Company and the Cadian 8th Regiment defended Avarax. Even as its population struggles to survive, the Adeptus Mechanicus has shifted as many of the Hive World's manufactorums as possible to military production, in order to keep the Ultramarines and Cadians well supplied. Adding to the woe the Hive World was facing, was the strange inaction of Avarax's Planetary Governor and its nobility, during the invasion. This has outraged the Cadian 8th's commanders and has caused them to suspect that a Genestealer Cult is responsible or that the Tyranids' Lictors have carried out a decapitation strike. The Inquisition though, suspects the Thousand Sons are responsible for the Governor and nobles' lack of resistance. This has led Inquisitorial retinues to be sent to Avarax, in order to seek out any possible corruption that has been caused by the Traitor Legion.
Flijghof	Flijghof is an Imperium world that once rebelled, before the Imperium's forces invaded and reclaimed the world for the Emperor. Among the forces that ended the rebellion were the 9th Necromundian Astra Militarum Regiment and the Fire Wasps Titan Legion.
Taro Primus	Taro Primus was the site of a battle involving the forces of the Eldar.
Vardan Rifles	The Vardan Rifles are Imperial Guard Regiments.
Tareska	Tareska was once a prosperous Imperium trading world, until a living shadow began wreaking havoc on the world during the Second Tyrannic War. Over the course of several weeks, Tareska's key governmental and military figures were brutally slaughtered by the shadow, which would attack from nowhere before vanishing. The few terrified officials left still alive quickly locked themselves in underground bunkers and fortified strongholds, leaving Tareska without any leadership. Now finding themselves ungoverned, and without an organised military to enforce order, Tareska population rioted and the world began to fall apart. At the height of food riots, however, the Bio-ships of Hive Fleet Kraken suddenly appeared and obliterated the world's meager defense fleet (though what became of Tareska is unknown).
Ephisia	Ephisia is a Hive World of the Imperium, and the site of the Ephisian Atrocity. When a nearby cluster of worlds rebelled against the Imperium, Ephisia was used as a staging ground for millions of Imperial Guard to put them down. As the Guardsmen were preparing to board transport barges to take them to their ships, disaster struck when disguised cultist psykers launched a coordinated attack. Throughout the gathered Guardsmen, the pyskers rose to the air and cast a psychic storm, that turned into an inferno and engulfed the Guardsmen below them, despite dozens of the cultists being shot down. When the storm cleared, an army ready to reclaim worlds had been turned into piles of twisted metal and ash. It would later be discovered by the Imperium that the Alpha Legion member Phocron had been behind the attack, as well as the rebellions on the nearby worlds.
Athonian Tunnel Rats	The Athonian Tunnel Rats are Imperial Guard Regiments from the Imperial world of Athonos.[2a] Governance of Athonos is vied for by dozens of rival families. The resultant gang warfare - fought in the streets and sewers of the hydroponic gardens - is brutal and unending. Such is the recruiting ground for the Athonian Tunnel Rats. They are masters of urban combat and amongst the most determined close-quarters fighters of the Imperial Guard.[2a]
St Jedask's Haven	St Jedask's Haven is an Imperial Mining World, that is currently being invaded by the Black Legion. While the Adeptus Custodes have come to defeat them, the Traitor Legion's Daemonkin forces have caused a Warp Storm to appear around them. The Master of Possession who leads them is drawing power from it and the Warp Storm is also causing an upheaval in St Jedask's Haven's heavily mined bedrock.
Sixty-Three-Nineteen	Sixty-Three Nineteen was the nineteenth world to be brought back under Imperial rule by the 63rd Expeditionary Fleet under the command of Warmaster Horus during the Great Crusade.[1c] Third planet of nine that orbited a yellow sun, Sixty-Three Nineteen was ruled by a self-appointed "Emperor", who claimed it to be Terra itself. He therefore reasoned that he was the rightful ruler of mankind, and as such he demanded that Horus' forces bow to him instead. After the initial embassies sent from the 63rd Fleet were met with violence, Horus had no choice but to conquer the world by force.[1a] With the removal of the false Emperor, the human population of the planet bitterly accepted their new role as citizens of the Imperium.[1f] After the main battle General Rakris was assigned as a Lord Governor Elect of Sixty-Three-Nineteen.[1c] Some small resistance did continue however, with several cities on the western continent holding out for brief periods and scattered pacification actions required on three other planets in the system. The most serious incident of non-compliance occurred in the Whisperhead Mountains range and lasted for around three months, but this last pocket of resistance was eventually excised by the Luna Wolves' 10th Company.[1e] Sixty-Three Nineteen had a high-tech martial element and at least 3 new STC patterns were recovered from it.[1d]
Arcadia Secundus	Arcadia Secundus is a world of the galaxy. At one time there was a Chaos Cult uprising on the world. Inquisitor Amberley Vail fought against the Cult, despite it falling outside of her usual remit.
Regallus	Regallus was a Hive World of the Imperium. The Crimson Sabres Chapter fought there with eldar pirates raiding its hive spires.[2a] The planet's Hives were enormous, astonishing even a seasoned Space Marine. Later, the Crimson Sabres returned to the planet as the fallen Chaos Space Marines of the Crimson Slaughter during Abaddon the Despoiler's 13th Black Crusade; Regallus was invaded by the forces of Chaos and laid to ruin.[2b]
House Makabius	House Makabius was a Knight House of the Imperium during the Great Crusade that sided with Horus during the Horus Heresy. Originating on the world of Baroda in the Coronid Deeps, House Makabius achieved supremacy during the Age of Strife in 831.M30 when it vanquished the rival House Wentorth and ended the world's eight hundred year civil war. Shortly after, Baroda made contact with the young Imperium but chose to resist, which resulted in its swift defeat by the Imperial Fists in the Battle of Arben Moor. The House pledged loyalty to the Imperium thereafter under the patronage of the Forge World of Mezoa. However due to the poor state of the House and bureaucratic slowness in their upgrading process, the Knights of Makabius saw little action in the Great Crusade and could only brood on their defeat while hearing of great victories being won by the forces of the Imperium elsewhere. Nonetheless a few Knights saw deployment as Freeblades, where they quickly gained a reputation as courageous shock troops and siege-breakers. One of these scions was Markan Hrotham, who gained the favor of Ezekyle Abaddon. Shortly before the Drop Site Massacre, Markan returned to Baroda with a message from Warmaster Horus promising glory and revenge for the neglected House. He was rejected by the ruling council of Lords of Baroda, but Markan undertook a coup with younger Knights which was successful. After seizing power, he launched a bloody purge against loyalists of the planet. Thereafter, House Makabius pledged itself to the Warmaster. Increasing the House's strength from two dozen to nearly two hundred Knights, they left Baroda shortly after, being deployed by traitor forces in the Battle of the Coronid Deeps under the command of the Death Guard.

Green Kroosade	The Green Kroosade (or Green Krusade) is a massive Ork Waaagh! that has engulfed the Scarus Sector in the wake of the 13th Black Crusade. It was originally orchestrated by elements of the Night Lords and Alpha Legion in order to provide the forces of Chaos with mercenaries. The sudden rise of the Orks posed a new and unexpected threat to the Imperial defenders. Currently the Green Kroosade is holding the planets Lethe Eleven and Mordax as well as most of Imbrium and Ulants. Gudrun and Nysa Stromolo are on the brink of anarchy and only the intervention of the Black Templars and Salamanders could prevent the Orks from claiming Thracian Primaris and Enaur Delta. The overall situation in the Scarus Sector is grim and there seems to be no halt to the green tide.
Second Sphere of Expansion	The Second Phase of Expansion (018.M39- ~700.M41[1b]) was the second major phase of expansion for the Tau Empire, launched with the advent of the ZFR Horizon Accelerator Engine, which finally allowed the Tau to achieve long-range space travel.[1a] With a faster fleet and armies bolstered by new Kroot allies, the Ethereal Supreme, Aun'Wei, declared a new phase of expansion ready. The campaign was launched from each of the new Septs established during the First Sphere of Expansion. In 053.M39, the Vespid were successfully integrated into the empire while in 393.M39 N'dras was colonized.[1b]. In 576, the first Battlesuits, the T-series prototypes, were deployed by the Tau.[1b] It was during this time that Commander Puretide achieved legendary fame for the Tau, scoring victories that led to the establishment of Septs such as Tash'var and Elsy'eir. Puretide went on to thwart an Ork invasion that threatened Au'taal. The last breakthrough of the Second Sphere of Expansion was the successful crossing of the Damocles Gulf, something that led to first contact with the Imperium. The destructive wars with Humanity that followed were unlike anything the Tau had experienced and brought an end to the Second Sphere of Expansion.[1a] New Septs established during the campaign included Au'taal, N'dras, Ke'lshan, Elsy'eir, Tash'var, Vash'ya, and T'olku.[1a] During the Second Sphere of Expansion, the Tau Empire encountered Hive Fleet Gorgon, the greatest threat the Tau had yet faced.[1a]
Signal to Noise (Short Story)	Signal to Noise is a short story by C.Z. Dunn. Travelling aboard a warship of the Black Templars, Sister Agentha of the Adepta Sororitas Orders Dialogus finds that her skill with languages is required when the vessel intercepts an ancient message, potentially dating back to the dawn of the Imperium – and containing the voice of the Emperor Himself.

When they learned of its fate, the surviving Krandorian Guardsmen vowed to exact revenge against the followers of the Chaos Gods.
Macharia	Macharia is an Imperial Shrine World in Segmentum Pacificus. It was originally known as Donia. It is most famous for being the homeworld of Lord Commander Solar Macharius and the site where he began his famous Macharian Crusade. Originally known as Donia, upon Macharius' rise to power it was renamed by him to Emperor's Gift and again in the latter stages of the Crusade to Emperor's Glory. After Macharius' death, it was again renamed Macharia in his honor and became the Lord Commander's resting place. Spoils from the Macharian Crusade made Macharia fabulously wealthy, a status it still enjoys today. Macharia is comparatively easily reached by the Warp for inexplicable reasons which the Ecclesiarchy heralds as a miracle and proof of the Macharius' status as a saint. The planet is covered in marble buildings and shrines, the largest of which can be seen by orbit. Massive numbers of pilgrims, zealots, and beggars inhabit the world, which are kept in line by Frateris Militia. Despite is grandeur and wealth, Macharia's lower levels are nonetheless known to a dark impoverished underbelly nicknamed the "shame of Macharia".

Gothic Sector	The Gothic War was Abaddon's 12th Black Crusade which saw the ravaging of the Gothic Sector and the capture of two Blackstone Fortresses. In the lead up to the Gothic War during 142.M41, a cataclysmic shockwave passed through the warp and the entire sector was engulfed in a warp storm cutting it off from outside help. Battlefleet Gothic, the Imperial Navy Battlefleet of the Gothic Sector, fought against many Chaos fleets led by individual Warmasters - estimates vary from eight to twenty or more Chaos fleets present, each capable of rivaling an Imperial battlegroup - as well as pirates of the Eldar and the unconfirmed presence of a Craftworld, Ork pirates, and also human pirates. The death toll on both Imperial and Chaos sides ran into the millions; planets were invaded and recaptured and bases attacked all the while the sector was isolated from outside Imperial help.[1c] In 151.M41, almost ten years later, did the warp storms finally begin to abate allowing reinforcements to arrive. With an alliance between the Imperium and the Eldar, Abaddon's fleet was located and pursued to the Schindlegeist system where the deciding battle of the war took place, seeing Abaddon beaten. It wasn't until 160.M41, almost twenty years after the start of the war, that the sector recovered its planets and trade routes from the threat of remaining Chaos fleets, pirates and Orks.[1c]
Drondii	Drondii is an Imperial world.
Inwit Cluster	The Inwit Cluster, also known as the Inwit System, is a closely grouped together series of Ice Worlds, that belong to the Imperium.[1a] Among them, is Inwit which was the Homeworld of the Imperial Fists' Primarch Rogal Dorn. He would rule the Inwit Cluster, until Dorn was rediscovered by the Emperor in 835.M30 and left it to take part in the Imperium's Great Crusade[1a]. Inwit then became the Homeworld of the Primarch's Imperial Fists Legion and it was for this reason, that it was targeted by Warmaster Horus' forces during the Horus Heresy. The Inwit Cluster would be attacked as well, in a campaign that lasted for four years. Furthermore, A vast Traitor fleet led by elements of the Emperor's Children wrought terrible destruction upon the region. Eventually, however, the Siege of Terra drew the Traitors away from the Cluster, though, a string of its worlds were left as burning wastelands.[1b]

Though the Alpha Legion was able to evacuate its entire forces, the 67th Expedition Fleet had been forced to leave half of its forces behind in its desperate escape from the doomed world. Despite this, the Primarch Alpharius was able to convince the 670th's Lord Commander, Teng Namatjira, that its aid was needed to defeat a major threat to the Imperium, located on 42 Hydra Tertius. Namatjira was eager to remove the stain, Nurth had left in his otherwise impressive campaign record and forcibly conscripted several Imperial Army Regiments and warships, that were on Empesal.

In 007.M31 it was attacked by three World Eaters chapters as part of the Shadow Crusade. However, the rebels had underestimated the tenacity of the Ultramarines, leaving only a single Chapter of their own to secure the warp channels of the region before departing. Within a month, the survivors of the Ultramarines force had returned, along with stragglers from the Loyalist forces fleeing the Isstvan system and other garrison forces, and set upon the World Eaters, their numbers greater than the Traitors. In a bitter campaign stalemate endured until the arrival of Dark Angels forces from the Thramas Crusade led by the Battlecruiser Fifth Horseman. In reward for their stalwart bravery, Lion El'Jonson would later decree that they could bear the symbol of his Legion, for those that fought by his side with honor would ever be truest sons. Even in these latter days, with the Ultramarines scattered by the edict of the Second Founding, there remain a few that still carry a vambrace or pauldron in the stark black of the Lion's heraldry.

Balhaut	Balhaut is a planet in the Sabbat Worlds cluster. Balhaut was one of the key objectives set by Warmaster Slaydo at the start of the Sabbat Worlds Crusade. Operation Redrake and Operation Newfound were both prosecuted with the end-goal of Balhaut in mind, and its liberation from the forces of Chaos was the ultimate culmination of ten years of fighting. The Battle of Balhaut in M41.765 was the most significant Imperial victory of the early Sabbat Worlds Crusade and saw the death of Archenemy Archon Nadzybar, but it came at a heavy cost, and Slaydo died of wounds suffered in single combat with the Archon. On his deathbed, Slaydo made the recently promoted Marshal Macaroth the new crusade Warmaster.[1a] Balhaut itself suffered badly during the battle, and an extensive programme of repairs was barely underway in M41.780 when the Tanith First and Only Astra Militarum regiment were rotated there for convalescence away from the front lines. The Tanith First's commander, Colonel-Commissar Ibram Gaunt, had fought on Balhaut while attached to the Hyrkan Regiments and achieved recognition for breaching the Oligarchy Gate and bringing down the Tower of the Plutocrat during the climax of the fighting at Balopolis.

Whilst Imperium have been committed large force to defend the planet, Eldar were dominated in the air, so small gains have been made by the Emperor's servants.[1a] The Imperium used in this conflict many Regiments, for example Valstadt 13th Armoured Regiment[2b], while the main air might of the Eldar consisted of the Nightwing fighters squadrons.[1a] In one celebrated (but carefully concealed) engagement, a massed Eldar assault in the Campaign was halted by a lone Vindicare Assassin hiding in a ruined tower. The Eldar advance in the face of this tower was stalled again and again by a hail of deadly sniper fire which slew Exarchs, Warlocks, and Support Weapons crews in quick succession. Eventually, the Eldar called in their scouts to clear the tower, but when they entered it they found it full of grenade traps ready to meet them.
Messia	The world of Messia is planet located within the Screaming Vortex, notable for the mutant hordes that roam the surface, but it's best known for its unusually long day and its desperate promethium miners. Overall the planet is a harsh, toxic Desert World where a day lasts over a year, with human habitation only within the city states of Mekonta and Zanok upon at the north and south poles, respectively. In order to heat their structures and provide basic power, these two cities constantly send teams of prospectors to travel across the planet’s surface in search of promethium. As the competing miners travel the desolate landscape, they must regularly face and overcome the massive hordes of mutants that constantly shamble across the surface, and change form with the rising and setting of the sun. Located at Messia’s north pole, Mekonta is a city whose culture is based on domination and force of arms. The majority of the city’s population are slaves, some earn the right of a chance at upward social mobility within the city’s arenas, while most must rebuild the city's day side in hellish conditions as the city is constantly breaking down from its harsh sunlight. Mekonta’s society is based largely upon its system of government and inheritance: property must be earned by every citizen, no inheritance will pass to the next generation. Once children reach the age of maturity of fifteen years, they will be exiled from their parents’ homes to either become a property owner or a slave. When an individual dies, his neighbours immediately vie over his assets; the victor claims the property and the losers often become the victor's slaves.

Sanctum	Sanctum is the homeworld of the White Templars Space Marine Chapter. A place of towering mountains, verdant plains, and techno-barbarian tribes, Sanctum is the homeworld of the White Templars. During the Fourth Tyrannic War, the Chapter acceded to it becoming one of the key Anchor Worlds of the Imperium to meet the Tyranid threat. As a result, vast swathes of the planets unspoiled wilderness were transformed into city-sized fortresses, spaceports, and supply depots. This did not bother the White Templars, who only regretted that they largely could not man these fortifications themselves as most of their strength was away on the Indomitus Crusade deep inside Imperium Nihilus. In the subsequent Battle of Bastior, Sanctum itself faced a massive Tyranid invasion from Grendyllus that was only blunted thanks to the efforts of Trajann Valoris. However, Tyranids still plague the world.
Nimbosa Crusade	When Hive Fleet Kraken began to threaten worlds on the Eastern Fringe of the Imperium, the High Lords of Terra responded by stripping the worlds on the border with the T'au Empire of Imperial forces. The T'au were quick to recognise this redeployment and soon moved to take advantage, beginning the period known as the Second Sphere Expansion.The T'au had soon annexed a whole swathe of Imperial worlds along the border. Nimbosa was one of the most important of these worlds. The T'au forces under the command of Commander Brightsword began the invasion with a landing of overwhelming numbers. They soon controlled most of the world and started a systematic extermination of the populace. The only Imperial force left able to resist after the first phase of the expansion was the Vostroyan Firstborn IX under the command of Graf Toschenko, who moved quickly to fortify the factory city of Polia. Brightsword's first thrust used Kroot to identify Imperial Guard strong points to be bombarded by the T'au armour. Kroot auxiliaries suffered heavily in the push but the strategy was successful and the T'au eventually gained a foothold in the city which then began to grow. Graf Toschenko had come to realise that the T'au policy of isolating and reducing each stronghold would soon break his hold on the city, so he authorized a counterattack, the main blow of which fell around the central Cathedral.
Lucius (Forge World)	Lucius is a Forge World and is home to the Legio Astorum Titan Legion (AKA the "Warp Runners").[1a][3b] It also is the place of origin of the Macharius-class super-heavy battle tank.[4b] The name of this world originates from Luciun, a unique alloy renowned for its durability. The war-plate and weapon of the armies of Lucius is made of Luciun, so the warriors of Lucius's forces have improved resilience against small-arms fire. A hollow world[3b] (one of the Supernatura Majoris of the Imperium[3b]), Lucius has been part of a grand experiment that should have destroyed it a dozen times over. The centre of its once-barren core is an artificial sun, a titanic fusion reactor that powers the industry sprawling above. No one truly knows how this energy source came to be, though many Tech-Priests take credit. Lucius' boundless power supply has made it a forefront of military production, producing many types of guns and vehicles. Their Ironstriders and Onager Dunecrawlers are the most bellicose of all the Skitarii legions. Their Titan Legion are the infamous Legio Astorum,[3b] whose Princeps are trained at the Clone Academy located in Lucius' Overcity.

The Morkanaut awaits...
Arx	Arx is another exit (though unstable) from the Eye of Terror besides the Cadian Gate, and has been the starting point of Black Crusades by the forces of Chaos. It was from here that Abaddon the Despoiler began the Gothic War by raiding the research and monitoring station in 139.M41. It bypasses the Cadian Gate, as such making it an attractive place from which to attack.
Cullrak	Cullrak was the site of a victorious battle for the Eldar of Craftworld Mymeara against a Daemon incursion on the planet in 232.M41. Immediately after the battle, the Dark Eldar Kabal of the Fiend Ascendant launched a raid on Cullrak and targeted the Soulstones of the Eldar that fell against the Daemons. Already left weakened by their previous battle and fearing that the Kabal would debase the souls of their dead should they escape back to Commorragh, the Eldar of Mymeara had no choice but to unleash their Ghost Warriors. Once the awakened wraith-constructs attacked the Kabal, they launched one of the most vengeful strikes in Mymeara's history, causing numerous Kabalites and their Raiders to be incinerated by searing plasma blasts.
Morlond	Morlond was a heavily-contested Fortress World that was assaulted by the Imperial Guard during the Sabbat Worlds Crusade. Because the entire Crusade's advance was stalled while Morlond remained in the Chaos forces' hands, Warmaster Macaroth led the invasion in person.[Needs Citation]
Kol'hoosi	Kol'hoosi is a Sept of the Tau Empire. Difficult fighting took place here between T’au forces and hordes of be’gel, during which some Fire Warriors are known to have fled in fear. At least one T’au survivor of the conflict was reassigned to Phaedra as a result.

Though Lyon had the palace's grounds searched, Mason's body was never found.
Esko	Esko is an Imperial world, located in the Reductus Sector of the Segmentum Tempestus.
Sanctimonia Conflict	The Sanctimonia Conflict was a battle fought by the Tome Keepers and other Imperial forces in 291.M37. Fought on the Ecclesiarchy world of Sanctimonia against the forces of Chaos, the entire Sector was set ablaze with heretical corruption. The Tome Keepers responded alongside a Black Templars Crusade, two Convents of Sisters of Battle, and eight Imperial Guard Regiments. However discord among the Imperial forces erupted on the Hive World of Gleb when Canoness Sophira of the Order of the Argent Shroud baulked at the presence of Tome Keepers Librarians. Her distrust of the psykers led to a much higher casualty rate than expected, particularly when telepathic communications from Eshuh were ignored by the Ecclesiarchy forces. Less than a year later, on the shrine world of Bespax, the Tome Keepers under Captain Saduq were forced to destroy a vast crypt containing the bodies of over 300 martyrs when a Warp portal was opened inside by Cultists. This act incensed the Ecclesiarchy. On the Civilised World of Happenstance the Tome Keepers were to join three Dephon Regiments in a combined assault on a Heretic-held city. However the Imperial Guard forces were accompanied by the Cardinal Palatine of Sanctimonia, Simonius Faulke, who ordered them to advance immediately rather than wait for the Space Marines expected Drop Pod assault. The Guardsmen were almost wiped out and the Tome Keepers were forced to abort their own mission. The Tome Keepers decried Faulke while he accused them of dereliction of duty. The final blow came when the Tome Keepers joined in the assault on Sanctimonia alongside the Black Templars and Sisters of Battle. However the Templars and Sisters made no distinction between heretic and civilian and conducted wanton massacres. This horrified the Tome Keepers, who would not forgive their allies for the butchery. This caused the Tome Keepers to depart from the warzone.

Machar	The name or terMacharia was an Imperium militarized Hive World and the sixth planet of the Cadian System. It was destroyed by the forces of Chaos during the Thirteenth Black Crusade and later fell into the System's sun.
Salomine	Salomine is a planet on the edge of the Damocles Gulf, bordering Imperial space. It is unknown when it was first settled, but by the 930's.M41, Salomine was a Tau colony world. In 937.M41, a Chaos warband known as the Ravagers attacked Salomine. Underestimating the Tau defences, and thus being slowed down, an Imperial naval battlefleet had time to catch up with the warband. The warband was nearly wiped out (its remnants being finished off at Adumbria) by the combined firepower. In the end, however, the Tau's defences were weakened and the Imperial battlefleet had suffered little losses. It was then suggested that the planet was attacked by the battlefleet and now might currently belong to the Imperium.
Nachmund Sub-Sector	The Nachmund Gauntlet is a region of space in Segmentum Obscurus focused around the Nachmund Sub-Sector.[2a] Located near the remains of Cadia and the Eye of Terror, the Nachmund Gauntlet was for a time the only stable route through the dreaded Cicatrix Maledictum, making it strategically vital and a source for huge amounts of Imperial refugees.[3a] Later in the Indomitus Crusade, a second passage dubbed the Attilan Gate was also discovered. Currently, the both the northern and some of the southern end of the Nachmund Gauntlet is under siege by the Forces of Chaos though the Imperial succeeded in holding most of the region.[2a] During the Nachmund Rift War almost the entire northern region of the Gauntlet was lost to the Imperium, who now seeks to erect a defensive network known as the Sanctus Wall to block the invasion of the Black Legion under Haarken Worldclaimer. While many worlds north of the Sanctus Wall remain under Imperial control, they are essentially on their own to weather the coming storm.[3b] The situation for the Imperials worsened with the fall of most of Sangua Terra to the Chaos forces.

All contact was lost with the Hive World shortly thereafter. When the Cadian 207th Regiment arrived six months later, there was no trace of any inhabitants, human or otherwise. The Cadian 207th itself was then annihilated by the forces of the Necron Overlord Anrakyr the Traveller, who assumed the Cadians were responsible for the Tomb World's destruction.

Dusk	Gods of the warp strike me down if I ever return to that place. Oh we landed hard and well armed; a score of us—killjacks and pirates every one. We took the cutter down to where the tip-off said the deal was happening… empty, nothing but rotten shacks… nothing! Then that devil fog rolled in and all hell broke loose. I made it out running blind—the screams and the laugher and the awful mocking things all around me! Could have been days, could have been hours, I don’t know… it was the old hag that dragged me out of the fog, and my left eye she took in payment, but at least I was gone from that haunted place! — The Heretic “Captain” Gadred Bayle, Interrogation Testimony Vol. 17[2a] Dusk is an Imperial Feral World,[1b] on the very edge of the Halo Stars.[2a] It is seen as accursed[1a] and is known for the extreme hostility of its native creatures. Amongst certain Rogue Traders and Chartist captains have “A walk on Dusk” become a byword for horrible and painful death.[1c] Dusk is a place of trackless fens, mist-drenched forests, and moss-shrouded wooded swamps. Theoretically a prime candidate for conversion to mass agriculture, but each attempt (going as far back as the days of Angevin’s crusade) has met with disaster, suffering and death, making the world’s very name synonymous with ill-omen, sinister mystery and folly.[2a]
Barbarus	Barbarus was the homeworld of the Death Guard prior to the Horus Heresy. It was the planet on which Mortarion landed; its atmospheric quality was so poor that even Mortarion could not breathe at the top of its mountains. Barbarus was a Feral World which orbited near its dim yellow sun. The atmosphere was thick with virulent gases and a constant fog was spread across the planet. This made it a very dark, dismal place of night with short, shadowy days. Only below the fog could humans survive, in the valleys and low plains. Deadly predators roamed the fog at night, forcing the humans to stay in their villages. At some point, the planet fell under the domination of the Overlords, cruel Xenos species. Able to resist Barbarus' poisons, the Overlords survived within the toxic cloud and built great grey keeps in the mountains. The Overlords began to use the humans as slaves and spread terror among them. After landing on the world, Mortarion eventually led the citizens of Barbarus in a revolt against the mountain ruler, toppling them before joining with the Emperor. On the surface of Barbarus was the Wall of Memory, where the names of every Space Marine of the Death Guard Legion killed during the Great Crusade were carved.

However, the Incontrovertible Truth was ambushed by ships of the Black Legion after dropping out of the Warp in the Erioch System. It is unknown if the mission to Mariach still took place.
Terion	Terion is a Paradise World of the Imperium. In the dawn of the 41st Millennium, Terion was the site of a battle between the Blood Angels, led by Commander Dante, and an unholy alliance of the Night Lords and the Brotherhood of Darkness. The battle's end saw the Blood Angels victorious and, centuries later, Terion has been rebuilt into a paradise. All that remains of that battle's legacy is a monument to Dante, sculpted in marble and standing as a colossus in the capital city, with the statue's outstretched hand reaching to the horizon, offering mercy to forefathers of Terion's citizens.
Agripinaa Sector	This article contains text passages or images with citation issues. The concerned content is marked with "Citation issue" tags. Please help to improve this article by fixing those issues as described in the corresponding Help article. Do also note that it is absolutely forbidden to add new information or content to these marked passages as long as the pre-existing citation issues have not been completely resolved. The Agripinaa Sector is a Sector of Imperial space. It is located in Segmentum Obscurus close to the Eye of Terror. It was a major producer of materials (especially weapons and ammunition) for Cadia and formed a linchpin in the overall defence of the Cadian Gate. In comparison to other sectors it is a wealthy and prosperous area and produces many regiments for the Imperial Guard.[Help] At the start of the Thirteenth Black Crusade, vast numbers of plague hulks were reported. Many were searched and destroyed by Space Marines but ultimately some escaped their attention. Some of these came to spread disease and pestilence throughout the Agripinaa sector. In conjunction with the Belis Corona sector, they were the first to see the rise of the plague zombies created by the spread of the plague, now named the Curse of Unbelief. Cults preaching that the Imperium as a whole had failed and forsaken the teachings of the Emperor grew throughout the sector. Imperial rule on Malin's Reach and Lelithar broke down as the plague had crippled any hopes of restraining the fanatics. Self-mutilation became normal and mobs attacked any naval facilities or general symbol of the Imperium and mob rule replaced that of the Administratum.
Freebooters	Freebooterz are Orks[1a] (and in rare cases - Gretchins) who have separated themselves from their clan (by choice or through being exiled) and go off to live the life of pirates and mercenaries.[1a] The composition of Freebooter bands can vary greatly depending on their origin and history; some are the remnants of shattered warbands, others are eccentrics or fugitives from Ork society.[1a] Freebooterz forsake their previous Clan and tribal allegiances and usually wear a distinctive style of dress to emphasise this, often decorating themselves with ear and nose rings, Jolly Ork symbols and flamboyant clothing. As Freebooterz often don't have access to Painboyz or Mekboyz, their injuries frequently have to be patched up in a temporary manner; thus many Freebooterz sport eyepatches, peg-legs or hook hands. Freebooter bands are often led by a Kaptin, these individuals are even tougher, more ruthless and foul tempered than the rest of their brethren and are usually even more ostentatiously attired, frequently favouring large hats and voluminous coats in which they conceal numerous weapons and flasks of fungus rum.[1a]
Dynax Primus	Dynax Primus is a Forge World of the Imperium. It is known that Macharius Omega tanks are produced on this planet.
Sallan's World Offensive	The Sallan's World Offensive was the Imperial response to an anti-imperial rebellion raised on Sallan's World. At one point secessionist rebels staged an uprising on Sallan's World. Among the Imperial forces that responded to crush the rebellion were the Valhallan 8th Armoured Regiment, who were in their element fighting on the icy world. The regiment made planetfall and took the fight to the rebels in Sallan's World's sub-arctic tundra belt (the only habitable region of the planet). After securing a beachhead, the 8th launched a month-long enveloping offensive, seeking to isolate and cut off the rebel fortress and command centre at Sallan's Point.

Tingoya	Tingoya is a world of the Imperium. It is known for producing Imperial Guard Regiments that are famed for their mobility.
Baran	Baran is an Eldar Exodite World which was later populated by Orks, then the Imperium. Baran is a fecund world of rolling blue oceans, expansive forests, and rolling steppe land. It was originally an Eldar Exodite world, but was conquered by the Orks of Waaagh! Arbuttz late M40. By 224.M41 an Imperial crusade passed over the world with the intention of liberating it from its Ork overlords. The first assaults quickly established the Imperial forces as masters of the steppe-lands. The Feral Ork tribes fled to the hinterlands. General Von Paulus, commanding General of the Krieg 127th Infantry Regiment, lacked the troops to threaten one area without exposing another, so he had a system of fortifications set up to contain the Orks instead. As the only regiment assigned to the crusade, the 127th Infantry Regiment were given the Right of Settlement of Baran. As settlers began to arrive, these fortified positions became the basis for Imperial cities, with a curious blend of civilian structures and military fortifications. As generations passed the original conquering regiment died away and was replaced by home grown PDF forces. and eventually these regiments were inducted into the Imperial Guard as the Baran Siege Masters.
Kanak	Kanak is a volcano-wracked world, peopled by fierce barbarian tribes. Due to the harsh environment, some of its inhabitants have evolved to become closer to Ogryn than human. The Kanaks are recruited into the Imperial Guard as the Kanak Skull Takers regiments where their savage natures can be put to use. In late M41, Kanak fell to an invasion by the Word Bearers Host of the Dark Apostle Oriax.[4b] He was then free to act upon the real reason his Warhost had invaded the world. As unbeknownst to the Imperium, Kanak was a slumbering Necron Tomb World[4f] of the Atun Dynasty[4k], and Oriax sought an entrance to the Xenos' underground domain. Once he found it, the Dark Apostle would use the power from the Necrons' Obelisks to free[4f] the Keeper of Secrets Zarakynel, who was imprisoned within a Tesseract Labyrinth[4h] the Dark Apostle had obtained.[4f] However a plea for aid had already been sent out and as the Dark Apostle began his search, the Space Wolves Strike Cruiser Thunderwolf[4h] emerged from the Warp near Kanak.[4a] The Great Company of the Wolf Lord Ragnar Blackmane had come to aid the beleaguered world[4i], but Oriax's Murder Class Cruiser destroyed the Strike Cruiser in an ambush. The Thunderwolf's wreckage then plummeted towards Kanak but, despite the Strike Cruiser being in several pieces when it landed, a number of Ragnar's Great Company survived the impact.[4a] However, the Wolf Lord landed on a continent far from Oriax's main forces and most of Ragnar's Great Company. He was unable to contact the Space Wolves[4i] and Oriax's Host began hunting the leaderless and scattered Great Company down. The Space Wolves, though, soon began to rally under the leadership of Valgard Twice-Slain, who sought to save Kanak from its invaders.[4c] They would then fight the Word Bearers and their allies of Cultists, Khorne Bloodletters[4d] and Kanak Skull Takers Traitor Guard, the Dark Apostle Oriax had corrupted after conquering the world.[4e]

Bastonbeil	Bastonbeil is a world in Ultima Segmentum far out on the Eastern Fringe, at the very limits of the Astronomican. Once a night-shrouded Hive World, Bastonbeil was a primary recruiting ground for the Death Falcons Space Marine Chapter. However, at the dawn of M41, Bastonbeil fell. Something ancient and terrible rose from the underhive of the capital city, something that fed on the souls of the living and devoured the city's inhabitants by the millions. The Death Falcons responded in their entirety to destroy the creature and its zombie hordes but vanished after three months of fighting within the dark depths of the underhive. What finally emerged instead was the Company of the Shadow, Space Marines with grey armour that writhed with the faces of damned souls. Overthrowing the world's Imperial Commander, for the last 900 years the Company of the Shadow has enslaved Bastonbeil and used it as a base to launch many attacks against neighbouring systems.

Thuleya	Thuleya is an Imperium world that was brought into Compliance by the Space Wolves Legion during the Great Crusade.
Nove Shendak	Nove Shendak is an Imperial world that was brought into compliance during the Great Crusade. It was originally inhabited by a species of Xenos that were described as giant intelligent worms. The worms were described as longer than a Primarch is tall and thick as a man. They had three mouths and a dozen of teeth in each mouth. They communicated with sonic screams and psychic whispers as they burrowed through the mud of the planet. The worms were space travelers and had colonized three other worlds that were purged by the Imperium prior to the battle to bringing Nove Shendak to compliance. The worms used implanted filaments to conduct energies out of their bodies as their primary weapon. The planet was also inhabited by primitive humans, harvested as cattle by the worms. Known to the Great Crusade as World Eight-Two-Seventeen, it was conquered by forces from the World Eaters Legion, then known as the War Hounds, forces from the Iron Warriors, Imperial Army and both the Primarch Perturabo and the Emperor of Mankind himself.
Kenov III	Kenov III is a Death World in the Calixis Sector. By all accounts Kenov III is beautiful, a planet so fertile it would take its place as one of the greatest Agri Worlds in the Sector if only Man could tame it and bring it to heel. There have been at least 12 expeditions to the planet’s surface, all of which have ended in disastrous retreat. In fact, native inhabitants of Kenov III combine aspects of both plant and beast, and have only one purpose: to grow as large and be as prolific as they can before being devoured by another.

Argentor	Argentor is an Imperial Knight World that is located in the Segmentum Obscurus, but has been engulfed by the Great Rift.
Nephilim Sector	The Nephilim Sector is a Sector of the Imperium. It is most notable for being the site of the discovery of the STC to the Nephilim Jetfighter, which was named after the Sector itself. In the wake of the Great Rift's creation, the Imperium noted that it did not recive any distress calls from its worlds in the Sector. Suspicious of what this could mean, Lord Commander Guilliman dispatched the Indomitus Crusade's Battle Group Kallides to investigate. What they found changed the galaxy forever, as they discovered that the Warp had been stilled within a region of the Nephilim Sector. Though they learned that both the engine's of the Battlegroup's warships and its Psykers struggled to operate as a result, the collapse of their Gellar Fields did not cause Daemons to materialize either. A grave draw back, however, was that all the Humans of the Battlegroup - save for its Adepta Sororitas - fell victim to a deep lethargy. Worse still, the Imperial worlds they visited stood empty, devoid of any of its citizens. As a result, that region of the Sector became known to the Crusade fleet as the Pariah Nexus.
Torvendis	Torvendis is a Daemon World located at the very centre of the Maelstrom.[1f] Due to its location it has symbolic value to the Ruinous Powers.[1b] Torvendis's geography is in a constant state of flux and changes significantly every generation. Trying to chart the planet seems to make the changing of the environment even faster.[1e] There are two prominent features on Torvendis, the Canis Mountains, a huge mountain chain where many different peoples live, and the City of Lady Charybdia, where millions live only to worship Slaanesh.[1a] The bedrock of Torvendis itself is made of strata of bodies fallen in battle.[1a]

Hell Forge	Hell Forges are fallen Forge Worlds and the domain of the Dark Mechanicus. Many of these worlds were once loyal Forge Worlds of the Martian Mechanicum, but have since slipped into worship of the Ruinous Powers. Though their origins lay with the original followers of Kelbor-Hal who sided with Horus during the Horus Heresy, many other Mechanicum Forge Worlds have since fallen into corruption. Infernal polluted landscapes, Hell Forges are rife with all kinds of foul Warp Creatures as well as the site of large amounts of Human and Mutant slaves. With many existing within the Eye of Terror or other similar Warp anomalies, these worlds are ruled over by corrupted Magi of the Dark Mechanicum who make pacts with Daemonic entities to develop hellish technologies and churn out weaponry and Daemon Engines for Chaos Space Marines. Hell Forges are also frequent bases of the Traitor Titan Legions.

A mining installation has now been created on Morlex, in order to extract the fuel from the world, and is protected by an armoured column of enclosed vehicles. However, a Chaos Lord has also noticed the riches that Morlex still holds and has sent his own armoured vehicles to destroy the Imperium's forces there and claim the world for himself.

The intention of this mock battle was to test the efficiency of an early version of the Codex Astartes against the unique tactics of the World Eaters Legion. Although the worth of the Codex was proven by Ventantus' success, the battle left swathes of Prandium in ruins and a shadow of its former self. At some undisclosed point after the Battle of Calth, the planet hosted the secret laboratory of the Ultima Taskforce.

The Cult is now attacking Fargon's Imperial Guard outpost, which is the only thing stopping them from seizing control of the world from the Imperium. Though the Guardsmen in the outpost are vastly outnumbered, they are resisting the Genestealer Cult's attacks and have been able to send out a plea for help to the Imperium. It has been answered by a Space Marine strike force and the Guardsmen need to survive, until the Space Marines' warship arrives to aid Fargon.
Salem Proctor	Salem Proctor is a Cardinal World of the Imperium. In 945.M41 the world was ruled by a corrupt and traitorous Cardinal who was eventually declared a heretic by the Inquisition, resulting in a rebellion led by the lowly Preacher Icarael. Eventually two entire Orders of the Sisters of Battle arrived and found that much of the world's population was already in revolt against the Cardinal. The forces of the Ecclesiarchy and Inquisition were victorious, but the fate of Icarael became a major point of tension between Ecclesiarch Decius XXIII and Lord Inquisitor Karamazov. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Stenoth	Stenoth was the site of a battle between the Imperium and a massive Ork horde during the Wars of Admonishment. During the war, the Imperium's advance against the Xenos was stymied by a city-sized Ork fortress known as Gork's Gut. Millions of Orks defended the fortress, which at its highest points broke the upper atmosphere of Stenoth, and it contained heavy ordnance, as well as being wreathed in Kustom Force Fields. These defenses resulted in the Imperium's first two massive attacks against Gork's Gut ending in failure and a large loss of life. Before a third attempt was made, several Blood Angels Primaris Kill-Teams were sent to infiltrate the Ork fortress and disable its defenses. Though they faced heavy resistance from the Orks, the Kill Teams were successful in knocking out the fortress' shield generators, demolishing its main gate from within, and assassinating – at steep cost in lives – the Orks’ Warlord. When the third Imperial attack was then launched, it surged to victory thanks to the Blood Angels' efforts.
Balzac	Balzac is an Imperial world, located in the Chinchare sub-sector of the Segmentum Obscurus. During the 13th Black Crusade, Balzac's defenders were on the verge of being overwhelmed by Chaos forces, before being rescued at a crucial moment by the sudden appearance of Eldar reinforcements, who had arrived throughout the Chinchare sub-sector simultaneously to rout the invaders.
Styrus (Hive World)	Styrus was among a dozen worlds on Ultramar's eastern edge to be attacked by the Traitor forces of Princep Maxiums Horgoth Nyr during the Horus Heresy.

It was once the site of the Red Tithe of the Carcharodon Astra Adeptus Astartes Chapter. [1a]
Blackstone Fortress	Blackstone Fortresses (known as Talismans of Vaul by the Eldar) are massive starships created in the distant past to protect against the return of the C'tan.[Conflicting Sources] Their exact origins are unclear, though it is suggested they were built by the Old Ones. Six were found by the Imperium in the Gothic Sector around M31, and were used as naval bases,[1b] until Mephet'ran the Deceiver discovered their location, and manipulated Abaddon into capturing two, and destroying the other four, during the Gothic War. One of these was given to Huron Blackheart, and the other was used to destroy Cadia during the 13th Black Crusade.[8b] Several more Blackstone Fortresses exist across the Galaxy, including one recently discovered in the Western Reaches.[8c] It is believed that the Blackstone Fortresses were created by the Old Ones to combat the C'tan. Though other sources state that they were created by the Eldar before their Fall, in order to destroy the C'tan should they ever return.[Conflicting Sources] Eldar Mythology holds that they were created by Vaul, the Eldar smith god, to end the War in Heaven and that they contain the souls of Eldar Seers who perished in the war. The Talismans are said to contain Eyes of the Witch, created by the Crone Goddess Morai-Heg, which would allow the slain heroes to channel unfathomable amounts of energy out of the Immaterium to forever banish the Yngir. It is said that during the Necron Revolt, the Blackstone Fortresses were used to shatter the C'tan known as The Void Dragon.

Vorakis	Vorakis was once an Imperium Nihilus Hive World, until the Word Bearers successfully invaded it in M42. Its population was massacred during the invasion and afterwards, the Traitor Legion forced the survivors to convert to the worship of the Chaos. Afterwards, the Word Bearers used them as slave labor to erect an immense shrine-fortress dedicated to the Chaos Gods. Once it was done, the Traitor Legion ritually sacrificed Vorakis' surviving population, in order to consecrate the shrine-fortress' completion. It is not clear if Vorakis lies in Segmentum Obscurus or Ultima Segmentum.
Auric	Auric is an Imperium planet.[1a] The planet Auric is the first planet in the Amarah system.[1a] During the early stage of the Battle of Amarah, due to massive flux sprang into being near the Amarah star, the plasma and radiation were violently ejected into space in a series of massive solar flares. The fury of the injured star was so tremendous that it reached the planet Auric and flash-incinerated everything on its day-side in an instant.[1b]
Sol	The Sol System or Terran System is the name of the Solar System in the Age of the Imperium. The system is named for its sun, and is part of the Segmentum Solar. Its planets include Holy Terra and Mars. The birthplace of humanity on the planet Terra, the Sol System was fully colonized by humans by M15. During the Dark Age of Technology humanity expanded across the stars thanks to the invention of Warp Drives and Navigators, and in this period the Sol System was dominated by the empires of Terra and Mars which coexisted peacefully. During the Age of Strife, the Sol System fell into complete anarchy. Terra collapsed into wars between Techno-Barbarians while Mars reverted to complete isolation and religious worship of technology. Salvation only came with the coming of the Emperor, who unified Terra, Mars, and then the entire Sol System into the fledgling Imperium during the Unification Wars and Great Crusade. During the subsequent Horus Heresy, the Sol System was the site of bitter fighting between loyalists and traitors during the Schism of Mars and Solar War. At the final phase of the war Horus' forces succeeded in capturing the Sol System and besieged Terra itself, but were eventually defeated and repelled during the Great Scouring. Since that time, the Sol System has not been the site of all-out war though it did see fighting during the War of the Beast, Age of Apostasy, and recently the Battle of Lion's Gate. The System was also saw a minor but mysterious Necron raid on Mars in late M41.
Tephaine	Tephaine is a Hive World in the Calixis Sector, part of the Tephaine System.
Plarsdek	Plarsdek is an Imperial Industrial World, that was invaded by Orks in M42. However the Adeptus Custodes' Allarus Custodians came to the world's aid and destroyed the Xenos.
Reth	Historically, Reth has been entirely dependent upon its reputation as a paradise world. Consisting largely of a vast archipelago of thousands of golden islands scattered across a shallow warm turquoise sea, its climate and environment are said to be perfect for soothing and rejuvenating the tired and troubled mind. For over a thousand years, the planet's hereditary monarchs traded off this reputation, until the de Caul family staged a successful coup two centuries ago. The de Cauls, a mid-ranking clan of Imperial nobles, brought a new and more severe interpretation of the Imperial cult to the laid back and pleasure loving planet. Now, whilst it retains (to some extent) its status as a favoured destination for senior Adeptus Terra functionaries and Imperial Nobles, it also boasts a small, yet influential, complex for the treatment of mental disorders operated by the Orders Hospitaller of the Adepta Sororitas. This facility, the Asylum of Saint Vero, based on Reth's third largest island, treats over a million inmates, all suffering from a variety of mental illnesses. It is a conglomeration of hospitals, clinics and shrines maintained by the dutiful and dedicated sisters.
Ork Empire of Charadon	The Ork Empire of Charadon is a major Ork Empire centered around the Charadon System in Ultima Segmentum. Its ruling Warboss is known as the Arch-Arsonist of Charadon. The Ork Empire of Charadon is the largest and most long lasting Ork Empire in existence and has been a bane of Ultima Segmentum for countless centuries. Until recently, the expansion of the Charadon empire has been limited by the Ultramarines and forces led by Librarian Tigurius have made surgical strikes upon the Arch-Arsonist's forces, preventing them from being able to organize a full scale Waaagh! into Ultramar itself. However Tigurius's efforts are beginning to wane in the wake of Tyranid enroachment into Ultima Segmentum as the Ultramarines can no longer spare troops to hold the nearby Ork empire in check. The Ork Empire of Charadon has seized its chance and recently invaded the Ultramar system. The Ork Empire of Charadon under Arch-Arsonist Snagrod infamously invaded Rynn's World, homeworld of the Crimson Fists Space Marine Chapter, in 988.M41. The ensuing battle saw the near total destruction of the Crimson Fists and the destruction of their fortress-monastery.
Volturn	Volturn was a world encountered by the Imperium during the Great Crusade. Thought to be Compliant, in 954.M30 the Ultramarines revisited the world after their Librarians reported inhuman screaming emanating from its location. Upon setting foot on Volturn, the Ultramarines suffered spontaneous and fatal cerebral aneurysms and were forced to evacuate.
Horestis	Horestis is a former Daemon World of Nurgle. Horestis was a Daemon World given wholly over to the power of Nurgle, when Chaplain Vorxec Calvarius of the Silver Skulls led a demi-company of his brothers to its surface. There the Space Marines brought fire to the world and cleansed a great many of Horestis' corrupted sites. But with each victory more Silver Skulls fell, until only Vorxec remained. When the Chaplain found himself surrounded by a horde of Nurgle's servants, he called for an Exterminatus, from the Imperial Navy in orbit. However, instead of receiving purifying flames, the Navy sent a Virus Bomb. Prognosticator Vorxec Calvarius turned traitor after surviving the Virus Bomb and enduring 49 days of agony, and he converted to the Plague God and now leads a force of traitors that plunders the stars.
Belphago	Belphago is a Dead World. A mysterious planet, it is home to ancient xenos ruins pre-dating human civilisation. Maze-like in structure, they may have been erected as a form of worship to Dark Gods predating humanity. In 307.M40, Belphago was the base of the Daemon Prince known as the Horned God and was the site of the final battle of the Aschen War.
Eurytion	Eurytion is a planet in the Palatine Sector. The Sister Repentia who would become Saint Celestine lived and met her first death here, fighting against the heretics of the Palatine Schism.
Kodiak Prime	Kodiak Prime is a world fought on by Saint Celestine. During the War of Faith, Saint Celestine and the Adepta Sororitas defeated an Eldar conclave on the planet. Their victory is celebrated during the Blessing of the Wound festival on the planet Neva. The citizens honor Saint Celestine by having a reenactment of the battle, using live ammo.
Scintilla Prime	Scintilla Prime is an Imperium world that was devastated in an attack by the Daemons of Slaanesh. It is also noted for having the first appearance of a Slaanesh Hellflayer in battle.
Gonomondium	Gonomondium is a Quarantined World of the Imperium. It is described as a plague-ridden planet unsuitable for habitation.
Sha'draig	Sha'draig was a Tau colony world, that was invaded by Hive Fleet Gorgon in 900.M41. Gorgon was eventually driven from the world, but not before it was almost completely consumed by Ripper swarms. Gorgon, unique for its ability to rapidly evolve its bioforms, first attacked an orbital perimeter outpost of Sha'draig in 980899.M41, then continued on to the shipyards of Sha'draig's moon. Initially the defenders sealed themselves in the main complex and trusted in the shipyard's interceptor guns to hold the invaders back, but soon an adapted strain of Gargoyle with a refractive mucous coating that lessened the damage from interceptor fire overwhelmed the shipyards and slaughtered its remaining defenders. The Kel'shan Sept fleet was sent to investigate the outpost's silence. But by the time it arrived in 420990.M41, Sha'draig was already under siege by the Tyranids. Valroth's fleet broke through the Tyranid blockade surrounding the planet long enough to deliver reinforcements to the surface. On Sha'draig, Hormagaunts assaulted the Tau outer defence lines in the nearby forests, which Shas'el Vorcah had filled with Kroot auxiliaries directed by Shaper Pechallai. However many of the Tyranid creatures ended up entangled in the forest's undergrowth where the Kroot could easily dispatch of them. Gorgon's next wave was of new Hormagaunts adapted to be swifter and less prone to being entangled, but they were also eventually stopped by the brute force and tenacity of the Kroot. A final wave, consisting of Hormagaunts honed to pierce and tear Kroothide, ultimately swamped Pechallai's defences. The Hormagaunt's adaptions however had weakened their own resistance to injury and so when they emerged from the forests, the Tau defenders quickly gunned them down.
Orar (planet)	Orar is a Hive World in the Gothic Sector. The planet shares a name with the Space Marine chapter the Sons of Orar and their spiritual patriarch Orar, though the history of the chapter's founding is lost to Imperial records. It was the site of an early victory by the Imperium against the Chaos fleets, reversing a string of victorious first strike raids, during the Gothic War. An Imperial battlegroup, led by Captain Compel Bast aboard the Imperious, stationed at Orar, defended against a Chaos warfleet led by Warmaster Malefica Arkham on the Deathbane. The Chaos fleet was pursued out of the system and only a handful of Chaos escorts escaped without damage. Later in the war, Captain Leoten Semper of the Lord Solar Macharius was assigned to protect convoys travelling from Bhein Morr to Orar, a dangerous route often attacked by pirate "Wolf Packs".
Beta-Entebes III	Beta-Entebes III is a high gravity Imperium world that is populated by Ogryns.
Ceocan	Ceocan is an Imperial Agri World located on the galactic south-east edges of Segmentum Tempestus. It is a inter-sector system that lies in Sector Ephialtis, a sector that has the Adeptus Mechanicus as the primary agent. The system holds a gas giant, 3 asteroid belts and a halo cloud that contains rich amounts of radioactive materials. The planet Ceocan itself features a wide variety of biomes, each sparsely settled, with population centres invariably tightly arranged around the production of foodstuffs. Huge grain fields and orchards cover the temperate areas. Seaweed and fish are harvested via bulk trawlers and massive underground caverns produce fungi whose blooms can grow so large and heavy that they may crush a harvester that's not careful enough. All of the machinery used to harvest the foodstuffs is fuelled by biofuels produced by the giant grain fields. Although the Imperial Tithe is described as "high", the planetary production is far in excess of the consumption. Even the poorest of peasants has more than enough food for his daily needs and tends to eat healthier and more lavish food than even very wealthy hive worlders can afford. The foodstuffs that Ceocan produces are of such high standards that they could satisfy even the pickiest of Paradise Worlds. The foodstuffs are however not shipped off for enjoyment on other worlds but are instead exported to the Adeptus Mechanicus and processed in an orbital facility named Callistonian Haven where the food is mixed and rendered down into tasteless beige paste, which is then dried and cut into bricks. These nutrient bricks are then shipped to feed the servants of the Mechanicus. The Adeptus Mechanicus have run projections and deduced that this arrangement is 2.7% more efficient than bringing in the ration bars by ship from other systems.
Ritzos	Ritzos is known for raising the Ritzos Imperial Guard Regiments.
Pluto	Pluto is a dwarf planet of the Sol System. It maintains relay stations used to detect ships attempting to reach Terra, capital of humanity. During the Dark Age of Technology, Pluto along with Uranus were the site of Warp gates that allowed for easy travel to and from the Sol System. During the Horus Heresy, the world and its accompanying moons was the site of a major Alpha Legion attack in what became the first major engagement of the Solar War. Later in the final phase of the Solar War, Pluto was again a battleground as Sigismund of the Imperial Fists attempted to defend it against a massive Sons of Horus attack led by Horus Aximand. During the fighting, Pluto's moons were captured and had their guns turn on the loyalist forces while the moon of Kerberos was completely destroyed as part of a trap by Sigismund. Pluto was subsequently reclaimed by the Imperium during the Great Scouring.
Key (Device)	The Key is the name of an artifact of an artifact of Old Ones technology which allows for the accessing of The Lock and with it a device of unimaginable power known as The Weapon.[3a] The Key is composed of a great number of esoteric artefacts that were scattered across time and space during a long-ago catastrophe[1b]. The powerful Daemon Vashtorr became aware of the Key and believed that if it was restored and accessed The Lock and The Weapon he could use its power to become the fifth Chaos God[1a]. He did not know precisely what form all of these Key fragments took, but after many mortal lifespans Vashtorr learned that each had their own unique Warp signature. This would allow them to be tracked down and once all were found, the Daemon would use an infernal ritual, warp alchemy and inhuman ingenuity to restore the Key. Vashtorr would need aid to do this, however, and this led him to seek out Abaddon the Despoiler, who commanded the vast forces of the Black Legion[1b]. Though Abaddon was wary of Vashtorr at first, he agreed to enter an alliance with the Daemon to restore the Key, after Vashtorr informed him the weapon's power could be used to finally destroy the Imperium[1a]. Afterwards, Vashtorr began creating the Arks of Omen Space Hulks, with the aid of Abaddon's Dark Mechanicum allies, and gave them to the Despoiler to command. They were designed to both track down the Key-fragments and destroy any force that tried to prevent that from happening. While Abaddon would give some to high ranking Black Legion officers, he also gave some to powerful Chaos commanders that swore to aid him in his quest.[1b] The nature of The Key remained highly mysterious; all Abaddon let his lieutenants know is that it makes the servants of the Emperor greater traitors than any Chaos Space Marine. The fragments of the Key vary greatly in size and shape, from ancient pillars to meteorite-like constructs to cogitator banks.[1b]
Brigannion Four	Brigannion Four is a Fortress World lying just outside the Eye of Terror, nicknamed the Planet of Steel. It is not a Daemon World, but its surface still writhes with the Daemonic energies of the Warp. Brigannion Four was first conquered by the Night Lords during the Age of Apostasy. They performed a year-long ritual, sacrificing a great deal of the planet's population to the Gods of Chaos in exchange for unimaginably powerful spells of daemonic protection. Since then, several Traitor Legions have fought for control of Brigannion Four. It is claimed not only by the Night Lords, but also by the Black Legion, the Death Guard, the Sons of Hate, and the Brotherhood of Blood. Currently, it is held by the Iron Warriors, ruled by Manneus Drath. They further enhanced the defensive capabilities, turning Brigannion Four into an outright vast fortress of corrupt magic and machines. So far, they have successfully repelled seventeen invasions by Imperial and Chaos forces alike, earning Brigannion Four the nickname Planet of Steel.
Samech	Samech is a Hell Forge of the Dark Mechanicum, known as the "Fallen Forge World". When the Warp Storm known as the Hadex Anomaly erupted in the Jericho Reach region in early M40, the Forge World initially remained a bastion of faith to the Cult Mechanicus and the Imperium. However, as time wore on and the world came under frequent xenos and raider attack, the Quorum of Magi leading the Forge World began to question the Imperium, suspecting they had been abandoned. The Magi determined that Samech would only survive through self-sufficiency. In their quest for self-sufficiency, the Techpriests of Samech began to dabble in Techno-Heresy and explore any new weapon or machine that would benefit their Forge World. The defenses of the planet were reinforced with these new forbidden technologies. As xenos and raider attacks intensified, paranoia grew as the Priests of Samech viewed any outsider as enemies. Finally, in 325.M40, an Explorator Fleet arrived in orbit, unaware of what had transpired on the planet. Samech's defenses fired on and destroyed the Mechanicus fleet, and Samech was declared to be an apostate world by the High Lords of Terra. The Quorum of Samech by this point viewed their world as an independent realm, free from the dogma of the Imperium. Soon Samech forces began raiding nearby planets for resources and slaves to work their Forges.
Mekslag-Ikks	Mekslag-Ikks is an Ork World in Segmentum Tempestus formerly belonging to the Imperium.[1c] Originally known as Kastorel-Novem, it was first colonized in M38.[1a] In 064952.M41 the world was assaulted by the Ork Mek-Boss Buzzgob during Waaagh! Garaghak. Despite a strong resistance from the planet's garrison, including the 49th Terrax Guard, it was evacuated and fell in 723952.M41. Buzzgob turned the captured Kastorel-Novem (renamed Mekslag-Ikks by Orks) into his personal manufacturing base.[1c]
Foronika	Foronika is a world that lies within the Argovon System. It is the innermost of the system's worlds.[2a] It is the most sparsely populated world of the Argovon System, but of immense strategic significance due to its noctilith deposits. The Adeptus Mechanicus have taken great interest in Foronika.[2a] Foronika once possessed a relatively primitive populace of nomadic tribesmen. However, at one point the Rogue Trader Volorin Kendar arrived on the planet, being forced to hunker down on Foronika in order to hide from those he owed considerable debts to. Kendar spent twelve years on Foronika, during which he wrote a painstaking account of his life on the world.[2a]
Blackwater	Blackwater is an Imperial Feral World. Most notably the planet is where the Crimson Fists Chapter draws its aspirants from. The Chapter annually travels to the planet to conduct the Festival of the Bloodied Fist. Through the course of this ceremony, candidates are subjected to a battery of trials that are used to evaluate their martial, mental, and spiritual prowess. The few who make through the trials are then required to travel deep into Blackwater’s toxic swamps and kill a barb dragon with their bare hands. Each year, there are few who manage to complete this brutally challenging test.
Zephyr	Zephyr is the homeworld of the Storm Hawks Space Marine Chapter.
Gythos	Gythos was a world of the Imperium. In 888.M41 the planet was subjected to a Daemonic incursion. However a Necron fleet soon appeared and battled the Daemons, seemingly saving the world. Nonetheless the citizens of Gythos had little time to celebrate as the Necrons began harvesting the planet.
Solstice	Solstice is a primitive and "half-frozen" world reaching a feudal stage. It is religiously significant for being the world in which the missionary Uriah Jacobus uncovered and purged a Genestealer infestation. The now-famous Jacobus came to the world in order to bring the worship of the Emperor, first spending three years gaining knowledge of the inhabitants of Solstice, before beginning to introduce the precepts of Imperial worship into Solstice's own disorganized religion. On meeting with the ruler of one the world's kingdoms, Jacobus spied a horrific four-armed statue of the realm's god of death. Recognizing the four-armed statue as the unmistakable mark of Genestealer infiltration, Jacobus persuaded the more friendly rulers of the planet to align with each other and attack the alien-subverted kingdom. As soon as Jacobus arrived at the head of the loyal army the terrible truth became apparent as his army was attacked by a swarm of Genestealers. Managing to smash through a screen of human brood brothers, his knights reached the heart of the cult, slaying both the Patriarch and Magus. Thrown into disorientation and confusion at the sudden loss of their leaders, the rest of the cult were massacred in a final charge. The battle made Jacobus a legendary figure.
Brendine II	Brendine II was destroyed by the forces of the Slaanesh worshiper Kallow the Tame, because it failed to amuse him.
Tsan Domus	Tsan Domus is an Imperial world. Tsan Domus was the site of Ultima Segmentum’s worst witch-cult uprising in four hundred years. Among the horrors committed was the murder of an entire Order Militant Minoris. Tsan Domus eventually became a war grave, as the Imperium fought the cult to retake the planet.
Cruelty of Geoffros	The Cruelty of Geoffros is a Stormbolter that is owned by the Blood Ravens Chapter. It was originally wielded by the Crimson Fists Space Marine Geoffros, when the Invasion of Rynn's World occurred. However Geoffros was elsewhere serving under an Inquisitor at that time and he asked to be allowed to go to the aid of his Homeowrld. The Inquisitor refused his request, though, and instead sent Geoffros to the Hive World Turren Primus, to hunt down a Heretic within Hive Qualitas undercity. This caused Geoffros to become gripped with madness and he used his Stormbolter to slaughter every underdweller he found in Hive Qualitas. It is not known what became of the heretical Geoffros afterwards, but his Stormbolter, now named the Cruelty of Geoffros, was later found by the Blood Ravens, during the Second Aurelia Campaign.
Atraxian III	Atraxian III is an Imperium world located in the Calixis Sector.
Korlin II	Korlin II is a world where Khorne is worshiped, but he is known there as Khargg the Red Hound.

Vendorak	Vendorak is a world that was invaded by Hive Fleet Leviathan. In 939.M41 when Vendorak was invaded by a tendril of Hive Fleet Leviathan, the planet's moon was destroyed by ships of the Ultramarines, Howling Griffons and Aurora Chapter. The moon's explosion sent a shock wave through an asteroid belt near Vendorak and debris from the asteroids crashed down on the planet and killed the Tyranids upon it. The Hive Fleet was completely destroyed as a result and the nearby worlds of the Jomm Star System were saved from the ravages of Leviathan.
Vuthulea II	Sometime after the Great Rift's creation the great and marvelous cathedral complex of Vuthulea II was destroyed during a campaign in which the Raven Guard participated.
Hubris	Hubris is a planet located in the Helican Subsector, named for what was later judged as the foolhardiness of the colonists who founded a society there despite the planet's harsh climate.[1c] Founded at an unknown point in history, the original settlers had travelled to the world making use of cryogenic methods and techniques to get through the seventy year voyage. However, upon arriving in system they found to their dismay that they had been misled regarding the situation the planet was in - rather than a regular orbit and the standard season range this brought they were instead faced with a planet which spent a large amount of its existence swathed in ice. The planet was locked into an elliptical orbit around its sun which saw it icebound for eleven of the twenty-nine months in its solar cycle. Despite this the settlers decided to make the planet their home.[1a][1c] In order to survive, the settlers stripped out the vast cryogenic chambers they had used during the long journey and installed them on the planet's surface.[1b] During the planet's eleven-month winter (aptly named "Dormant"), 99% of the population lay dormant in their individual chambers, while the remaining 1% remained awake to tend the machinery and prepare for the reawakening, known as "Thaw", followed by the planet's active period known as "Vital."[1a]
Zambeque	Zambeque is a strategically important Imperial planet sometimes known as the gateway to the Gothic Sector. In 883.M37, it was the site of the Zambeque Rebellion after its Governor was revealed to be Solas, a Fallen Angel who had allied with the Alpha Legion.
Battlefleet Gothic Rulebook	The Battlefleet Gothic Rulebook was released in 1999 for the Battlefleet Gothic game, by Games Workshop. It contains the rules for playing the game over 160 pages with 16 pages and the covers in colour, with the rest in black and white. The majority of the book's contents are available for download on Games-Workshop's official website. The book contains the rules needed to play space battles in the 41st Millennium.
Talasa Prime	Talasa Prime is an Imperial Fortress World, that has been gifted in perpetuity to the Deathwatch by the Ultramarines Chapter. It is home to a large Inquisitorial Fortress of the Ordo Xenos, and is most notable for housing the headquarters of the Deathwatch Chapter of the Space Marines, known as the alien hunters. Talasa Prime now serves as its main training site, where the Deathwatch recruits, equips, and trains Space Marines in the art of hunting Xenos. The Fortress also recruits, trains and equips Kill-Teams composed from the Ultramarines, Scythes of the Emperor and Lamenters Chapters for service against the Tyranids. Since the creation of the Great Rift, however, the influx of Space Marines from the Imperium Nihilus has all but stopped. Rumors suggest the Watch Fortresses of Praefex Venatoris and Fort Excalibris now share the responsibility for training those Deathwatch members that are active in that blighted realm.
Guranta	Guranta is an Imperial world.
Chaemos	Chaemos is a planet in Segmentum Tempestus[Note 1] notable as the scene of the Chaemos Rebellion in late M38. It is known to raise regiments called the Chaemosian Royal Guard.
Cystan	Cystan was the site of a battle between the Iron Knights Chapter and the Dark Eldar.
Monrass	Monrass is a Feral World in the Calixis Sector. It is a lush and verdant backwater world featuring diverse landscapes, from snowy peninsulas to arid deserts unspoiled by industry or exploitation. Monrass is populated by burgeoning archaic empires that predate the Angevin Crusade and have only in recent centuries mastered iron-smelting and chariot combat. The planet’s “governor” is an Administratum satrap, sitting in an high orbital tithing station, who interferes only to occasionally levy troops and foodstuffs for the Imperium’s due, while the only other off-worlders known to the people are a handful of missionaries determined to bring the Emperor’s light to the benighted natives.[3a] Imperial Regiments are tithed from this world.[3c] The Scar Dragons are in danger of vanishing as their scales are valued for the construction of a particularly durable form of armour.[3b]
Bast's World	Bast's World is an Imperial world.
Ghül	Ghül is the chief of the seven worlds raised in honour of the fallen daemon-king Yssarile by a Pre-Dawn daemon civilization that was dead long before the Eldar came to the stars. Fleeing the Warp, this civilization of daemons (the losing side in some form of war) interred their dead king on a suitable world: Ghül. The main population centre was constructed on top of Yssarile's mausoleum and his "barque" or ship (the literal translation of the word is closer to "chariot" or "galley"). Six other worlds were similarly taken over and dedicated to Yssarile. Eventually, the daemon civilisation collapsed and almost all historical trace of them was lost. Ghül is located in an uncharted star system codified 5213X by the Imperium, 3 months outside of Imperial space. The Imperial Carto-Imperialis code also applies to the world, meaning that Ghül too can be referred to as 5213X. The world has the strange property of being nearly invisible to visual scanning, giving the impression that it lacks distinct substance. The effect is said to be unnerving to the viewer; Ghül was described by Inquisitor Eisenhorn as "a shadow against the starfield, a faintly discernible echo of matter."
Zel Tertius	Zel Tertius is a Frontier World in the Calixis Sector. It is seen as a model colony. This article purports to rely on sources which are not cited in the body of the text.For help on citation see the citation guidelines. You can help Lexicanum by fixing it.
Vastum-01	Forge World Vastum-01 is a former Forge World that circles a red star. It used to be a mighty manufactoria planet surrounded by mineral-rich moons which were heavily mined. Once the system was stripped of resources during the time of Iron Duke Glevan, the moons were detonated at their cores to gain access to the last of the valuable ores. The Forge World was then abandoned by the Mechanicus. The planet has large bodies of water, which has turned corrosive from a long age of exposure to pollution.
Heugen's Anvil	Heugen's Anvil is an Imperium world that was invaded by a large splinter of Hive Fleet Kraken during the Second Tyrannic War. However, the Imperial Fists Chapter had been forewarned of the splinter fleet's approach and had fortified the world into a killing field. When the Tyranids invaded, they were obliterated and the splinter fleet's Bio-ships were destroyed by the Chapter's Battle Barges. As the last Bio-ship was destroyed, though, the Imperial Fists received distress calls from the neighbouring Poltiskyne System, which was now being invaded by Tyranids as well. The Imperial Fists soon realized that the splinter fleet they had just destroyed, was simply one half of a larger Fleet and its surviving half was at that very moment descending upon several of Poltiskyne's undefended worlds.
Enkidu	Enkidu is a world of the Askellon Sector. Enkidu is a world of impossibly dense and dark forests and is home to a variety of fearsome beasts which terrorize the local primitive population. The locals are a hardy stock whose small, isolated villages constantly war with one another, with only the strongest surviving. However, instead of taking control of territory in their never-ending conflicts, the victors instead take slaves. Thus each of the tribes is divided into the tribal rulers who have taken a prisoner and those who are enslaved. Who is free and slave is ever-shifting and the locals accept their change in status with unusual quiescence. Though in a strategically important location, travel to the surface of Enkidu is forbidden by Imperial authorities and the planet is shrouded in mystery. A permanent blockade fleet is in orbit to prevent any from violating the orders. When Enkidu was first discovered by Humanity and incorporated into the Imperium isn't truly known, but it has been observed that the Warp itself seems to recoil in terror around its presence.
Soprony	Soprony is a Forbidden/Xenos World in the Calixis Sector.
Labyrinth World	Labyrinth Worlds are planets that, while once heavily urbanized and industrialized, have since been largely abandoned for whatever reason. Their cities have since become labyrinth-like mazes of ruins and abandoned streets. Labyrinth worlds are often still rich with resources that can still be reclaimed.
Dynostix V	Dynostix V is an Imperium Forge World that was looted by the Ork hordes of the Warlord Ghazghkull Thraka.
Imperium Nihilus	Imperium Nihilus, also known as the Dark Imperium, is a newly formed region of Imperial territory encompassing much of Segmentum Obscurus and Ultima Segmentum. The Dark Imperium is a region of space that became isolated from the greater Imperium, now known as the Imperium Sanctus, due to the formation of the Great Rift at the end of the Thirteenth Black Crusade. The "Dark Imperium" is aptly named, for here the light of the Astronomican is obscured, travel is extremely dangerous, astropathic communication is difficult, and many enemies of Humanity besiege its remaining isolated worlds. Though Imperium Sanctus suffers from a myriad of problems and threats, they pale in comparison to those of Imperium Nihilus.[7b] Chaos fleets and warbands in particular reave with near-impunity, new Daemon Worlds allow for Daemonic armies to roam freely, and many of the isolated Imperial worlds in this blighted region believe themselves the last outpost of mankind. Many of these worlds have essentially seceded from Imperial rule, establishing themselves as petty kingdoms. It is not uncommon for these small palatinates to fall under the sway of Chaos armies. It is doubtful that even Abaddon himself is aware of every such sovereign empire spreading beyond the influence of the Imperium, though rumors are abound that he is guiding them. Travel across the Great Rift to the Dark Imperium is said to be difficult to nigh-impossible. A stable route, known as the Nachmund Gauntlet was eventually discovered and is now one of the most strategically vital regions of the Galaxy. Until the Indomitus Crusade, it was not even clear to the Imperium if anything remained alive on the other side of the Rift. Lord Commander Roboute Guilliman has declared one of the aims of the Indomitus Crusade to be the liberation of the stranded worlds within Imperium Nihilus.
Eireius	Eireius was an Imperium Agri World that was destroyed by Hive Fleet Leviathan. In 998.M41, doom came to Eireius when a tendril of Hive Fleet Leviathan fell upon it, and Tyranids were soon rampaging across its floating jungles and vapour islands. A detachment of Imperial Knights from House Raven were the first Imperial reinforcements to reach the Agri World, and they rallied its beleaguered defenders as they battled the Tyranids. However, not even the might of House Ravens' Knights could save the world from the ravages of Hive Fleet Leviathan, and Eireius soon fell, though the Knights' bravery bought time for its surviving population to escape into the void.
Toreus	Toreus was an Imperial planet cleansed of Daemons by virus bomb exterminatus in 879.M41. In 579.M41 Toreus was cut off by a warp storm. Three hundred years passed until it emerged. In 879.M41 it was utterly changed into a Daemon World of horrors. The warp rift, a tear in reality and the Daemons' gateway to the physical realm, appeared in the skies as a pulsing ring of purple fire, heralded a week beforehand by strange portents and omens such as statues dripping blood, birds flying backwards, even Imperial Commander Ghorstwenckler's daughter trying to bite out his throat, and many other such horrors. Portals opened everywhere across the planet's surface and hosts of Daemons poured forth into reality. The planet fell. The soldiers of Toreus fought vainly. Ghorstwenckler fell to his knees at the feet of the Tzeentch Daemon Prince K'tzis'trix'a'tzar and begged for his life. The Daemon Prince responded with a spell of change of unprecedented power. Ghorstwenckler's palace was razed by mystical flames and from the ashes rose crystal and jagged mirrors that reflected the realm of chaos. Two twin columns of fire rose into the sky - echoes of the Towers of Helixis that flank the doorway of Tzeentch's Hidden Library. All of Toreus was bent and twisted to the insane whims of its daemonic conquerors. Epidemius rounded up and incarcerated millions of refugees within walls of suppurating flesh and catalogued every disease and mark upon them before feeding them to Beasts of Nurgle.
Kroxis	Kroxis is a world of the galaxy. It is known that regiments of the Roane Deepers fought on Kroxis at some point prior to the Sabbat Worlds Crusade.
Diosis System	The Diosis System is a star system of Imperial space.
Assault on Beroghast	The Assault on Beroghast was a battle in 963.M41 between Ork forces under Warboss Snappaklaw and the Imperium. Snappaklaw led his large Waaagh! on the Ice World of Beroghast, swiftly overwhelming its defenders. The Grey Knights Second Brotherhood under Brother-Captain Arno Trevan arrived to defend the planet, masterminding a series of decisive strikes to cut off the greenskin supply lines. The final blow was delivered on the banks of the River Gandor, where Trevan and his closest warriors ambushed and slew Snappaklaw himself. Three days later, Space Marines of the Fire Lords Chapter under the command of Chapter Master Jaric Phoros arrived to discover the Orks in full retreat, with the local primitive tribes speaking of their "steel saviours."
Azbaragus	Azbaragus is a Chaos world whose population worships Nurgle. Azbaragus was once a backwater world that was in the grips of a wasting disease that was killing its population, when the Death Guard Sorcerer Porphyricus found it. When he walked amongst its people, he appeared like a beacon of hope, as his own blighted body was still strong, while theirs were left weak from the disease ravaging their world. As the people looked upon him, Porphyricus claimed that the worship of his God would cure their aliments and the people of Azbaragus readily bowed to his wisdom and prayed to Nurgle, a fact that greatly pleased the Chaos God. Porphyricus was true to his word, and the world's now corrupted population no longer suffer pain from the disease and have gained strength from their worship of their new God. Now known as The Blighted, they serve as faithful retainers and servants to Porphyricus and his Death Guard contingent.
Yundo	Yundo was the site of a battle for the Ultramarines, following the Chapter's devastation in the First Tyrannic War.
Masali	Masali is an arid Desert World converted to an Agri World, and part of the stellar realm of Ultramar in the Ultima Segmentum. Like its sister planets Quintarn and Tarentus (known collectively as the "Three Planets" of Ultramar), it is covered in vast domed horticultural cities and water traps to capture the water needed to grow vast quantities of food.[Needs Citation] The food produced by these planets is exported around the galaxy, and also used to support the Ultramarines in their campaigns.[Needs Citation] The Three Planets were each invaded by Ork scavengers just after the Battle of Macragge and Marneus Calgar led the Ultramarines to reconquer them.[Needs Citation]
Verdan II	Verdan II was an Imperium world that became the site of a series of battles between the Death Strike Chapter and hordes of recidivists. The battles finally ended when the Death Strike performed an Exterminatus on the world.
Sepus Prime	Sepus Prime was an Imperial planet that was destroyed by Exterminatus after a Chaos insurrection led by its Governor Narbo.[1a] In place of a sky, it seemed Sepus Prime wore a dirty, sodden cloth, stained the same feculent shade of dun as the mud below. It sagged low over the fly-clad marshes, bleeding a desolate rain, crushing the mounds of dead and billowing around a shame-faced sun.- Description of Sepus Prime during the Chaos insurrection.[1a] Sepus Prime had several continents. Near the coastline were valleys with swamps and marshes inhabited by clouds of flies, and crook-backed trees. It was known to have low brown and yellow rainclouds that partially blocked the planet's pallid sun. The planet was described by Lieutenant Sorov as "rancid".[1a]
Arcadia (Eldar)	Little is known of Arcadia, fabled library planet of the Harlequins, though both Imperial and Chaos forces have set foot there. Warriors of the Blood Ravens under Gabriel Angelos and the Thousand Sons of Ahriman are recorded to have met in combat on the planet, as well as having combated the Harlequin inhabitants. The Harlequins eventually established an alliance of convenience with the Imperial Space Marines as, while the Blood Ravens were largely on the planet to recover Rhamah, a lost brother, the Thousand Sons were present to plunder the Arcadian Librarium and gain access to the Webway. While Ahriman was able to successfully steal texts from the library and enter the Webway, the Harlequins were able to deceive him about where the Webway Gate he entered would lead, preventing him from achieving his ultimate goal. Gabriel Angelos on the other hand, made the correct choice and was able to lead his forces through a Webway Gate back to the rest of his Company.[1a] The explored (by observers other than the Harlequins themselves) areas of Arcadia appear to be uniformly barren, either desert or windswept sandstone. The only known settlement on the world is hidden within a large rocky mesa, either dug out of the sandstone or built within a pre-existing valley - the craftsmanship of the dwelling is such that it is hard to tell which is the more likely. As a result the entire city is difficult to locate, appearing as natural rock formations to the casual observer, from both above and ground level. Ground approach to the city is through a maze-like series of canyons.[1b] The city itself is a wonder of Eldar architecture, its naturalistic forms decorated extensively with gargoyles, statues and dry fountains.[1b] It is the location of the Arcadian Librarium, the library of the Harlequins, one of the most extensive repositories of knowledge in existence.[1c]
Sleef	Sleef is a Dead World in the Calixis Sector. It is uninhabited and strange warp vibrations occur here. Calls have been made to make Sleef a fortification for use in the wars that plague the Calixis Sector but they have been overruled by the Inquisition for reasons never disclosed.
Lukekin	Lukekin is an Imperial Hive World, that has been struck by an Enslaver outbreak.
Kokytos	Kokytos is an Ice World of the Severan Dominate in The Periphery in the Calixis Sector. It is currently beset by the Imperium. The average daytime surface temperature on Kokytos is well below the freezing point of water. At night, it is significantly colder. Harsh winds continuously blow across its frigid surface. All of the planet’s oceans are believed to be entirely enclosed by the seemingly endless ice and snow. Ancient records indicate that Kokytos once had a robust population of indigenous life forms, including a broad variety of plants and animals capable of surviving under its extreme cold. Since the outbreak of war, sightings of these specimens have become progressively rarer. Some posit that the species are dying from the increasingly dangerous conditions, while others suggest that the surviving species have simply gone into isolation to escape the ongoing extreme cold.
Arach-Cyn	Arach-Cyn is an Eldar Crone World.[1b] It is located on the spinward border of the Gehennabyss Reaches, inside the Eye of Terror.[1a] It is home to the Tyrakesh Archeomarket.[1b]
Obsidia	My Lord? The High-Shaman of the Redwing tribe is at the gates again. He asks that we might call down the wrath of the mighty skyfire dragon on the Greyfoot tribe…— Chapter Serf Adulok Hol, Warden of the Hearth to the Master of the Sable Swords Chapter Obsidia is the homeworld of the Sable Swords Space Marine Chapter. Obsidia was formerly the homeworld of the Astral Knights chapter, before their near-complete annihilation in the battle with the Necron World Engine; afterwards, the High Lords of Terra ceded the Knights' fortress-monastery and chapter possessions to the Sable Swords.

Borvax V	Borvax V is in Imperial outpost Mining World, that lies perilously close to the Great Rift. This has caused Tzeentch Daemons to invade the world and they then began to rampage through the outpost's mining chambers. Now, however, Sororitas of the Order of Our Martyred Lady are on a quest to purge the capering Daemons, with archaic Paragon Warsuits.
Gulinglas	Gulinglas is a world of the Imperium. At some point prior to 241.M41 Gulinglas suffered from the predations of a cult. The cultists were known to remove their dead victims' eyes, due to their belief that the eyes were the windows of the soul.
Glenescrede Raptus	Glenescrede Raptus was an Imperium Forge World that suddenly exploded without warning during the Thirteenth Black Crusade. The detonation sent sent shock waves of trauma throughout the Glenid Swathe of Segmentum Pacificus and affected the dreams of every Psyker within eighteen standard Terra-Sols of Glenescrede Raptus's former position. Afterwards the Psykers all reported seeing the same terrifying vision of a hungry sentient Demon Sun, emerging from the void and some said they were also shown a vision of metallic tendrils seeking out amorphous treasures, within a forbidden vault. However, within a week of reporting these visions, each of these Psykers became the epicentre of a Daemonic incursion, that required dozens of Astra Militarum Regiments to cleanse. Though the importance of these dream visions are still unknown to the Imperium, the energy unleashed by Glenescrede Raptus's destruction has not diminished, but instead has only increased with the passing of each day. Worse still, according to the Navigators of House Balevolio, this energy seems to be moving towards the Sol System and is trailing a series of Warp Storms behind it.

Vonsha Smyde IX was among a series of worlds in the area that have suffered the same fate and the Inquisition may quarantine the worlds, rather than save them.
Bleakfrost	Bleakfrost is the site of a battle between Orks and the forces of the Imperium. During the battle, the Orks succeeded in overrunning the Imperium's last defensive line, but before they could press their attack, the Novamarines Chapter deployed a force of Devastators and Sternguard in front of the charging Greenskins. The Novamarines formed a mile-wide breach against the Orks and held firm against them for six hours until a reinforcement of Titans arrived and threw the Orks back with their firepower.
Delpha II	Delpha II is an Imperial Mining World, that is suffering a Genestealer Cult uprising.

Empire of the Severed	The Empire of the Severed is a Necron Dynasty based from the Tomb World of Sarkon but has since absorbed other worlds into its fold. As a result of radiation storms, the memory banks of every Necron interred within were wiped, rendering them mindless. Not realizing its own systems had also been damaged, the master program of Sarkon observed the quiet order it had brought to Sarkon and resolved to carry it to other worlds. The Master Program has since become a Necron Overlord known as the Sarkoni Emperor. The Severed has since overwhelmed the defenses of the tomb world of Takarak and absorbed it, along with three other Tomb Worlds, into its fold. The Sarkoni Emperor has since begun to extend its will across other non-Necron worlds, using Mindshackle Scarabs to bring any unruly creatures under its direct control. There are now reports of Necron armies issuing from Severed territory in great number, ethereal after-images dancing about their bodies as they seem to be driven by a single god-like will. These reports have led them to be dubbed the Haunted Legions.
UB-26	UB-26 is a Death World visited by Koulick Krieg.
Nalibraxis II	Nalibraxis II was the site of a battle between the forces of the Imperium and the Thousand Sons. The battle occurred during the Imperium's Yoladrian Crusade, in 632.M41, when Knights of House Cadmus and several Catachan Regiments were ambushed by the forces of the Thousand Sons in Nalibraxis II's swamps. In the ensuing massacre, a few battered Knights managed to escape the world to safety, while the Catachans were either killed or devolved into mindless Chaos Spawn. Once House Cadmus received word of what had happened to their Knights, the entire Household was determined to expunge the stain upon their honour and vowed to claim revenge on the forces of the Thousand Sons.

Orask	Orask is a Frontier World and Fortress World of the Imperium. Laying on the very edge of Ultima Segmentum, situated next to a nexus of Warp Routes, and bordering the mysterious Ghoul Stars, Orask garrisoned by a stoic breed of warlike people as well as Imperial Guard Regiments and even detachments from the Space Marines and Collegia Titanica. This formidable force is needed to man its planet-wide network of defenses, and Orask is frequently used by mankind as a base for expeditions into unknown parts of the Galaxy. The surface of the planet itself is largely devoid of life, consisting of open plains blasted by war. Because of its location, Orask has suffered repeated attacks over the years. These have included a previously unknown xenos race, Dark Mechanicum forces under arch-Heretek Cykor Marlowe, and Chaos renegades. However, its most serious threat came in 977.M41 with a Tyranid invasion, sparking the Orask Wars.
Okku Station	Okku Station was the site of a battle between the Imperium and Blackshields, during the Horus Heresy.
Sibb's World	Sibb's World was where the Blood Angels Chapter defeated a Tzeentch Warband after two months of battle.
Ulan Hûda	Ulan Huda was a moon and fallen Forge World of the Eastern Fringe during the Great Crusade and Horus Heresy.[2a] Long hidden in the storms that haunt the edge of the Galaxy, the world had long devoted itself to forbidden technologies that allowed the planet itself to move through the Warp in order to escape the predations of Xenos and other horrors. By this means, they were able to fall upon and consume other worlds at the edge of the Imperium, tearing them apart to supply its forges and leaving only shattered systems in its wake. They operated a Titan Legion known as the Legio Phasma.[2a] Sometime during the Great Crusade the world was encountered by Konrad Curze, who was able to sign a secret agreement with the planet. During the Thramas Crusade they sided with the Night Lords and attacked loyalist worlds.[2a] The Dark Angels under Lion El'Jonson later boarded the world as it consumed Thramas, finding its horrifying lord known as the Witch of Thramas. Thanks to the sacrifice of allied White Scars, Ulan Huda was grievously wounded when its generators were destroyed and forced to flee into the Warp.[2a] Several reports during the Scouring speak of a world similar to Ulan Huda being seen in the farthest reaches of the Imperium, vanishing before forces could arrive. It is said to now lurk somewhere in the darkness beyond the galactic rim.[2b]
Xandros	Xandros is the site of an ongoing battle between the Ultramarines and Necrons.
Bradur IV	Bradur IV is a world of the Imperium. It was once garrisoned by the 3rd Vorradion Astra Militarum Regiment, whose Commander was appointed as the world's Planetary Governor. The Commander later rebelled against the Imperium but, less than a hundred days later, the Blood Drinkers Chapter's Third Company arrived in Bradur IV's orbit. The Company launched a direct assault on the Commander's fortress and had already been given orders to take no prisoners and accept no surrender terms.
Exterminatus Issue 6	Exterminatus was a Fanatic Press Magazine dedicated to the Inquisitor (Game)[1a] It was dedicated to presenting new releases, rules for games and models, and painting guides.[1b] This article or article section is based on information from a Fanatic Press publication such as Fanatic Magazine or one of its predecessors (e.g. The Citadel Journal, Necromunda Magazine, etc.). These publications regularly featured articles submitted by hobbyists, and as such, their content may or may not be in contradiction to established background lore.
Bora Culpa	Bora Culpa is an Imperial planet that suffered from a Necron harvesting. Scythe Class Harvest Ships and Shroud Class Light Cruisers were seen in orbit before the population disappeared. A later investigation headed by the Space Wolves found the planet deserted.
A Rose Watered With Blood (Short Story)	A Rose Watered with Blood is a short story in the Horus Heresy series written by Aaron Dembski-Bowden. The Conquerer, flagship of the World Eaters Space Marine Legion, has changed. As it makes the long journey to Terra, the vagaries of the warp – and the infernal nature of the beast chained in the bowels of the warship – are altering the very fabric of the vessel. For Lotara Sarrin, long-serving shipmaster of the once-proud craft, and her human crew, the ship has become dangerous. Some think it's trying to kill them. Sarrin has another theory... and it's one she likes even less.
Khelrantyr	Khelrantyr is a Necron Tomb World that was settled by Humans, but later began to awaken in M42. The Overlord Anrakyr the Traveller discovered this, though, and his forces quickly squashed any Human resistance. Afterwards, Anrakyr made his way to the entrance of Khelrantyr's Tomb complex, to meet with its awakening Necrons. Before he could enter it, however, Tyranids suddenly invaded the world and began attacking the Overlord's forces.
Phobos (Moon)	Phobos is one of two Moon of Mars, capital of the Adeptus Mechanicus. Phobos is a gun-studded world, used as an orbital fortress which protects the Red Planet.

Crows World	Crows World,[3a] formerly Fief 771/38/qz,[2a] is a Civilized World of the Imperium, located in the Pale Stars.[3a] In the Great Crusade, the planet was conquered by the 771st Expedition Fleet (which included Raven Guard elements).[2b] It was officially designated "Fief 771/38/qz" and assigned as a Adeptus Astartes Recruiting World to the Raven Guard Legion.[2a] It held this status at least until the Horus Heresy when the Pale Stars were devastated by Loyalists, Traitors, and other forces.[2a][2c] At some point after the Horus Heresy, the planet became known as "Crows World".[3a] At one point, the system of Crows World was the site of a brief campaign for the Ultramarines Chapter against Eldar pirates. After the Xenos were defeated, the Ultramarines took Aspirants from Crows World.
Cressida	Cressida is a Dead World that was the site of a Chaos-fuelled rebellion. Once a productive world, Cressida was gradually transformed into an Ice World by the influence of Chaos. The responding Imperial Guard Regiments included the Royal Validians and the Valhallan Ice Warriors, who fought a losing battle to hold the Chaos forces at bay while as much of the planet's population was evacuated. After this was done, the planet was subjected to exterminatus.
Keletros	Keletros is the homeworld of the Skull Bearers Space Marine Chapter.
Mandragora	Mandragora is a Tomb World of the Necrons and crownworld of the Sautekh Dynasty, located along the Eastern Fringe. When the War in Heaven ended, Mandragora's stasis-crypts were filled to capacity with some of the finest Necron warriors. Since the reawakening of the Necrons from their long slumber, Mandragora has again become a hub of Necron activity. Phaeron Imotekh has dispatched legions of Necrons from the world against the Ork Warboss Snagratoof, whose warband occupied the region's surrounding tomb worlds. Since then, the armies of Mandragora have proved to be an ever-present threat on the Imperium's eastern borders.
Plague zombie	Plague zombies are victims of a virulent and deadly infection known as the "Zombie Plague" or the "Curse of Unbelief", which is spread by the minions of the Plague God Nurgle. Not only do the afflicted die as the result of the disease but they return as undead, mindlessly devoted to adding their former comrades-in-arms to their number. The Zombie Plague is one of the many foul contagions spread by the followers of Nurgle and it is a combination of a Chaos infection and a physical malaise. The disease is also a spiritual contagion as much as physical one - as it afflicts those lacking in utter faith. There are hundreds of different strains of the Plague and it degenerates those infected by the disease, although a portion of the victim's life essence is retained by the body even after physical death has occurred. Plague Zombies act like archetypal zombies - mindless, shambling and cannibalistic; they are hard to kill and generally require a traumatic blow to the head to kill them. It has been observed that some Psykers appear to be able to control the actions of the zombie hordes. On affected worlds, a once-loyal man may survive by pledging new allegiance to the Chaos Gods. This is problematic in the extreme for any Imperial reclamations, because, as well as the zombies themselves, they are forced to fight hordes of cultists who have had plenty of time to take over the planet's defenses.

The Ultramarines soon followed and ensured that Zymran's forces didn't gain a stronghold on the world.
Ardium	Ardium is an Imperium Hive World and is part of the stellar Realm of Ultramar. In the 13th Black Crusade, Ardium was one of the many worlds of Ultramar that were invaded by the Chaos forces of Abaddon the Despoiler. During its invasion, the Bitter Sons Warband captured one of Ardium's subterranean Hives, but the reborn Primarch Roboute Guilliman later led the Ultramarines to free the world and destroyed the Warband. Ardium was again the site of major invasion of Nurgle forces and serious fighting between the Ultramarines and Chaos during the Plague Wars.
Nedicta Secundus	Nedicta Secundus is a Cardinal World of the Imperium. The Celebrants Space Marine Chapter were tasked with protecting the priceless holy relics of Nedicta Secundus from a possible attack from Hive Fleet Kraken. This resulted in Chapter being unable to make their garrison rotation on the planet Phaethon IV, a task that would fall to the Crimson Consuls' Second and Fourth Companies and lead to their destruction as war fell on Phaethon IV.
Orbel Quill	Orbel Quill is an Agri World in the Calixis Sector. Orbel Quill is an oddly serene, pastoral world of shepherd flocks and herding where, curiously, no one lives beyond the age of forty years standard. Often thought to be a rumour or a joke, the "death threshold" of Orbel Quill is quite real. Visitors and travellers must beware, as often they are far above the age of forty in sidereal term. Anyone forty or over is stricken with a terminal decline and dies within thirty-six hours, even visitors who have amassed their years in ship-time. Many speculate that the planet is governed by some deep-seated system that combs out what it perceives to be the elderly.[2b] Certain facts are evident: though no one has managed to identify what it is that kills the over-forties on Orbel Quill, it does so without exception.[2b]
Tagia Prime	Tagia Prime was the site of a battle involving Tallarn Regiments of the Imperial Army during the Great Crusade.
Neo Baku	Neo Baku is an Imperial Hive World.
Liberty V	Liberty V is an Imperial world of twisted mould-glades, that consist of giant mushrooms. An Astra Militarum Kill Team Unit made a heroic last stand against Aeldari raiders, when the world was attacked by the Xenos. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here. Liberty V was among the four scenic gaming tables that were created by the Games Workshop employees Jason Buyaki, Chad Mierzwa, Chris McPherson, Stuart Spengler, Jason Foley, and Ernie Diaz. These tables were featured on an older version of the company's website and in Warhammer 40,000 4th Edition Rulebook.
Heretic Astartes Fief World	Heretic Astartes Fief World are worlds that are part of the domain of Chaos Warbands or Traitor Legions. They provide various services, such as being sources of Aspirants or resources. Fief Worlds also raised Solar Auxilia Regiments for the Traitor Legions, during the Great Crusade and Horus Heresy.
Zordion	Zordion is a Desert Death World, that lies in the Imperium Nihilus. It is one of the worlds the Wolfspear use for their Aspirants to undergo the Chapter's version of the Test of Morkai. Those cast into this desolate place must master the monstrous transformations triggered by the Canis Helix and reach the Wolfspear's drop zone. While doing so, the Aspirants must also deal with the parched deserts and the Xenos horrors that erupt from the sands around them.
Industrial World	Industrial Worlds (also known as Manufactory Worlds) are factory worlds where the whole planet is devoted to manufacturing or mining. The populations are sparse as most of the labor is carried out mechanically. In the case of industrial mining worlds they must be considerably mineral-rich in order to justify the logistical and development efforts. Despite the fact that an Industrial World may have ties to the Adeptus Mechanicus, they do not own these worlds like they do with Forge Worlds.
Praesteum's Forge	Praesteum's Forge was the third stage of the Pilgrimage of Fire before it became a Dead World. During her War of Faith, Saint Katherine purged the world of the Daughters of the Pallid Lord and set up shrines and temples to the God-Emperor in their place. The planet suffered Exterminatus after the opening of the Great Rift. It is located in Imperium Nihilus.
Darillia	Darillia is known for raising the Dernhelm Imperial Guard Regiments.
Kuluth	Kuluth is a War World in the Malfian Sub-sector of the Calixis Sector.
Kao-li	Kao-li is a Forbidden/Xenos World, located in the Calixis Sector.
Sansha XII	Sansha XII is an Imperial world, that was invaded by a Word Bearers Warband in M42. They then began to enact a grave ritual in the ruins of a mountain-top basilica. As Sansha XII is close to the Sol System, the Adeptus Custodes and Sisters of Silence acted quickly and destroyed the Warband before the ritual was completed.
Kalidar I	Kalidar I is the first planet of the Kalidar System. Kalidar I, along with its sister planets Kalidar II and Kalidar III, are planetary husks notable for their non-natural orbital pattern - all three orbit Kalidar with equidistant placing at 3AU. Data pertaining to these planets has been suppressed by the Inquisition.
Gunpoint	Gunpoint is a Hive World in the Calixis Sector. The planet is now a byword for failure.
Klaihn	Klaihn is an Ice World held by the Eldar that contains a sacred temple dedicated to the Goddess Isha. When a vast Imperial force comprised of the 52nd and 124th Valhallan regiments of the Imperial Guard invaded Klaihn in 909.M41, the Eldar of Craftworlds Biel-Tan and Lugganath united to stop them from possessing the temple. What was intended to be a fast strike to wipe out the Guard, however, turned into a protracted and exhausting conflict, due partially to the strange, ethereal blizzards located on Klaihn and the stubbornness of the Valhallans themselves. Eventually, the Eldar fought through the Valhallans and reached the temple, where they encircled it with their Ghost Warriors, but a Warp-blizzard soon brought new terrors to the battlefield, in the form of a wave of Slaaneshi Daemons. Faced with this new enemy, an uneasy alliance was struck between the Eldar and the Imperial Guard to purge the planet of the frost-blighted Daemons. However, the Eldar had a greater plan, and lured the Daemons and Valhallans into a bloody conflict against each other that greatly reduced the numbers of each. Though the Imperial Guard were finally victorious against the Daemons, the Eldar's Ghost Warriors easily routed the exhausted Valhallan survivors.
Klithaine	Klithaine was an Exodite World. In 366.M40, the Khorne Warband known as the Wrath fell upon Klithaine and in just three months reduced the paradise to a blood-drenched hell. Though the forces of Craftworld Biel-Tan attempted to stop the Warband, they were slaughtered by the Wrath, who then devoured the Eldar's corpses in a horrific feast.
Gonoria Prime Rebellion	The Gonoria Prime Rebellion was an Imperial Guard uprising which broke out on the Gonoria Prime planet with the aid of the Chaos Space Marines. The Imperium sent the army with at least one Imperial Guard Tank Company to suppress a rebellion.
Pavar V	Pavar V is an Imperial planet. The planet features continent-spanning forests along with some cities. The Pavarian 3rd Armoured Regiment fought on this planet with some unknown enemy.
Teris IX	Teris IX is an Imperium world that was brought into Compliance by the Space Wolves Legion during the Great Crusade.

Durmian VII	The planet Durmian VII has a surface composed of boiling sulphur.
Proxima Trantor	Proxima Trantor is home to dead cities and has been Quarantined by the Imperium.
Shemnoch	Shemnoch was a Necron Tomb World that was invaded by the forces of the Iron Hands and Brazen Claws Chapters. The ensuing battle saw Shemnoch's Necron Dynasty defeated.
Aten III	Aten III is an Imperial Industrial World.
Ohmsworld	Ohmsworld is a Death World / Hive World of the Severan Dominate in The Periphery in the Calixis Sector. A dense and toxic atmosphere makes Ohmsworld inimical to human life. None visit the world or choose to live within its countless small spires because of the hideous environment and the dramatic weather. Instead, most residents are the descendants of colonists who were compelled to live upon the planet due to its unusual mineral assets. This is because the atmospheric contaminants make Ohmsworld a valuable holding. Through careful atmosphere filtration, the inhabitants can obtain several chemicals and compounds key in the creation of Adamantine. Nearly all of Ohmsworld’s human population dwell among the countless hive spires that dot the planet’s surface. Though each is far less populous than a typical Imperial hive city, many of these delicate spires are every bit as tall and nearly as broad. This is largely because the enormous structures are little more than air filtration systems. A vast network of delicate tendrils, constructed of near microscopic tendrils, which resemble minute feathers, filter the world’s atmosphere.
Holy Synod	The Holy Synod is the ruling body of the Ecclesiarchy. Based on Terra, the Holy Synod consists of the Ministorum's Cardinals, each of whom rules over a diocese. The Holy Synod periodically holds Ecclesiastical Conclaves in which Cardinals from all over the Imperium journey to Terra and discuss issues concerning the Ecclesiarchy. As the Holy Synod determines religious policy in the Imperium, it is extremely influential and one or more of the Cardinals on the Holy Synod may represent the organization on the High Lords of Terra. Alongside the Holy Synod based on Terra, another ruling body known as the Synod Ministra exists on the Cardinal World of Ophelia VII. Although the Holy Synod on Terra remains the supreme ruling body of the Ecclesiarchy, the Synod Ministra acts as a secondary governing body. Located further from Terra, the Synod Ministra relays and disseminates the dictates of the Ecclesiarchy of the Holy Synod, enforcing the laws of the Ecclesiarchy. Secondly, it provides a defense against the manipulation of the Ecclesiarchy by other Imperial organizations such as the Administratum or even a single individual within the ranks of the Ministorum itself. This ensures that never again will a High Lord or an Ecclesiarch have total power over the Ecclesiarchy, as was the case with Goge Vandire during the Age of Apostasy.
Laymon (Planet)	Laymon is an Imperium planet. It is the third planet in the Amarah system.
Bloodfall	Bloodfall was the Homeworld of the Red Wolves Chapter. During the Horus Heresy, it was attacked by the Night Lord forces of the Prince of City's Edge. He would have scoured it of life, like he had done to several other worlds, had the Space Wolves of Gunnar Thorolfsson not come to its aid. Gunnar had been waging an independent campaign against the Night Lords and vowed to protect Bloodfall from their predations. It was not until reinforcements, led by Jarl Jorin Bloodhowl arrived, though, that the Prince and his forces were killed. Millennia later, however, Bloodfall was destroyed by a splinter of Hive Fleet Leviathan, during the Third Tyrannic War.
Brezal III	Brezal III was the site of a battle that saw the Blood Ravens and Storm Wardens fight the forces of the Eldar. During the battle, a disastrous plan put forth by the Storm Wardens Captain in command of the Space Marines, resulted in the deaths of two squads of Blood Ravens and nearly half a Company of Storm Wardens. This debacle caused the Blood Ravens Chapter to develop an intense distrust of the Storm Wardens' tactics and strategies, which lasts to this day.
Hive Fleet Dagon	Dagon is a minor Tyranid Hive Fleet, currently active in the Eastern Fringes and the Jericho Reach region, mainly in the Orpheus Salient. A splinter fleet of Hive Fleet Behemoth, it detached before the latter's destruction in the First Tyrannic War. Dagon launched a surprise attack on Imperial forces of the Achilus Crusade in 817.M41, sowing widespread death and confusion thanks to the Shadow in the Warp. The Hive Fleet has consumed at least nine inhabited worlds while immediately threatening six more. The fate of more then twenty other systems lost in the Shadow in the Warp remains unknown. Herisor was the first world to fall to Dagon, followed by attacks on Freya and Zanatov's Harbour. Since the discovery of Freya's ruination in early 814.M41, Deathwatch forces became aware of the Tyranid incursion. Only with their help has the Achilus Crusade managed to stall Dagon's advance. Currently, the Hive Fleet is well supplied with bio-mass, and as such it represents a substantial threat to the Jericho Reach.[2a]
Kotrax	Kotrax is an Imperial world.
Zel Secundus	Zel Secundus is a Death World in the Calixis Sector. Zel Secundus is a scorchingly hot world, dry and desiccated and scoured constantly by powerful storms of sand and grit. The atmosphere is poisonous and corrosive, and any man caught outside without proper protective gear will either have the flesh rasped from his bones by the wind or his lungs filled with toxic gases. Geologically unstable, Zel Secundus is beset by constant tremors and quakes, and volcanic eruptions are an almost daily event. Scattered across the surface of the planet are clusters of smoking vents and steaming fumaroles, usually surrounded by bubbling pools of magma or highly toxic lakes of super–hot water full of dissolved salts, heavy metals, and other chemicals.
Pyr	Pyr is a world of the Imperium. It raises Astra Militarum Regiments known to wield Flame weapons.
The Seventh Serpent (Novella)	The Seventh Serpent is a limited-release novella written by Graham McNeill and part of the Horus Heresy series. It was originally released in November 2014 at the Black Library Weekender III. It was available for pre-order online December 5th 2014. Since the near-destruction of the Iron Hands, Raven Guard and Salamanders on Isstvan V, scattered warbands from these ‘shattered Legions’ have waged a guerrilla war on Horus’ forces across the galaxy. Now, the crew of the Sisypheum are drawn into a covert assault on a hidden Alpha Legion outpost – an assault orchestrated by none other than the infamous warleader Shadrak Meduson himself. But what does Meduson really hope to make from such a bold move against the sons of Alpharius, arguably the undisputed masters of deception...?
Kronus	Kronus is an Imperial planet and a Tomb World where the Dark Crusade took place.[1a] It was also part of the Shadow Crusade during Horus Heresy. Kronus is a Tomb World, the Necrons went in to stasis on Kronus after their battle with the Old Ones over 60 million years ago.[1o] During Horus Heresy, commanded by Eliphas the Inheritor, Word Bearers alongside World Eaters invaded the Deimos Peninsula area of the planet, desecrating it and butchering most of the occupants. This prompted a counter-attack from Ultramarines. It turned out to be a trap however, and the small loyalist force was slaughtered.
Bakus III	Bakus III is a Hive World. The Cadian 78th Armoured Regiment fought there with some unknown enemy.
Tekarn	Tekarn is a world of the Imperium. It is known to contribute regiments for the Imperial Guard.
Jupiter	Jupiter is a Forge World and Mining World in the Sol System and, as with all forge-worlds, it is a vast manufacturing center. It is the base of the orbital Jovian shipyards. The space docks and workshops that circle Jupiter, like a ring of moons, are home to the millions of technomat and drone Servitors that work under the supervision of Artisan and Rune Priest Tech-priests to build the Imperial Navy's warships. It is known that as far back as the Horus Heresy, Jupiter held industrial and colonial cohorts with clouds of satellites along with Trojan asteroids containing human colonies, factories along with forges. The Jovian colonies were powered by the radiation that surged from the massive planet and much of the industry fed on the mineral riches that had been yielded from centuries of exploitation, with its full potential having not been fully exhausted. Due to these factors, Jupiter served as Terra's shipyards and its skies were always filled with starships with spacedocks and fabricatories around the various moons that worked tirelessly to construct anything from single manned Raven Interceptors to gargantuan hulls of Emperor Class Battleships.
Telemachus	Telemachus is a Forge World of the Imperium.
Paraxus	Paraxus is a recruitment world for the Sons of Guilliman Chapter.
Houns Ashemashea	Houns Ashemashea is an Eldar Maiden World that was infested by Xenos, until they were killed by the forces of Craftworld Saim-Hann.
Merrand	Merrand was the site of a battle between Orks and the Vostroyan 68th Firstborn Regiment.
Holst (Signus VI)	Holst, also referred to as Signus VI, is the sixth of the seven planets of the Signus Cluster.[1a] Formerly an Imperial Hive World / Ice World, it was conquered and turned into a Daemon World by forces of Chaos sometime before the events of the Signus Campaign.[1b][1c] The first encounter of the campaign took place here, and resulted in Primarch Sanguinius calling an Exterminatus on the planet.[1c] The remains of it were left quarantined alongside the rest of the system after the campaign was finished.[1d]
Mordant Acid Dogs	The Mordant Acid Dogs are the Imperial Guard Regiments recruited from Mordant Prime. Mordant is a mining world where the population lives in the subterranean tunnels. The conditions within the tunnels are harsh, where criminal gangs are the only authority and citizens must prey upon each other for the meagre resources. Only the skilled miners, part of a very old organization of clans, do not suffer from the poverty of the world. The miners contract local manual labour, paying just enough to allow the most basic of living conditions in the shacks of the shanty caverns.[Needs Citation] The Mordant regiments are generally formed from those that cannot live on the miserable payment of the mining clans or who earn the wrath of one of the criminal gangs.[Needs Citation]
Rovanat IV	Rovanat IV is a World of the Imperium. The Inquisition once put down a Chaos cult uprising on Rovanat IV, with the aid of several groups of militia.
Nurth	Nurth is a Dead World.[1d] Discovered during the Great Crusade by the 670th Expedition Fleet, Nurth was a lost Human colony world. The population refused the offer of entry into the Imperium of Man, resulting in a drawn-out compliance action that eventually culminated in the death of the entire world.[1d] When contacted by the Imperium, Nurth was a low-tech, largely desert planet, with geographic features fairly typical of such an environment. An exception to this was the harbour of Mon Lo, home of a city of the same name. The harbour, while appearing perfectly natural to the ordinary onlooker, was actually an entirely artificial construction, the entire area heavily landscaped by the Xenos organisation known as the Cabal some eleven thousand, eight hundred and twenty-six years before the arrival of the Imperium on the world. Before natural environmental change filled the harbour with water, the bay was a giant landing pad and spaceport facility (or 'halting station') for the Cabal. As such, a detailed orbital scan of Mon Lo will reveal features and layout similar to that found on other worlds where Cabal waystations were built.[1c]
Pylar	Pylar is the seventh planet of the Modren's Realm System. Pylar is a frozen ball located at the outskirts of the system. Due to its near-lack of atmosphere and frozen surface it is not worth harvesting the mineral resources or establishing a colony here.
Hellicore	Hellicore was the site of a victory for the Imperium against the forces of Horus during the Heresy.
Prassrum	Prassrum is an Imperial world.
Carnac Campaign	The Carnac Campaign was a battle in 999.M41 between the Necrons of Anrakyr the Traveller and an Eldar warhost under Farseer Starbane. Anrakyr had come to the Tomb World of Carnac expecting to reawaken it to his cause, only to find it infested with Eldar Exodites. Realizing the forces at his immediate disposal were outmatched, Anrakyr commissioned aid from Mandragora, Gidrim, Trakonn, and forces from Solemnace led by Trazyn the Infinite himself. However, by this point, the Eldar Craftworld Alaitoc had arrived to reinforce the Exodites under Farseer Starbane, who sought revenge against the Necrons for his earlier humiliation at the hands of Imotekh the Stormlord. The Eldar first attempted to stall the Necrons with hit-and-run attacks under the command of the Ranger Illic Nightspear and struck at Anrakyr and his closest allies, but Anrakyr was able to avoid the assassination attempt due to information provided by Orikan the Diviner and the squad of rangers was ambushed by Deathmarks.
Volchis IV	Volchis IV was the site of a battle for the Blood Angels Chapter.
Perditia	Perditia is an Iron Warriors-held world that was invaded by the Dark Angels Chapter, though the final outcome of that battle is unknown.
Baih'Rus	Baih'Rus is a Colony World in the Eastern Fringe. It is located roughly two days travel from the world of Equixus.
Gruss	Gruss is the sixth planet of the Modren's Realm System. Gruss is a planet of oceans and forests of petrified wood. The only indigenous life forms of the planet live in the oceans and Vir Modren had several floating platforms placed there to harvest plants and animal life as food sources for the other planets of Modren's Realm. The atmosphere of the Gruss is thin, but the frequent winds may send sudden storms through the woods, creating strange discordant wails as the wind passes through the hollow trees' trunks.
By the Dying Light	By the Dying Light – is a name of the incident occurred in 477.M39 in the Haark System. By the machinations of the servants of Tzeentch, the twin stars of the system were transformed into Warp Rifts and the population went insane. The Warp rifts also triggered the dual-nova event. Strike Force Ultra of the Black Consuls Chapter, commanded by Captain Varnor, descended to Haark to fight the Daemons and madmen and succeeded in recovering the sacred relics from the planet just moments before the stars exploded and destroyed the system.
Etiamnun III	Etiamnun III is a barren and airless world notable only for being the site of an Imperial Reclusiam that was attacked and sacked by a warband of the Thousand Sons Chaos Space Marines. Located in the Eastern Fringe, Etiamnun was reputedly gifted to the Imperium by the Eldar of Altansar Craftworld. The Reclusiam built there was only ever sparsely staffed by Imperial scholars, but was significant in that not only did it contain an inert Webway Gate, it was also under the covert protection of the Order Psykana of the Blood Ravens Adeptus Astartes. Aside from this compact, the Reclusiam had no particular defensive capabilities, instead relying on secrecy and obscurity. This strategy proved flawed when the existence of Etiamnun III was discovered by Ahzek Ahriman of the Thousand Sons. As part of his grand design to enter the Black Library of Chaos, Ahriman dispatched a warband under the command of the Sorceror Mordant Hex to conquer the Etiamnun Reclusiam. Hex was able to gain dominion over the Reclusiam easily, his Six-Cursed opened the shelters to the cold vacuum of the planet's surface, throwing out the inhabitants to certain death and remorselessly massacring those who tried to hide. Then Hex secured the Webway Gate, allowing the Thousand Sons to penetrate that Eldar domain. By the time a relief force despatched by the Order Psykana arrived at the Reclusiam, the traitor marines were long gone; the only trace of their presence a discarded copy of the Tome of Karebennian, an Eldar text that is reputed to be a guidebook of sorts to various Webway routes that lead to the Black Library.
Jormungandr	Hive Fleet Jormungandr is a small Tyranid Hive Fleet that entered the Imperium from the North East of the Ultima Segmentum. This Hive Fleet specialized in ambush and tunneling tactics. It was thought largely destroyed by Admiral Vortigern Hanroth at the Battle of the Black Nebula in late 995.M41, though remnants still endure. Jormungandr did not begin as a particularly large Hive Fleet, but swiftly accumulated a massive pool of biomass by preying upon unprotected worlds. Hive Fleet Jormungandr spread out around the Thalassi Sector like some monstrous serpent and, less than two years after its first recorded attack, had effectively sealed off the entire sector. In the three months that followed, Jormungandr remained slowly twisting in space, defending itself when attacked, but otherwise content to be left alone. Then, suddenly and without warning, the coils of Jormungandr began to constrict. Jormungandr favoured subtler methods than the siege tactics displayed by the other Hive Fleets. Its bio-vessels rarely entered planetary orbit. Instead, Jormungandr snared asteroids and other space debris, hurling them at the target world and launching Mycetic Spores in concert. The devastation wreaked by the bombardment ensured that a greater proportion of the Spores make planet-fall. Each Mycetic Spore that landed unleashed a Ravener brood, or sometimes a Mawloc or Trygon. These immediately buried underground and went dormant to avoid detection. Only when the infestation reached critical mass did the Hive Fleet send the psychic stimuli to awaken its slumbering serpents, timing the resultant planet-wide destruction with the arrival of its Hive Ships in orbit. The Hive Ships would then deliver Genestealers and Carnifexes to the surface to escalate the havoc.
Ho'sarn	Ho'sarn was a Tau colony world evacuated in 902.M41 when Hive Fleet Gorgon invaded the Tau Empire. As Gorgon neared the Kel'shan Sept, the Kel'shan Ethereal council ordered the evacuation of all the colony worlds between Ka'mais, a colony world earlier invaded by Gorgon, and Kel'shan. However, the evacuation fleet from Ho'sarn was ambushed by Prowler drone ships and slaughtered. More than three hundred Tau vessels were destroyed in less than three hours, but some manage to reach the abandoned mining facilities on the edge of the Ho'sarn system. However, they were all killed when Tyranid forces arrived two days later.
Fell Core	Fell Core is a Dead World, formerly of the Imperium. The population of Fell Core began to rebel against the Imperium and the Imperial Guard was brought to the planet to put down the rebellion (among them the 35th Octobian Regiment). During the fighting the Guard would discover that a Genestealer Cult was behind the rebellion and the Space Marines would come to Fell Core, to destroy the Genestealer infestation. They succeeded, but it was too late as Tyranid spores would soon rain down on the planet. Though the Imperium fought to save Fell Core, the Tyranids soon overwhelmed them and what survivors could be saved were evacuated, before an Exterminatus was carried out, destroying the planet.
Gorkamorka	Gorkamorka, also known as Angelis, is a world on the far reaches of the Ultima Segmentum, in the Ghost Stars region. Angelis was being surveyed by the Imperial vessel Eternal Vigilance in 344–345 M35 when an Ork Space Hulk crashed into it, creating a massive canyon dubbed "Da Skid" by the Orks, and irradiating the landscape of the surrounding area, including the base station of the Imperial survey team who had been investigating the planet's complex of pyramid structures, and attempting to determine the reason for the apparently artificially caused lack of any living organisms, right down to bacterial and viral levels, on the planet.[1a] The surviving Orks set about building a new ship, to leave the planet and rejoin their Waaagh!. Unfortunately for the Orks, rivalries broke out over which Ork god the ship resembled, and the construction process slowed dramatically as tribes fought for resources and territory. The vessel was eventually destroyed in the fighting. After the destruction of the ship, both sides decided to band together and name the vessel "Gorkamorka", meaning that it could look like either of the Ork gods, Gork and Mork.[1b]
Brun	Brun is an Ocean World of the Imperium whose sole island, Fury Island, was the site of the Blood Ravens' earliest known battle. As such, the Blood Ravens consider Fury Island to be sacred ground, and long for any chance to fight there.
Rygar	Rygar was the site where the Space Wolves Great Company of the Wolf Lord Leif Snowfang clashed with the Ork hordes of Warboss Rokbad Necksnapper. During the battle, Snowfang was killed by a lucky blow from Necksnapper, and the Wolf Guard Harald Deathwolf was forced to take command of the Great Company. He then rallied them to victory over the Orks and afterwards, Deathwolf was voted to succeed Snowfang as the Great Company's new Wolf Lord.
Schrödinger VII	Schrödinger VII is an Ice World belonging to the Necron Sautekh Dynasty. It was a world of the Imperium until it was claimed by the forces of Imotekh, following the defeat of Black Templar forces under Helbrecht in 930.M41.
Cadian Gate	The Cadian Gate was an area of calm space leading in and out of the Eye of Terror. It was located to the galactic south-east of the Eye, and is the only predictably stable way out. It was therefore a site of frequent raids by the forces of Chaos. It was not the only stable exit from the Eye; the Arx gap is another way to get out, although it was somewhat less stable. The Cadian Gate existed because of the blackstone pylons on the surface of Cadia, which had the effect of strengthening the barrier between realspace and the Warp. During the 13th Black Crusade, Cadia was destroyed after Abaddon the Despoiler crashed a Blackstone Fortress into it. The destruction of Cadia and its pylons caused the Cadian Gate to collapse and the formation of the Cicatrix Maledictum.
Vernalis	Vernalis is a mining world in the Segmentum Obscurus. The planet was the site of the battle known as the Scouring of Vernalis. Vernalis is a barren, lifeless world. The landscape is composed of jagged flint and crumbling shale the hue of corpse flesh, and presided over by a lifeless gray sky. The planet features vast oceans of oil, which imbue the air with fumes and a permanent petrochemical odour. The planet's name means "springtide" in an ancient and forgotten Terran language. It is unknown if the reference to spring in the planet's name signified a collective dream for a bright, habitable future on behalf of the original colonists, a reminder of better worlds, or if, in fact, the planet had once been lush with life as the name implies. The possibility that the name was chosen out of a sense of pure, dark irony has also been suggested.
Zweihan's World	Zweihan's World is a Hive World in the Malfian Sub-sector of the Calixis Sector. It is famous for St Castor the Obviate. A cool and temperate planet, much of Zweihan’s World’s surface is covered in water, resulting in a rather damp planetary climate. The planet is circled by several long, mountainous and almost serpentine continents, which are straddled by four hive cities near the equator. Zweihan’s World’s most notable feature is not on the planet, but around it: a vast ring system made up of the shattered remains of what used to be a large moon. Now the rock rings are mined, bringing the planet impressive mineral wealth. It is led by Governor Malaki Vess, who does not wish to see ruin be brought to his world through excessive industrialization or mining.
Plutol	Plutol is a planet, which had Abaddon's wrath visited upon it. When the Priests of a wilderness shrine refused to bow to his authority, Abaddon killed every other human upon the planet before personally visiting the shrine and forcing the priests to eat the bodies of those they had once prayed for.
Coralax	Coralax is the Homeworld of the Knights of the Raven Chapter.[1a] It is located beyond Imperial boundaries outside of Ultima Segmentum.[1b] To the inhabitants of this bleak Feudal World, the Knights of the Raven are mythological figures who descend from the heavens to spirit away their greatest young warriors.[1a]
The Dawn Hammer	The Dawn Hammer was a battle in 766.M37 between Imperial Fists Strike Force Ultra and Warboss Sunspitta in the early stages of the Ork invasion of the planet Rylan. Led by Captain Myriadon of the Imperial Fists 1st Company, Strike Force Ultra landed on the surface of Sunspitta's space hulk during the first stage of the Ork assault on the Imperial world of Rylan. Imperial Fists Terminators broke through the Orks right to the rusted power core of the giant spaceship and blew it up. The doomed space hulk exploded just at the moment of descent through the atmosphere of Rylan, turning more than half of the Orks' ships into flaming wreckage.
Praedis Zeta	Praedis Zeta is an Alpha-Class Hive world of the Imperium and homeworld of the Imperius Reavers Chapter. Praedis Zeta is situated eighty light years from the Forge World of Hypnoth on the Eastern Fringe. It has long supplied Hypnoth with raw materials and as a result of its importance is heavily populated, with its volcanic surface covered in polluted hive cities that house billions. However, Praedis Zeta is not like other worlds of the Vidar Sector for it is not overseen by a noble family but rather an Imperial Governor known as Holt. The reason for this stricter form of rule is due to the fact that the planet is also the homeworld of the Imperius Reavers Space Marine Chapter. Thus none dare step out of line as punishment is historically very harsh.
Kalimant	Kalimant contains a nest of the Hrud Xenos species. The Ordo Xenos Inquisitor Lord Falx once infiltrated the world, but was forced to hide from the Hrud by remaining hidden beneath the nest. She would have to remain hidden there for a week, before finally managing to escape off world. However while Falx evaded the Hurd's grasp, being so close to their entropic fields for so long, left her severely aged.
Carcharias	Carcharias is an Ice World and homeworld of the Crimson Consuls Space Marine Chapter. It has three moons known as De Vere, Thusa Major and Thusa Minor. The Crimson Consuls used three ruined Hives, collectively referred to as the Pale Maidens, as their training grounds. The three Hives were ruined a thousand years ago by a freak polar cyclone colloquially referred to as "The Big One" by the Hivers. Hive Niveous is the capital of the planet, and its spirepeak is formed by the Crimson Consuls' fortress-monastery, the Slaughterhorn. Archaphrael Hive is surrounded by the Dry-blind, a deadly snow-covered landscape which layers the lethal Carcharian surface of bottomless crevasses, fissures and fractures.
Sevara	Sevara is an Imperial Feral World, but ancient legends told by its population claim it was once a teeming Hive World, until it was attacked by mechanical xenos. Its feral population now live a nomadic lifestyle, to avoid the xenos who tore down their hives, as they claim the "skeletal men" still reside in Sevara's deepest jungles and have returned more than once to slay anyone they find.
Brettaria	Brettaria is a world of the Imperium. At some point prior to 241.M41 Brettaria suffered from the presence of a warp-cult. The cultists were known to remove and ingest their dead victims' brains.
Triandr	Triandr is a Feudal World of the Imperium.[1a] One of the worlds visited by the Imperial Fists' strike cruiser Capulus for recruits to replenish their numbers after losses on Nimbosa. The population had been out of contact with the Imperium for generations, to the point where it is considered an ancient myth to most.[1b] The two main powers on the planet are the nation states Caritaigne and Sipang, which are constantly at war with each other. Not since the earliest days of the conflict has the war touched the shores of either nation. Instead the battles play out on the few independent states not yet under the control of one country or the other[1b]. This includes the island nation of Eokaroe, whose people worship the Great Father in the Sky, a variation of the Emperor.[1c]
Yolaeu	Yolaeu is an Imperium world that exports wood from its forests.
Corodon IV	Corodon IV was a world of the galaxy that was subjected to Exterminatus by the Sons of Malice.
Aspiria	Aspiria is an Imperial world, that was once invaded by the Word Bearers. The Living Saint Celestine was among the Imperium's forces defending the world then, alongside the Sisters of Battle. After she learned that Aspiria's Cathedrum Miraculous was under attack, though, she led a strike force of Sisters to aid it. They then fought for three days and effectively ended the invasion, as they tore through most of the Word Bearers' forces who had been intent on stopping them. While their actions brought hope back to the world's surviving population, and became part of Aspiria's folklore for centuries to come, the Living Saint and Battle Sisters were too late to save those within the Cathedrum. Though she knew all those within it were already dead, Celestine needed to see their bodies and found their butchered remains, which the Word Bearers had used to desecrate the Cathedrum. As she looked upon the massacre, which had left thousands dead, Celestine's hatred of the forces of Chaos reached heights, the Living Saint never knew she was capable of possessing. An enraged Celestine then swore to the Emperor, that she would purge every last Heretic from His realm, even if it took her a thousand lifetimes to do so.
Kentaur	Kentaur is a planet of the galaxy. Kentaur was the site of a conflict between a force of Imperial Guard and Orks. In the face of defeat, in order to save his own career, General Aldo Dercius, commander of the Jantine Patricians, left Ibram Gaunt's father and his unit behind to be slaughtered by the invading Orks. Many years later, on Khedd 1173, Ibram avenged his father's death by killing Dercius in an honour duel.
Coriallis IV	Coriallis IV is world that once belonged to the Eldar and still contains a Webway Portal on its surface. A Swordwind Host of the Craftworld Biel-tan later used the portal, as they launched an invasion to reclaim Coriallis IV for the Eldar.
Quisto'rol	Quisto'rol is an Imperial world, whose Astra Militarum Regiments took part in the Indomitus Crusade. The stated location of the planet relative to the galaxy map and the Great Rift is mentioned in Codex: Death Guard (8th Edition), pgs. 18-19 (map)
Ko'an Prime	Ko'an Prime is a current war zone for the T'au Empire.
Dranno IV	Dranno IV is a high gravity Imperial world, that is populated by Ogryns.
Minervan Tank Legions	Minervan Tank Legions are Imperial Guard Regiments from Minerva. They specialise in armoured vehicles, and are in fact regarded as a model for other Imperial Guard Armoured Regiments to follow. Minervan Tank Legions are mixed regiments, including men and women in roughly equal numbers. They also include a higher than average number of officers, with most of the Legion's armoured vehicles being commanded by a Lieutenant. Minerva has the industrial capacity to raise an entire Tank Legion every four years.
Lethe Eleven	Lethe Eleven is a former Imperial Hive World that was captured by Orks during the Green Kroosade. As a Hive World, Lethe Eleven was densely populated before it was captured by Orks. It's main industries were metalwork and shield technologies. During the Imperial month of Umbris the planet's largest moon, Kux, lines up exactly with the system's star, plunging Lethe Eleven into a two week eclipse known as the Darknight. This period was a seasonal holiday when the planet was held by the Imperium.[1a] During the Darknight of 338.M41 Inquisitor Gregor Eisenhorn tracked the notorious xenophile Beldame Sadia to Lethe Eleven. The Beldame was killed by Witchfinder Tantalid in catacombs beneath the derelict church of Saint Kiodrus. Tantalid then threatened to execute Eisenhorn for heresy, but was driven off by the Inquisitor's gun-cutter piloted by Medea Betancore.[1a][1b]
Fervious	Fervious is a Feudal World in the Calixis Sector. It is known for its many death cults,[2a] and by some accounts is largely governed by them.[3a] A truly marginalised world accessed only by turbulent warp routes, Fervious has long suffered in its isolation from the wider sector. Once a developed civilisation with a sizable population, the centuries have seen the world rapidly decay and turn inward, and now the bulk of what remains of its people live out a barbaric existence in one vast sprawling shanty city amid the ruins of better days. Fervious’s regression has spawned a very violent culture where life is cheap, brutality commonplace and death cults and doomsday prophets are rife.[2a] Fervious used to be known as Vasenrule, and some people still use the old name to refer to the planet.
Ironghast Foundry	The Ironghast Foundry is a Chaos-held Forge World that is dedicated to the glory of the Blood God. A conclave of Warpsmiths rule over the Ironghast Foundry, led by a cruel and violent slave-driver known only as the Overseer. It is their oath that, while a single soul remains to man the machineries of their global factory, it will never cease churning out weapons for the Blood God's innumerable wars. The Overseer and the conclave maintain bloody pacts with numerous Khorne Warbands for supplies and in return the Warpsmiths demand raw materials, junked war engines, precious metals, and corpses harvested from the fields of war.
Death Korps of Krieg	In life, war. In death, peace. In life, shame. In death, atonement. The Death Korps of Krieg are Imperial Guard Regiments raised from the world of Krieg. Notoriously grim and fatalistic warriors, they seek to atone for their planet's past rebellion by dying glorious deaths in service to the Imperium. For this purpose, Death Korps regiments routinely request to fight in the galaxy's deadliest warzones, grinding their enemy down through long battles of attrition and siege warfare.[1a] Krieg was previously a prosperous Hive World of billions located in Segmentum Tempestus, specialising in manufacture and trade and led by a council of Autocrats. However, as time passed, the debauched and decadent Autocrats increasingly became paranoid that an outside threat would take their power away from them, and thus began to fortify their world from outside threats. Eventually, the Autocrats also began to resent the influence of the Administratum on a planet which they considered to be their own. Finally, in 433.M40, the High Autocrat declared himself independent from the Imperium and renounced the Emperor as his divine master. Civil war broke out on Krieg and much of the planet quickly fell to the rebels, except for Hive Ferrograd, which was under the command of the now-infamous Colonel Jurten of the Krieg 83rd Imperial Guard regiment. Under strict orders to not let Krieg fall, but with the knowledge that no fleet on the scale needed to relieve them was available, Jurten decided that Krieg would either belong to the Emperor or to no one.[2a]
Mannia-4	Mannia-4 was the site of an archaeological expedition, by the galactic explorer Elise Lor.
Davin	Davin was the prime world of the solar system of the same name, conquered during the Great Crusade by Warmaster Horus and the 63rd Expeditionary Fleet. It was the eighth world conquered by the fleet, and so for a time had the designation Sixty-Three Eight. It is principally known for being the world on which Horus made his pact with the Chaos powers. This event took place in the Temple of the Serpent Lodge, where he was treated for injuries incurred while quashing a rebellious force on Davin's moon. Davin's known history only covers the brief time of (supposed) planetary compliance to Imperial rule. The indigenous warriors briefly attempted to resist Imperial takeover, but quickly surrendered, completely outclassed in military terms. The warrior tribespeople were allowed to remain mostly intact after they surrendered to the Imperial forces, as they had impressed Horus with their battlefield courage and their willingness to learn and adapt to a new way of life. The actual military campaign on Davin was short, and the Luna Wolves left soon after the surrender of the Davinite warriors, taking with them their concept of the warrior-lodge. The re-education and shepherding of the people into the light of the Imperial Truth was left to a detachment of the Word Bearers Legion led by Kor Phaeron[1a], while governorship of the planet itself was given to Commander Eugen Temba.[1b]
Goru-Prime	Goru-Prime is an Imperial Desert World known for its close ties with Tallarn. Every ten years it provides the Tallarn Desert Raiders and other desert worlds of Imperium with Mukaali - indigenous beasts that live in the equatorial deserts of this planet.
Champions of Fenris	The Champions of Fenris is one of the twelve active Great Companies of the Space Wolves, falling under the direct control of Great Wolf Logan Grimnar himself. It is the largest of the Great Companies. The Champions of Fenris are fanatically loyal to their leader, Logan Grimnar. Each warrior is extremely proud of his link to the supreme lord of the Chapter, and constantly vies with his peers for their masters favour. Logan Grimnar firmly believes that a battle can be carried by a few heroes in the right place at the right time, and as such makes effective use of the many Wolf Guard and Venerable Dreadnoughts in his Great Company. It also maintains a large complement of Wolf Priests, Rune Priests, and Iron Priests that are loaned to other Great Companies when needed. The company's emblem seem to vary between both a moon behind a wolf's head and The Wolf that walks the stars, a wolf standing on its hind legs on a dark background with stars. This happens in both older and more recent sources.
Husk	Husk is an Imperial Hive World. Ten thousand years of industrialization has left Husk's surface cold, poisoned, withered and barren. The Hive Varpitt exists there amidst a desert and contains a population of hundreds of millions, as well as the Museum of Chalcedony Angels. Since Husk's gravity is less than half of the Imperium's standard, however, any dust that gets kicked up will remain in its air for quite a while. If enough does so, it could form a vast dust cloud filled with heavy metals and rad particles. When this occurs, the dust wreaks havoc with long-range vox transmissions, auspex sensors and targeting systems. Even the systems of Space Marine warships are not immune to this. The Dark Angels Chapter's 5th Company discovered this, after they came to Husk's aid when it was invaded by Orks in M42. Master Lazarus hoped to get around this, though, by drawing the Xenos to his position in numbers so large, that the Battle Barge Unrelenting Fury could see them. The Fury was then meant to destroy the Orks with an orbital bombardment and put an end to the invasion before they reached the Company. However, just as the Xenos neared the 5th, the Battle Barge's commander, Domitius, received an urgent message from the Dark Angels' Supreme Grand Master Azrael. It contained orders of the highest priority for the Unrelenting Fury, which required that the Battle Barge leave at once to fulfil them. Domitius immediately began preparations to do so, but informed Master Lazarus of his new orders before the Fury departed from Husk. This meant, though, that the 5th would now likely suffer heavy losses at the charging Orks' hands.
Mysibis	Mysibis is a world of the Imperium. The White Scars 3rd Company successfully defended the planet from a Tyranid invasion. During the invasion, Master of the Hunt Kor'sarro personally slew a Hive Tyrant in one-on-one combat.
Beroghast	Beroghast is an Ice World of the Imperium. Its population is similar to Feral World level and is highly primitive, but nonetheless a number of factory complexes operate on the planet. In 963.M41, the planet was invaded by Waaagh! Snappaklaw, resulting in the Assault on Beroghast.
Athanos	Athanos is an Imperial world
Solemnus	Solemnus is a former Adeptus Astartes Homeworld of the Black Templars. Solemnus is believed to have been first settled by mankind during the millennia-distant Dark Age of Technology[2a]. A thousand years before the Black Templars, under Marshal Emrik, came to Solemnus to quash an insidious genestealer cult that had held almost the entire planet in its filthy talons. After cleansing the planet of the genestealer taint, the Black Templars claimed Solemnus and used it as a recruiting world[2b]. The chapter maintained a monastery-fortress on the planet, which they used to resupply and gather suitable recruits for their chapter between crusades; consisting of a permanent population of a hundred battle-brothers, as well as the neophytes, serfs, adepts and many other minions who saw to the needs of the Black Templars and the fortress itself.[1a] A world troubled by storms, its populace sustained themselves by sheep-farming, forestry, the raising of livestock, basic mining and quarrying. Those same people maintained their own method of government via a system of petty kingdoms and vassal lords. But it was the castellan of the monastery-fortress who was the true overlord, and effectively governor, of the planet, who represented Solemnus to the greater Imperium.[2b]
Shardenus	Shardenus is a Hive World in the Contqual Subsector, which was the site of a pivotal battle between the Iron Hands Space Marine Chapter and the forces of Chaos in 812.M41.[1b] The citizens of Contqual lived a decadent and carefree existence, believing they had created a paradise free from the ugliness found throughout the rest of the Imperium. As a result of this decadence, in late 812.M41, the High Governor of the subsector succumbed to the influence of the Chaos God Slaanesh. Within a month, the entire subsector was tainted by Chaos, and the worst effects of this taint were on Shardenus, where a Warp rift had opened, disgorging hordes of Daemons into the Materium, where they were embraced and worshipped by the native inhabitants.[1a] The Imperium's vengeance came in the forms of the Iron Hands, who hated Chaos and its influences more than any other Space Marine chapter. The Iron Hands reclaimed a dozen worlds in the subsector, purging the tainted populations without mercy. The most desperate battle was on Shardenus, where the Iron Hands fought directly against the daemonic hordes, and the warp rift was sealed by the combined efforts of the chapter Librarians.[1a]
Samax IV	Samax IV (also known as Agra "The Emperor's Garden") is a pre-industrial human world. It has a single continent with 1.75% of Terra's landmass, with a high soil yield, but is low in exploitable minerals. When the world was invaded by Orks, the population fled to the walled city of Mallax. The world was saved by the timely arrival of the Imperial Hawks Space Marine Chapter.
Ionus X	Ionus X is an Imperium Forge World.
Plague Planet	Munificence[8a] (or the Plague Planet to outside observers) is the Daemon World of the Daemon Prince Mortarion, and homeworld of the Death Guard Traitor Legion. Originally an Eldar world known as Eliathada (meaning sublime soul garden, prideful wasteland, or dry valley of dreams), the world was scoured of life in the Fall of the Eldar and became located deep inside the Eye of Terror. Eliathada was claimed by the Daemon Primarch Mortarion following the Horus Heresy. Becoming the new home of the Death Guard, Mortarion has made the world into a world of poison, horror, and misery swathed in a miasma of disease-filled clouds. It is unknown who renamed Eliathada the Plague Planet, though the origin is likely from the Thousand Sons. To the Death Guard themselves however, the world is known as Munifience.[8a] The rotting hull of spacecraft which succumb to plague are eventually drawn, sometimes over thousands of years, to the Plague Planet, where they become part of the Plague Fleets. These fleets carry followers of Nurgle through the warp to inhabited worlds where their destructive raids are inevitably followed by outbreaks of deathly contagion. Plague Ships that are abandoned or have their crews destroyed drift back to the Plague Planet once more.
Ingiga	Ingiga is the homeworld of the Angels of Fury Space Marine Chapter.
Ixus IX	Ixus IV is a former Imperial penal world, first being overrun by Necrons and then invaded by the Bloodlords Warband. Ixus IV was a Tomb World dedicated to an unknown Necron Dynasty before it was turned into Penal World by the Imperium. Shortly before the arrival of the chaos warband, the Necrons awoke, purged it of all life, and remained dormant until the Bloodlords arrived. Led by Chaos Lord Sabaktes Chaos Warband, the Bloodlords invade a penal moon looking for the blood of murderers to satisfy the Lord of Skulls. After a few skirmishes and having their light destroyer Bloodhammer shot down from orbit, they discover Necrons have purged the moon of all life. Lord of Skulls then destroys the Necrons and at least part of the Bloodlords to satisfy its bloodlust.
Six Hour Revolution	The Cassell Rebellion, also known as the Six Hour Revolution for its fleetingness, took place on the agri-world of Cassell in 776.M36. At that time Cassell was ruled by an Imperial cult called the Way of the Emperor's Flesh. The planetary governor, Supreme Pontiff Skalin, was known for having eccentric views but was otherwise regarded as loyal and reliable. However, rumours began to circulate of Skalin's belief that his cult was the one true cult of the Emperor and the rest of the Imperium should be made to acknowledge that fact. The 16th Armageddon Steel Legion had been stationed on Cassell following exemplary service in the Lotharn Campaign under the command of General Belov's Third Army. Colonel Kleist became aware of the rumours about the Pontiff and petitioned the Administratum for permission to investigate him. Before the colonel had heard word back however, High Pontiff Skalin renounced the High Lords of Terra and called on all Cassellians to join a crusade to bring the Way of the Emperor's Flesh to the entire Imperium.
Susa	Susa is a planet known for its acid storms.
Salem	Salem was an asteroid-monastery of the Imperium. In 156991.M41, the monastery there came under assault from Hive Fleet Kraken. The Adeptus Ministorum monks chose to poison themselves and their ecosystem with a necrotising rotweed rather than allow themselves to be consumed by the Tyranids.
Gethseda	Gethseda is an Imperium world that was invaded by Tyranids. The Sisters of Battle from the Order of the Ebon Chalice came to Gethseda's aid, though it is not known if they were able to save the world.
Samson IV	Samson IV is a Hive World in the Calixis Sector.
Liar's Due (Short Story)	"Liar's Due" is a short story by James Swallow in the Horus Heresy series. News has reached Town Forty-Four, on the tranquil world of Virger-Mos II: Terra has fallen, the Emperor is dead and the Imperium belongs to Horus Lupercal. As the people of Forty-Four struggle to deal with this revelation and the rest of the planet falls into anarchy, Leon Kyyter begins to doubt the news, along with the stranger from Terra, the remembrancer with the odd tattoo... The people of Town 44 on the remote Imperial backwater world Virger-Mos II are thrown into doubt and confusion when it is announced that Horus has slain the Emperor and now rules the galaxy. Mechanic Silas Cincade volunteers to travel to the capital to find out the truth,[2a] and meanwhile the people begin carrying weapons and having arguments over the best course of action. Lights in the sky appear to herald the arrival of Astartes, and reports start to come through of armoured figures wiping out towns. Solar farmer Dallon Prael announces his intention to die rather than surrender to Horus's forces and mistakenly shoots dead Silas Cincade as he returns from the capital.[2c] As the town falls into violence and anarchy a boy named Leon Kyyter discovers his father's lodger, a remembrancer named Mendacs who arrived eight weeks earlier[2b] and formed something of a friendship with the boy[2d], sneaking out of the house and follows him to the town's skyhook. Mendacs forces the skyhook's lone astropath to send a message before executing her, and reveals to Leon that he is an Alpha Legion agent tasked with spreading false tidings of Horus's victory who has orchestrated events to make Virger-Mos II fall to the Warmaster without even being invaded. Mendacs departs for his next mission, and unable to stop him Leon watches silently as his planet burns.[2e]
Chandrax II	Chandrax II is a former world of the Imperium, now a Necron Tomb World. The Cadian 87th regiment was sent to assault Traitor Guardsmen on the planet, when an errant Quake Shell, fired by a Banesword, narrowly missed the top of a fortress wall and landed in the distance of the battlefield. The sudden vibrations disturbed a dormant Necron Monolith and the ensuing, implacable wave of awoken Necron Warriors destroyed the regiment.
X'irtam	X'irtam is an Industrial World that, sometime after the Great Rift's creation, became the site of a battle between the Iron Hands and the Tau Empire.
Sautekh Dynasty	The Sautekh Dynasty is one of the most powerful Necron Dynasties which is currently ruled over by Phaeron Imotekh the Stormlord. Consisting of eighty Tomb Worlds, its crownworld is Mandragora on the Eastern Fringe.[1c] In the times before the biotransference that transformed the Necrontyr into the Necrons, the Sautekh Dynasty was ranked third most powerful of all the dynasties. Through chance or design, many of the core Sautekh Tomb Worlds survived the Great Sleep. However, chaos ruled its Crownworld of Mandragora and its slumbering Phaeron had succumbed to the ravages of the eons. Members of his royal court engaged in a civil war for the throne, and one of the pretenders awoke the renowned Nemesor Imotekh in search of victory. However, instead of winning the throne for him, Imotekh promptly took control of the Sautekh Dynasty for itself and set it on a path of galactic conquest.[9c] Today the Sautekh Dynasty is among the most powerful and is quickly becoming a major threat on the Imperium's Eastern Borders.[1a] To the Imperium, the dynasty has become synonymous with the Necrons, and it is erroneously believed by many that they represent the alien race as a whole, with all other dynasties being mere offshoots of the Sautekh.
Horizon	Horizon is a Frontier World in the Calixis Sector.
Golgenna Reach	The Golgenna Reach is a sub-sector of the Calixis Sector. It is at the centre of the sector and contains the sector capital Scintilla.
Vidar Sector	The Vidar Sector is an Imperial Sector located in the Eastern Fringe. It is under constant siege by both the xenos and the daemon. The Sector is ruled over by several powerful families that while Imperial is name, are largely self-serving. Four hundred years before 645.M39, one of these families, the Calcearius Clan of the Darkfall System, saw their power uprooted in an invasion by the Tzeentchian warrior known only as the Herald of Fate. The Calcearius Clan's survivors, led by Februss Calcearius, fled for their lives to the Hive World of Praedis Zeta.
Guer III	Guer III is a world of the Imperium. Though it is considered a backwater world that lies far from the light of Terra, Guer III is heavily fortified due to being the target of many Xeno attacks. Its many fortifications (one of which is maintained by the Dark Angels Chapter) have ensured Guer III has never fallen to an attack. The last defence line of the planet includes the mighty Plasma Obliterator system, named Furious Blade, which in the time of great suffering rouse the war spirit of the planet's inhabitants.
Eternal War (Comic Anthology)	Eternal War is an anthology of 7 comics edited by Marc Gascoigne and Andy Jones published in 2001, with cover art by Paul Dainton. Its contents were republished in Flames of Damnation (Comic Anthology) alongside other stories and comics.
Espandor	Espandor is a Cardinal World of the Imperium of Man. It is part of the realm of Ultramar and so falls under the control of the Ultramarines. A heavily forested world, its major cities are confined to the westernmost of its two continents, with remote agri-complexes scattered about its surface. It is one of the more distant worlds from Macragge and the least-densely populated. According to legend, the original settlers of Espandor were the descendants of explorers from Macragge during the Age of Strife, their vessels blown off-course and left stranded on the planet by a Warp Storm. With the organization of Ultramar and the start of the Great Crusade, Espandor would become one of many worlds to supply raw resources and recruits to the creation and upkeep of the Ultramarines Legion.[Needs Citation]
Macragge	This article contains text passages or images with citation issues. The concerned content is marked with "Citation issue" tags. Please help to improve this article by fixing those issues as described in the corresponding Help article. Do also note that it is absolutely forbidden to add new information or content to these marked passages as long as the pre-existing citation issues have not been completely resolved. Macragge is the homeworld of the Ultramarines Chapter of the Space Marines and the capital world of the stellar realm of Ultramar. It is unique among all the worlds of the Imperium in that, apart from Terra and Mars themselves, it is the only planet allowed dominion over other planets — in its case, the other worlds of Ultramar.
Scythia	Scythia was a Necron Tomb World, that was one of the many worlds in the Vorsk Sub-Sector that fell to Waaagh! Gragnatz in M41. Afterwards the Tomb World had its teleport nodes salvaged by the Waaagh!.
Rynn's World	Rynn's World is a world of the Imperium. Most notably it is the base and homeworld to the Crimson Fists Space Marines chapter. Rynn's World is located in the Loki Sector of the galaxy, galactically southeast of Terra. Described as a beautiful and peaceful world, the planet is sparsely populated, mountainous, and devoted to intensive agriculture. Due to its distance from other Imperial worlds and its proximity to the Ork Empire of Charadon, it is somewhat isolated from the rest of the Imperium, the closest neighbouring human planet being Badlanding. Though serving as the chapter's base, the world is not owned by the Crimson Fists, and has its own Planetary Governor. Before the devastating Invasion of Rynn's World, the planet was protected by a formidable missile defence system, designed to deter invaders.[Help] The serene nature of Rynn's World has made it unsuitable for recruitment or training, with the Crimson Fists preferring instead Blackwater.
Skarus	Skarus is a Necron Tomb World. On this planet the Ulthwé Farseer Eldrad Ulthran finally discovered an ancient artefact he had spent many years searching for. The Farseer believed that with the proper rituals, the artefact could permanently close every Warp Rift, and in doing so prevent Humans and other primitive races from using Warp travel, rendering them helpless before the Eldar. However, word of Eldrad's plans spread and soon the Imperium, as well as various Xenos and Chaos groups, descended upon Skarus to stop the Farseer from succeeding.
Priory II	Priory II is an Imperial world that has been invaded by Orks, though the Great Wolf Logan Grimnar has now led the Space Wolves to the world's aid.
Mornax	"A small, grim, mining world known for its hellish conditions, which produce a famously hardy and dour populace."[1a] Miners on this world are wary of marauding Ambulls.[1b] The world was vassalized in M36[2c] and granted status as part of the Moebian Domain in M38.[2d]
Goborra	Goborra is an Imperial Mining World that is affiliated with Mars and during the Psychic Awakening, it was one of the worlds visited by Magos Dominus Xu Kroll's Reclamation Fleet. At that time, data-Daemons had infected the world's servitor clades, which turned them into abominations that tore apart their masters.
Traekonnis Major	Traekonnis Major is the Homeworld of the Avenging Sons Space Marine Chapter.
Darkenhel	Darkenhel is a planet of the Imperium. Darkenhel is a world that was an enclave to anti-Imperial renegades, until they were destroyed in an attack by the Dark Angels' Deathwing Company in M41. Over two dozen Fallen Angels were seized in the attack and for many months, their agonised' screams rang the cells of The Rock.
Epihelikon	Epihelikon is a Jungle World that lies within the Chondax System, which was part of the Ork Warlord Urlakk Urg's empire during the Great Crusade.[1a] However, after Urlakk was killed during the Imperium's successful invasion of Ullanor, the Chondax System was all that remained of the Warlord's former empire.[1a] This soon came to an end though, when the Primarch Jaghatai Khan led his White Scars Legion in a campaign that cleansed the Chondax System of its Ork infestation.[1b]
Warzone Epsilon	Warzone Epsilon (originally known as Helena II) is a War World and Agri-World of the Severan Dominate, located in the Periphery Sub-Sector of the Calixis Sector. Originally named Helena II, Warzone Epsilon was a moderately colonised world in the Periphery Sub-Sector. Initially discovered by Saint Drusus during the Angevin Crusade, it remained largely forgotten for several centuries. During a period of Calixis expansionism in late M40, Helena II was colonised at the same time as several other highly regarded worlds within the Periphery. Administratum projections gave the colonisation effort a high probability of success due to its amenable agricultural conditions. Consequently, the Administratum sent a large initial wave of colonists. Additional supplies and the protection offered by a small Imperial Navy presence enabled the colonists to transform Helena II into a thriving agri-world in a remarkably short period of time. Over the course of just a few centuries, the planet’s harvests began to provide adequate supplies for several of the Periphery’s worlds. Some even dared to hope that it could eventually become a breadbasket for the Periphery, while still providing much needed foodstuffs to the greater Calixis Sector. Additional assets were accorded the world, including the manpower to revitalise the Lycurgos star fort that had been abandoned in the system during the Angevin Crusade. With the star fort’s refit complete, Helena II was regarded as one of the most productive and best defended worlds within the sub-sector. Even the most aggressive xenos forces in the region recognised the star fort’s might and chose to target worlds less well defended.
Unloth	Unloth is the Feral World where the Lunar Class Cruiser Lord Daros was constructed. There, the Governor influenced the local tribes to mine and smelt metals to be "sacrificed" at "sky temples". Over the course of eleven years, enough raw material was collected in this way to complete construction of the Lord Daros, at which point the tribes were treated to the sight of a new star moving across the sky as the ship ignited its plasma drives and flew out of the system to join Battlefleet Obscurus.
Fydae System	The Fydae System is a planetary system that lies on the rimward side of the Malfian Subsector in the Calixis Sector.[1a] It is as yet unknown what connection (if any) this system has with the Fydae Great Cloud which lies Trailing of the Calixis Sector.[1b] Imperial Guard Regiments supplement the habitable worlds' PDFs against the pirate clans that have plagued the system for the last 200 years. The system possesses at least three planets - Fydae Minos, Junos and Kessae.[1a]

Uldan	Uldan is a Mining World of the Imperium. The rich ore deposits in the Hellfire Canyon have made Uldan a hotly disputed planet. Every known power in the galaxy has made an attempt to wrest this world from the grip of the Imperium, with the exception of the Tyranids , but many feel it is only a matter of time before that changes.
Scoria Prime	Scoria Prime is an Imperium world that lies near the Damocles Gulf. In the aftermath of Cadia's destruction during the Thirteenth Black Crusade, the world was invaded by Daemons.

Cthonia	Cthonia was the world on which Horus landed after being stolen from the grip of the Emperor. A den of hive-sprawls and polluted industry, Cthonia existed in one of Earth's closest neighbouring systems. Being within reach even for non-warp spacecraft, Cthonia had been colonised, built upon, tunnelled and mined probably since the dawn of space travel. As such, all natural resources had been stripped away and used up millennia before, and the ancient mining technology had long since been rediscovered and removed by the Adeptus Mechanicus of Mars. The planet that remained was largely redundant and abandoned, described as rocky and volcanic,[5b] completely riddled with catacombs, crumbling industrial plants and exhausted mine-workings. The planet was notorious for the vicious gangs and slums. Most of its population fought and died with each other in the labyrinthine tunnels below the Mechanicum-ruled surface. At the planet's heart was a massive volcanic cavern that the gangs used to incinerate their dead. The first Imperial contact with Cthonia took place in the early Great Crusade, when a Star Hunters pioneer company under Captain Kornelius Dure discovered the world and declared it a "nest of serpents coiling in the dark that we would be better to destroy". However, the planet was revealed as the homeworld of Horus, one of the Emperor's lost Primarch's and the first to be rediscovered. Upon incorporation into the Imperium, the Space Marines of the Luna Wolves Legion were created using the human inhabitants of the violent gangs inhabiting the planet's hives. Inhabitants of Cthonia had slightly freckled faces and pale, craggy features.[5a]
Haark	Haark is a world of the Imperium. The Haark system was attacked in 477.M39 by the Daemons of Tzeentch.

Caligari Sector	The Caligari Sector is a vast and ancient Sector of the Imperium that is located in the Segmentum Tempestus. It is far from the guiding light of the Astronomican and riven by foul tempests known as Warpsurges. These surges are relatively small yet frequently appearing Warp Storms unique to the Caligari Sector. Warpsurges can twist reality and cut off entire systems for centuries, leaving them ripe for Chaos infestation and Xenos invaders. The prevalence of this phenomena led to Rogue Traders nicknaming the Sector as "The Beast with a Thousand Eyes". While there are areas of the Caligari Sector which are more prone to the manifestation of Warpsurges, there are also areas within the sector which have remained safe from the surges. These safer regions of the Caligari Sector became the local hubs of Imperial presence over the millennia. Worlds left unattended for centuries due to Warpsurges are prone to Chaos infestation and heresy. The Inquisitors of the Caligari Conclave are charged with the safety of the Sector. The sector was once ruled by an enigmatic Xenos species known as the Fabricatus. Their homeworld - FLZ-672 - is a dry and barren planet, located in the Ventus System within the Atroxia Subsector. Long ago, this race wrote the Visceram Prophecy about the Alpha Pariah and its role, although they didn't know anything about what kind would represent this being and how it would be created. Soon after the Fabricatus vanished. According to the Adeptus Mechanicus this race never left Caligari and they existed during Ancient History, when humans made their very first steps at Holy Terra.
Kai	Kai was a planetary system and Forge World close to the Eye of Terror until it was absorbed into the Eye by the Warp Storm Gae-sann in M34.

As the Orks were salvaging from Verdfall's ruins, the world was invaded by the Crimson Slaughter Warband, who thought it may contain the Hellfire Stone Chaos Artefact they had been searching for. In the battle that followed, the Crimson Slaughter made short work of the Orks and soon left when they determined that the Hellfire Stone was not located on Verdfall, leaving the world in ruins and strewn with corpses.
Zantium	Zantium was the site of a hard fought battle between the Geno Five-Two Chiliad Imperial Army Regiment and Dragonoid cadres during the Great Crusade.

Parabulus	Parabulus is used as a base by pirates. In M41, the Black Templars and Dark Angels targeted Parabulus and fought alongside each other in an attempt to weaken the pirates who used it as a base. However, a dispute over a prisoner the Black Templars captured caused both Chapters to briefly fight one another. The incident was later reported, and an Inquisitorial inquiry was commenced.
Ghola's Hope	Ghola's Hope is an Imperial Shrine World, that was attacked by the Tau Empire in 995.M41, though, the final outcome of the battle is not known.
Kaurava III	Kaurava III is the third and least developed planet of the Kaurava system. Dangerous predators such as Arkenbeasts and Sandworms roam its barren surface, many of which are entirely capable of crushing entire villages flat. Due to its inhospitable nature, Kaurava III was of little use to the Imperium beside the mining industry there. The planet's single moon was accidentally destroyed by an attempt to bring mining to it, the subsequent explosion resulting in a ring of dust and ice that now encircles Kaurava III. The rest descended upon Kaurava III's surface, resulting in untold death and destruction.
New Badab	New Badab is a planet in the Maelstrom which became the base of the Red Corsairs after the destruction of their former homeworld, Badab. The world was originally inhabited by hundreds of thousands of Mutants and other foul Humans, but Huron and his surviving 300 Astral Claws made short work of them and quickly took over the world. New Badab is the location of the Palace of Thorns, a huge fortress dubbed surrounded by a frightful battery of guns, which is the residence of the Blood Reaver, Huron Blackheart. With hundreds of ships defending its orbit, is visited by many alien species, such as the loxatl or the warriors of the Lost and the Damned. It also plays host to the Skull Harvest, a tournament in which leaders battle it out to swell their forces. Warsmith Honsou once visited the planet to increase his forces, in preparation for his invasion of Ultramar.
Hannizare	Hannizare was the site of a battle for the Imperial Fists and Iron Hands Legions during the Great Crusade and its aftermath, for reasons unknown, led to a brief schism between the Primarchs Rogal Dorn and Ferrus Manus.
Boucherin	Boucherin is an Imperial Hive World.
Occludus	Occludus is the homeworld of the Death Spectres Space Marine Chapter. It is located to the far northeast of Ultima Segmentum, overlooking the Ghoul Stars. After the Scouring of the Nostramo Sector, Occludus was established as a deep monitoring station on the edge of the Ghoul Stars. In 063.M31, it was under the command of Crysos Morturg, Captain of the 108th Independent Company and a former member of the Death Guard. It became the homeworld of the Death Spectres Chapter as part of the "Dark" Thirteenth Founding in late M35/early M36. The first Chapter Master, Corcaedus, came to Occludus following a vision from the Emperor, discovering the xenos artefact called the Shariax in a secret cavern beneath the planet's surface.[4b] Today it is home to the Chapter's Fortress-Monastery, the Logopol and its surface is filled with many graveyards.[4a]
The Lightning Tower (Short Story)	"The Lightning Tower" is a short story by Dan Abnett, published in the Horus Heresy Chapbook (Anthology) in 2007, and in Shadows of Treachery (Anthology) in 2012. Rogal Dorn, Primarch of the Imperial Fists Legion, faces a stark reality - he must tear down the magnificence of the Emperor's Palace, a shining beacon in a galaxy of darkness, and turn it into a fortress. With the army of Horus drawing ever closer, as he blights the Palace with gunports and defence towers, Dorn must face a difficult question: "What are you afraid of?" Primarch Rogal Dorn laments the transformation of the Imperial Palace, a wonder of architecture meant to celebrate the Emperor of Mankind's ascent, into a fortress meant to resist the onslaught of traitor legions. He must concur with Vadok Singh's project for the Annapurna Gate, but insists its ornaments be preserved for future restoration.[2a] Archamus I encourages his primarch to voice his frustration, and asks him whom he is afraid of.[2b]
Halo Zone	The Halo Zone is the name of the region of Segmentum Pacificus beyond the light of the Astronomican where Imperial Navigators guiding ships during Warp jumps are no longer able to sense its guiding light and are thereby forced to navigate blindly. Doing so in the Warp is extremely hazardous and most, if not all, Navigators will refuse to go beyond the borders of the Astronomican for this reason. Also, due to the difficulties in navigation, the time taken to cross a region is increased while also increasing the time differential between realspace and the Warp. Lord Commander Solar Macharius attempted to continue his crusade into the Halo Zone, but his troops refused to go on into the unknown, possibly because they believed they would no longer be under the protection of the Emperor.

Burjan's World	Burjan's World is a Fortress World of the Iron Warriors which is ruled over by the Chaos Lord Chengrel. Chengrel was able to establish his hold on the planet without Imperial reprisal thanks to the anarchy and instability within the Mitre Gulf. However, the planet has suffered invasions from three Waaagh!s led by the Ork Warboss Ungskar.
Coellow Quintus	Coellow Quintus is an Imperium world.
Merga	Marfak is a Jungle World. In their pursuit of the Word Bearers Chaos Lord Zymran, Captain Kruger's Ultramarines Company raided Merga for supplies.
Medusa (Planet)	Medusa IV[5b], commonly referred to as Medusa, is the Homeworld of the Iron Hands Space Marine Chapter. Medusa is a Waste World, that is a harsh realm of perpetual gloom, located extremely close to the Eye of Terror. With a dark and polluted sky, Medusa's sun rarely shines on the planet's surface and the world's geology is highly unstable, with earthquakes, electrical storms, and volcanic eruptions constantly creating and destroying mountain ranges and seas. The people of Medusa are hardy and flourish despite the hostile environment. The population is broken up into clans who viciously compete and vie for natural resources and safe ground, as the unpredictable nature of Medusa's landscape means little can built in one place for long, save a few areas of relative calm which are mostly reserved for the Iron Hands Chapter. As the nomadic clans seek a new settlement, great caterpillar-like mining haulers carry their personal possessions and resources. It is because of its harsh environment that Medusa is considered to be a Death World, in all but name.
Aumet	Aumet is an Imperial world in Segmentum Obscurus known to raise regiments for the Astra Militarum. In late M41, the planet was ruled by High Lord Gheret Rogge. He was petitioned for military forces by Commissar Sebastian Yarrick (who was attempting to track down and kill the Ork Warlord Ghazghkull Thraka for his earlier invasion of Armageddon). Rogge agreed to contribute the Aumet 23rd Armoured regiment to Yarrick's cause; the regiment was led by Gheret's sixth son, Colonel Kelner Rogge.
Greiman's World	Greiman's World was the site of a victorious battle for the Dark Angels Legion during the Great Crusade.
Bucharis	Cardinal Bucharis was a member of the Ecclesiarchy during the time of the Age of Apostasy. He was stationed on a planet named Gathalamor, preaching in the name of the Emperor. When warp storms covered a large swathe of the south western region of the galaxy, Bucharis saw it fit to carve himself a vast empire from the Imperium, beginning the Plague of Unbelief. He accomplished this by preaching that Terra had fallen, and that Gathalamor was now the centre of religion. With his two compatriots, Admiral Sehalla and Colonel Gasto, he conquered his empire in a relatively short period. It was only until he met the Space Wolves did things turn for the worse. He poured millions of men into the conquest of Fenris, the Space Wolves homeworld, but The Fang turned out to be an impossible dream to conquer. He was finally driven back when a Space Wolf fleet arrived in orbit and drove off Bucharis' supporting ships.
Imon	Imon is an Imperium World that was invaded by Orks during the Pyrus Reach Conflict. It was later saved by a task force composed of the Dark Angels Chapter and the Cadian Imperial Guard.
Hethgar Prime	Hethgar Prime is an Imperial planet.[1a] The planet was attacked by Orks and defended by the Blood Angels force of Captain Dracomedes.[1a] The major city of the planet, Hejopolis, was turned to ruins by Orks.[1c] Hethgar Prime has several moons.[1b]
Beta-Garmon Star Cluster	The Beta-Garmon Star Cluster is a strategically vital region of Segmentum Solar. The Beta-Garmon Cluster was first settled during the Dark Age of Technology and was one of the few regions of human space to largely endure the Age of Strife intact, making it vital in the early days of the Great Crusade when it peacefully merged with the fledgling Imperium.[6b] Beta-Garmon is also the home to stable Warp routes that allow for entry into the Sol System. These factors make the region extremely important from a strategic standpoint. Beta-Garmon served as the mustering point for the Imperial retribution force before it struck Prospero. Due to the Ruinstorm at the onset of the Horus Heresy, the Cluster was largely cutoff from the wider Imperium and schisms between loyalist and traitor factions began thanks to the instigation of the Alpha Legion. After the nearby Paramar System fell into civil war, the Beta-Garmon cluster quickly followed suit.[7a] Later in the Heresy, it was taken by the Emperor's Children only to be retaken by Salamanders, Imperial Army and loyalist Titan Legions in the Battle of Nyrcon. Heavily fortified by Rogal Dorn thereafter, Beta-Garmon became the site of vicious fighting between Imperial and traitor forces due to its strategic importance. The battle was one of the largest of the Heresy, but ultimately it was the forces of the Warmaster that emerged victorious.
Minerva	Minerva is a Civilised World and the homeworld of the Minervan Tank Legions. Minerva was first colonised by the Imperium in M37. Shortly after the planet was invaded by Chaos renegades under the command of the Sorcerer Lord Torvel the Deluded. The invaders were driven off by the massed armoured tanks of the Armageddon 1st Steel Legion Regiment, with Torvel being slain by Commissar Orthos. The 1st Steel Legion were given Right of Conquest over Minerva, with Colonel Mantubb appointed Planetary Governor. Mantubb shaped Minerva into an industrial-based world exporting weapons and armoured vehicles to neighbouring Imperial worlds. Over the millennia Minerva has continued to grow as an industrial centre. It now has seven large, sprawling cities, and the industrial capacity to raise an entire Tank Legion every four years in addition to its other trade commitments. The quality of Minerva's machine shops in second only to those of Armageddon. This has come at the cost of reducing much of the planet's natural environment to ash. Some Imperial scholars predict that within a few thousand years Minerva will become a productive Hive World, perhaps even rivalling Armageddon for strategic importance.
Sternac	Sternac is the homeworld of the Iron Lords Space Marine Chapter.
White Dwarf 362 (UK)	White Dwarf 361 White Dwarf 190 White Dwarf 178 White Dwarf 170 White Dwarf 132 White Dwarf 362 was released in February 2010 and featured some additional new Legion of the Damned miniatures, while the rest were released last month in issue 361.

Lorek	Lorek is an Imperial world, that is covered in snowy forests. Its Astra Militarum Regiments are known for their marksmanship.
Levion Gamma	Levion Gamma is a world of the Imperium. Levion Gamma was invaded by an alliance of Ork Clans, which destroyed everything before them. Eventually, the Orks encircled the citadels called the Five Towers, the last bastion of defense for the Imperium. The Blood Angels First Company led a charge into the massive horde and in the ensuing battle the Orks were defeated. Though the battle was won, Levion Gamma never recovered from the Ork invasion.
Archipelaga	Archipelaga is a Feral Ocean World, the landmass of which is broken up into innumerable islands of varying size.[1a] The planet was a human colony, likely reclaimed by the Imperium during the Great Crusade, and subsequently lost during the Horus Heresy. The planet all but disappeared from Imperial records after the Heresy, but later evidence proved that the inhabitants had turned to worship Chaos and raised several temples to Nurgle.[1e][1f] The Imperium re-discovered the world in the wake of the Damocles Gulf Crusade, and set about reclaiming it.[1a] The campaign to do so was prolonged, but not especially difficult, since the native humans had no high technology (crossbows and gunpowder representing the "state of the art").[1b] The capital city of the world had had a an Imperial starport built, and had "all the comforts of civilisation".[1c]
Moirae Schism	The Moirae Schism was a major event in Adeptus Mechanicus history that took place during the Nova Terra Interregnum in M35. Sparked by a heretical creed generated on the Forge World of Moirae, it was the greatest civil war within the Adeptus Mechanicus since the Schism of Mars during the Horus Heresy. The Moirae Tech-creed was based on the prophetic wave of calculations of a triad of tech-mystics enshrined within the rebellious Forge World of Moirae. The creed maintained that the beacon of the Astronomican contained hidden messages within its micro-fluctuations, and that these messages were from the Omnissiah and prophetic in nature. The Moirae Tech-priests compiled these apocalyptic messages in their archives, copies of which quickly spread through many of the Cult Mechanicus' sub-sects. These radical teachings included references to the future overthrow of Mars and the fusion of the Adeptus Mechanicus and Ecclesiarchy. Such claims were treated as heresy by Mechanicus authorities on Mars, and civil war was quickly sparked between traditionalist and radical elements.[2a] Over two thousand years of bloody strife would pass before the rebels were finally purged by the Imperium. While Moirae itself was swiftly destroyed by a Adeptus Mechanicus Fleet sent from Mars [2a], the schism had already spread throughout the Mechanicus. Several Titan Legions and Space Marine Chapters with close ties to the Mechanicus were also caught up in the insurgency.
Grunald	Grunald is an Agri World of the Imperium. It was among the first group of targets to feel the wrath of the Crimson Slaughter Warband when it first emerged from the Eye of Terror. The Chaos Space Marines destroyed entire communities on Grunald before departing, but their presence was blamed for the wilted and bleeding crops that left one of its continents to starve.
Coronis Agathon	Coronis Agathon is a Hive World of the Imperium. Also classified as a Fortress World, it serves as a garrison for over 10 million soldiers of the Imperial Guard. Agathon survived both the Dark Age of Technology and Age of Strife relatively unscathed. During the Great Crusade, the world was brought into the Imperium by the 60th Expeditionary Fleet and the MaSade Family of Rogue Traders. The powerful Hive World became a major hub in the northern Imperium thereafter, becoming the center of a semi-autonomous entity known as the Agathean Domain which consisted of several planets. Agathon also became well known for its Solar Auxilia Cohorts during this time, known as the Lord Marshal's Own. During the Horus Heresy, internal debate among the elector parliament of Agathon erupted over whether to stay loyal to the Emperor or ally with Horus. Eventually a bloody coup led by Ireton MaSade wiped out the counts and firmly pledged the Agathean Domain to the Emperor. Agathean worlds and forces suffered heavy losses during the subsequent Battle of the Coronid Deeps.
Necromunda (planet)	Necromunda is a Hive World in Segmentum Solar, and a major producer of munitions for the Imperial Guard. Necromunda's forges produce lasguns, autoguns, shotguns, and boltguns, among other weapons. The planet also levies huge numbers of troops for the Imperial Guard (most notably the "Necromundan Spiders"), as well as other supplies. The world has been governed by the House Helmawr for the past seven thousand years.[1d] Necromunda is typical of most hive worlds, its hive cities rife with powerful gangs.[1c] It is rumoured that long ago the Piscean xenos race were the first to arrive on Necromunda, which at the time still had large oceans. It is said they were both cunning and violent and viciously resisted Humanity's conquest of Necromunda years later. According to the legends of House Delaque, the Pisceans vanished shortly before Necromunda became consumed by industry and war. The Delaque believe the Pisceans did not leave Necromunda but instead took refuge in the subterranean oceans near the planet's core as Humanity first began to arrive.[18a] Necromunda was founded 15,000 years ago as a mining and manufacturing colony.[1c] It used to be the capital of the Araneus Continuity, a small empire of Humans ruled by Techno-nobility, who submitted to the Imperium during the Great Crusade.[8h]
Qulus Trine	Qulus Trine is a wealthy merchant world of the Imperium. It is protected on all sides by massive orbital fortresses, manned by a private army, but is overseen by the Emperor's gaze in the form of the Blood Ravens Eighth Company, whose glorious Battle Barge Ominous Insight has made the Qulus system its home.
Grettel	Grettel was held by the Anckorite Brotherhood during Warmaster Ryse's Crusade and the Cult's leader, Luciver Anckor, had a fortress there. It later became a battleground, after the Warmaster charged General Creed with killing Anckor.
Mukaali	Mukaali are a type of xenos utilized by Tallarn Desert Raiders Rough Riders. Sometimes locally referred to as 'Sand Pacers', Mukaali are desert-dwelling herbivores used as large mounts, and are indigenous to the Desert World of Goru-Prime. Tallarn has an agreement with Goru-Prime to import thousands of Mukaali every ten years. Mukaali are capable of living for long periods of times without food or water, but conversely have very poor tolerance to cold climates. Their thick hides generally have a mottled blue/grey colouring, running to a brown/pink underbelly. Trained Mukaali are somewhat dim-witted but well-tempered and placid creatures, lacking any natural aggression - even males can't fight and, when faced with danger unmounted, Mukaali always flee. The main advantage of a Mukaali over a horse is its exceptional endurance and load bearing capability. Their feet are specifically adapted to move over sand at high speeds, and possess large, soft pads which help to spread their weight to avoid sinking in soft sand. Because of these evolutionary advantages, Mukaali-mounted Rough Rider squadrons can range further afield and carry more equipment than a horse-mounted squadron.
Saint Emiline	Saint Emiline was a citizen of the Imperium who, in M40, gave her life to recapture the world of Emiline's Hope from the forces of Chaos. The planet was subsequently named in her honour when she was declared as a Saint. Her bones are interred at the Order of the Bleeding Hearts abbey on the planet, and reclaiming Emiline's bones became a central feat in the tale of Sister Martika.
Lucifere II	Lucifere II is an Arboreal World that the Imperium learned had been invaded by Tyranid vanguard broods. These vanguards were able to call down a full-scale Tyranid invasion upon the life-rich world, but due to Lucifere II's tangled flora, nothing larger than infantry on foot would be able to navigate its terrain. Gunnery Sergeant Stonetooth Harker and his notorious Catachan Devils were chosen to destroy the Tyranids and later successfully exterminated a slew of the vanguard broods.
Neva	Neva is an Imperial world notable for the size and power of its Ecclesiarchy presence.[1a] According to the heretic Torris Vaun, the warp storms that enshrouded the planet for several decades left a residual taint on the population: individuals with psyker ability occurred roughly five times more frequently than anywhere else in the Imperium.[1b] This fact remained a carefully guarded secret for many years, as Lord Deacon Viktor LaHayn collected the least talented of these psykers and tithed them to the League of Blackships, while gathering the more powerful and talented to experiment on inside the Null Keep.[1b]

Following a decisive Imperial victory in the battle known as the Akhar Basin Massacre, the orks were eventually defeated. Most of Balle Prime's surface is not habitable by humans. The only areas capable of sustaining life are regions of the planet's equatorial deserts.
Golgotha	Golgotha is an Ork World, conquered and infested by forces under the command of Ghazghkull Thraka after the Second War for Armageddon. An Imperial attempt to purge the world of the alien taint and execute Ghazghkull took place shortly after the Orks landed on the planet, but met with failure. Since then - apart from a brief, significantly smaller, Imperial expedition to the planet — Golgotha has remained in Ork hands. In 996.M41, Marshal Actoan of the Black Templars led a Crusade to eradicate the Ork presence on Golgotha. After the Second War for Armageddon, Commissar Yarrick tracked Ghazghkull to Golgotha and confronted him in a canyon in the Ishawar mountain range. Here, his force was trapped between Ghazghull's army and a second, similarly sized ork force. In the ensuing battle Yarrick's Baneblade, the Fortress of Arrogance was severely damaged by an Ork Stompa and abandoned during the fight and the Commissar found himself captured.

In the early 35st millennium the Ur-Council of Nova Terra declared themselves independent from the High Lords of Terra and claimed rule of the Segmentum Pacificus. Their reign became known as the Nova Terra Interregnum and lasted for nine centuries. It ended with the outbreak of the religious wars with the Ecclesiarchy known as the Cataclysm of Souls.[2a] The planet was raided by the Ravenwing of the Dark Angels during the conflict after they suspected that the mysterious Cypher was a member of the Ur-Council, though they failed to secure any prisoner. In M41, Nova Terra was again the site of major upheaval when the Renegade Space Marine Constantinus launched a rebellion against Imperial rule.
Vostroya	Vostroya is a world of the Imperium, located in Segmentum Obscurus beyond the Eye of Terror, famous for its Vostroyan Firstborn regiments of the Imperial Guard.[4a][4b] Since the Great Crusade, Vostroya has acted as an industrial world, supplying arms and ammunition to the armies of the Imperium. In the ten thousand years after the crusade, the Vostroyans have continued the same task, living and dying on the production lines and complying with the endless schedule of manufacturing and assembly.[4a] During the Horus Heresy, Vostroya refused to provide regiments to the Emperor, preferring instead to reserve the population in the manufactoria blanketing the world. After the Heresy came to an end, the Vostroyans agreed to supply every first born son to serve in the Imperial Guard regiments, to atone for their sins and repay their debt.[4a]

Maccabeus Quintus	Maccabeus Quintus is a Shrine World in the Calixis Sector. It is home to the Black Order and the Maccabian Janissaries Imperial Guard. A world of vast, dry, salt flats, dust-laden winds, and harsh, chill sun, the fifth planet of the unforgiving Maccabeus system is nevertheless a blessed place, for this is the place where a great man fell and was raised up as a saint by the glory of the Emperor. The chronicles of the Angevin Crusade tell that General Drusus, commanding the Trailward Salient of the Crusade, had pushed towards the Halo Stars, when a sudden and vicious resurgence of hostilities in the region around Spectoris, at his rear, caused his advance to halt, forcing Drusus to order a regrouping. The planet chosen for this gathering was an uninhabited world in the obscure Maccabeus system, and as Drusus' forces gathered, the General himself prayed for guidance, knowing that a wrong choice could jeopardise the fate of the whole crusade. Disaster struck as, employing unholy methods, his enemies discovered Drusus' location and unleashed a deadly assassin against him. Drusus fell, but even as the killing blow was struck did the power of the Emperor rend apart the assassin and spare the great man. After ten days and nights in shadow did Drusus return, and the light of the Emperor was within him. In the years that followed, Drusus knew not defeat; one by one his enemies fell, and from the ashes of his conquest, the Calixis Sector was born. In the centuries following the Crusade, Drusus was declared a Saint.

Standard Template Construct	This article contains text passages or images with citation issues. The concerned content is marked with "Citation issue" tags. Please help to improve this article by fixing those issues as described in the corresponding Help article. Do also note that it is absolutely forbidden to add new information or content to these marked passages as long as the pre-existing citation issues have not been completely resolved. The Standard Template Constructors (STCs) were artificial intelligences created during the Dark Age of Technology (M21 - M23). They are said to have contained the entirety of human technological knowledge up to that point. Following the Age of Technology, the systems became increasingly rare, until becoming lost entirely. In the current Age of the Imperium, the ancient technological knowledge survives only because it was preserved in STC hard copies. An intact Standard Template Constructor is described as a "machine, a vast device made of brilliant white ceramics, silver piping, chromium chambers". The Constructor is controlled by a panel beside it, with amber lights to show its activation. When activated, cowlings near the floor vent steam. When a new creation is finished, a hatch on its side opens up to allow the creation to be retrieved. [1c][1a][1b]
Victus (Planet)	Victus is the first planet of the Modren's Realm System. Victus is the closest planet to the system star. It is a scorched ball of rock.

Due to unbearable conditions on Victus, Vir Modren and his xenoarchaeographers have, so far, refrained from research of the ruins.
Khai-Zhan Uprising	The Khai-Zhan Uprising occurred on the planet of Khai-Zhan in 968.M41 The Uprising was fought between Imperial forces and forces of Chaos, culminating in the Battle of Vogen. The roots of the Khai-Zhan Uprising lay in the corruption of the planet's political system. Under the rule of the Imperium, Khai-Zhan's agricultural success was met with heavy taxes to maintain the Planetary Defense Force (PDF) and commercial infrastructure. Historically, mild corruption afflicted governmental institutions and it was standard practice for the political elite to appropriate modest portions of the tax revenue for themselves. Yet, this did not interfere with the vitality of the economy or the well-being of its workforce and was therefore generally tolerated by the population. The balance between economic vitality and political corruption became unsettled with the appointment of Harikon Kadulus to the governorship of Khai-Zhan. Kadulus, a man of particular greed and expensive tastes, promptly increased taxes on the world's major producers. To finance his lifestyle, the governor took greater and greater sums from the tax revenues, which resulted in higher taxes on producers to replace the funds he appropriated for himself. This economic burden was in turn passed on from the producers to their workforce as the producers recovered their losses by cutting the cost of labor. Within a decade, the workforce and major producing institutions of Khai-Zhan became severely discontented by the economic burdens of escalating corruption.
Port Veruca	Port Veruca is an Imperium world that was raided by the Blood Gorgons Warband.

Da Corpse Lootas then made their escape, but not even Grotsnik's orderlies knew what use he had for the Human specimens they collected.

The Daemon Prince who rules Ichoria knows, however, that their memories of the Daemon World will drive these unfortunate souls insane in a matter of days, a process of degeneration he finds extremely entertaining. The false hope this ritual imparts to the prisoners of this bizarre world is a keener torment than any physical pain the Daemons of Ichoria can devise, for it is the prisoner's own mind that provides the instruments of their torture.
Jorvon VIII	Jorvon VIII is an Imperium world that was invaded by the Tyranids of Hive Fleet Leviathan. The Cadian 833rd and 724th regiments of the Imperial Guard came to Jorvon VIII's aid during the invasion, but they were nearly overwhelmed by the Tyranids' numbers.

In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war.
Krourk Ogryn Auxilia	The Krourk Ogryn Auxilia are formations of feral Ogryns raised from Krourk and deployed by the Imperial Guard. In close quarters fighting they are brutal even for Ogryns and considered little better than Orks. Because of their feral, indiscriminate savagery, they are only rarely used in large formations and always with devastating consequences. Though little can stand against the destructive fury of several thousand berserk Ogryns, their inability to distinguish between friend and foe results in collateral damage often outweighing the advantages of large formations. Many officers in the Imperial Guard consider the Ogryns of Krourk to be a primitive weapon of mass destruction when deployed en-masse. Krourk is a high-gravity steppe world of little use to the Imperium other than its population of Ogryns. The Ogryns of this world live harsh lives and the Imperium has left them to develop on their own. As such the Ogryn of Krourk have developed a highly competitive and violent tribal society. In times of crisis, Departmento Munitorum recruiting forces will descend to the surface and capture a few tribes to be taken to the stars for use in the Imperial Guard.

An Imperial envoy, escorted by Captain Taelos of the Imperial Fists, arrived at T'olku to commence protracted negotiations which would delay the Tau from launching their main offensive on the contested world of Nimbosa. The delaying tactic failed, despite the best efforts of Taelos and the envoy, and the full weight of the Tau forces led by Commander Brightsword fell on Nimbosa before the Imperium’s forces had arrived.

The rare plant Lavandulum Quaddis is native to Quaddis and blooms in purple. As the Angevin Crusade swept through the Calixis Sector, Quaddis was discovered by a small expeditionary fleet under the command of Faustino Haarlock, second son of the Haarlock line. He designated the world as a newly founded open colony, dividing it into independent development fiefdoms and giving it the name Quaddis in reference to an ancient Terran force of judgement. Quaddis was graded as possessing great potential but Haarlock planned for the system of fief ownership to never lapse and create exceptions to the usual run of Imperial law.
Sa'cea	Sa'cea is a T'au Sept, a star system within the T'au Empire.[1a] Sa'cea is a hot, densely populated world.

Beneath these foundations are sprawling Earth Caste facilities while its once inhospitable desserts now teem with trillions of lives.

It was the world in which Rogal Dorn was discovered by the Emperor and many legendary Imperial Fists of the Great Crusade-era such as Fafnir Rann and Archamus hailed from the world. Inwit is a mostly lifeless frigid world of little value, sporting little natural resources and vicious native wildlife. The people of Inwit are barbaric but not unsophisticated, raised to endure and survive the harsh climate. Most of Inwit's population is nomadic, moving between the subterranean ice Hives to trade in weapons, fuel, and technology. Conflict between these roaming clans is common and men learn to defend themselves at a young age. Inwit orbits slowly around a dying star, giving it two atmospheric zones: one of cold ice creaveses and shard-storms and one of dry deserts baking under a relentless sun. Despite these conditions, Inwit managed to establish a small interstellar empire during the Age of Strife. Today they continue to maintain some of the finest shipyards in the Imperium on par with Jupiter or Mars. Its cave-cities are situated under three kilometres of ice and occupy the top ten kilometres of the planetary crusts in a worldwide honeycomb pattern. The rulers of Inwit kept to the old traditions and nomadic lifestyles while they simultaneously built small warfleets for expansion. The clans of Inwit are extremely collective, with the needs of the group outweighing any of the individual. Rogal Dorn spent at least a significant portion of his formative years on Inwit. He is known to have lived amongst the ice-tribe of Dorn during his adolescence and to have considered the sire of one of these tribes as his grandfather. The world is said to have supported ice-hives and to have an unconfirmed technology level; Dorn at one point referred to the Phalanx as something he had constructed, and claims to have been Emperor and warlord of the entire Inwit system. After the coming of the Emperor, the planet was heavily developed into the Imperial Fists original homeworld. Many recruits of the Imperial Fists Legion came from the ice tribes of Inwit, including Archamus, Captain Alexis Polux and Fafnir Rann. During the Horus Heresy Inwit was subjected to a Siege by traitor forces.
Balur	Balur is a world that was conquered by the 2nd Catachan regiment, under the command of Colonel Greiss, with Nork Deddog as a bodyguard. After several battles and four years of fighting, they were successful in the conquest of the planet. One of the fiercest battles, in which Colonel Greiss was wounded, took place at Breakback Hill.
Oscillia IX	Oscillia IX is a planet in the Sabbat Worlds which was occupied by the forces of Chaos. During the Sabbat Worlds Crusade, Oscillia IX was one of several planets targeted in the opening phase of Warmaster Macaroth's ambitious campaign to reach the Cabal Systems, commenced at the end of 765.M41. Unfortunately, the campaign, regarded as a "sure thing" by most of Macaroth's staff, became a fiasco that lasted twenty grueling months, due to several miscalculations by the Imperial commanders. Several of these general officers, including Lord General Lugo, were "New Minted" commanders whom Macaroth had elevated quickly, expecting them - incorrectly, as it turned out - to shine in high command the same way Macaroth had, after his meteoric rise at Balhaut.
Deluge	Deluge is a world of the Galaxy. During the Horus Heresy, Deluge was assailed by the crazed Daemon Prince Angron and his World Eaters. As the fleet led by the Conqueror hung in orbit, Deluge's population was butchered. The slaughter was interrupted by Perturabo's small fleet, which arrived to bring orders that Horus has called for a muster on Ullanor in preparation for the drive on Terra. Kharn appeared before Perturabo and his escort and urged them to leave before it was too late, but soon enough the World Eaters and accompanying Khornate Daemons threw themselves at the Iron Warriors. Several thousand Iron Warriors endured the onslaught with a shield wall and using their own tanks as barriers. Perturabo constantly redeployed the formation, eventually boxing the World Eaters into small pockets. However the situation changed when Angron himself appeared from the stormy sky, viciously attacking Perturabo. The Daemon Primarch was subdued by Perturabo, Volk, the Iron Circle, and other nearby Iron Warriors, and as Angron lay on the ground regenerating an Ultramarines fleet arrived in orbit to kill all upon Deluge's surface. Angron was eventually convinced by Perturabo to come with him, and the Daemon Primarch created a Warp Storm that swallowed the Iron Warriors and World Eaters fleets and allowed them to travel to Ullanor.
Pranagar	Pranagar was once the homeworld of the Sky Sentinels Space Marine Chapter. In the aftermath of the Great Rift's creation, during the 13th Black Crusade, Pranagar was invaded by Chaos forces led by the Daemon Primarch Magnus. Every Sky Sentinel came to their homeworld's defense during the invasion, but it was not enough and the entire Chapter was destroyed, allowing Magnus' forces to overrun Pranagar.
Daedallos	Daedallos is an Imperial world, that lies between Ultramar and the Scourge Stars. Just before the Daemon Primarch Mortarion took part in the Plague Wars, he led his forces to Daedallos and successfully invaded it. They inflicted massive casualties on its population and then poisoned Daedallos with their corruption. Mortarion and his forces quickly departed, to invade Ultramar, but it will take Daedallos' years to recover from their brief invasion. Since it has little strategic importance, Lord Commander Guilliman believes that Mortarion deliberately invaded Daedallos, to make his presence known to Ultramar.
T'au (Planet)	T'au is the homeworld of the T'au, and capital of the T'au Empire. It is located within the Ultima Segmentum, to the galactic north of Ultramar. The planet itself is a hot, dry, arid world primarily covered in savannah and scattered mountain ranges. A small world, T'au hosts only a single continental landmass and is notable for its spectacular sunsets. The little arable land that exists is covered with efficiently-run collective farms managed by the Earth Caste. Cities rise into the sky, covered in white marble, in stark contrast to the Hives of the Imperium. No humans have ever walked on the streets of the capital, located on the equator, and Imperial scans are blocked by some T'au technology. At the centre of this city appears to be a heavily defended fortress, possibly the heart of the T'au Empire, the high council of the Ethereals.[Needs Citation] T'au is home to a large moon known as Lu'val, which was the first off-world colony of the T'au Empire in 533.M37. The planet was discovered by the Imperium at 789.M35 by the Land's Vision, an Explorator vessel of the Adeptus Mechanicus, shortly before the Age of Apostasy. The planet was scheduled for cleaning and re-colonisation by an Imperial Navy fleet but the fleet was destroyed in a freak warp storm. The T'au planet itself was surrounded by vast warp storms, cutting off the entire region. During this time, the world was plunged into a brutal civil war known to the T'au as the Mont'au (or 'The Terror'), which only ended with the arrival of the mysterious Ethereals who unified the planet shortly after. Only six thousand years later, the T'au Empire spanned 300 light years.[Needs Citation]
Y'gharnak	Y'gharnak is a Daemon World that lies on the fringes of the Eye of Terror. Rather than a solid world, Y'gharnak is a collection of spinning sphere-cages that are made from red-hot bronze bars that scorch and burn the flesh of those incarcerated within them. It is the fate of those that have drunk another's blood under the eye of a Chaos God to languish in these burning cages, and the only way they can alleviate the unbearable heat of their cage is to paint its bars with their own blood. In defiance of physical law, the area of space in which these damned individuals float is permeated by the all-pervading stench of burning flesh — a smell most pleasing to the cackling leviathan that squats at the core of Y'gharnak.
Neutra	Neutra was the homeworld of the Relictors Space Marine Chapter. Following the discovery that the Chapter was making use of Chaos artefacts, the Inqusition's Ordo Hereticus forced the Relictors to forfeit their homeworld and relinquish their collection of relics. The Relictors became a Fleet Based Chapter, operating out of a Ramilies-class star fort.
Inferria-Prime	Inferria-Prime is a world known for its extreme heat during its summer season.
Thranx	Thranx was a Hive World in the Segmentum Solar. It was liberated by the Imperium during the Great Crusade. It suffered a planet-wide rebellion in M36. At some point afterwards, it was the subject of Exterminatus. During the Great Crusade, Thranx was liberated by the Imperium. At that time, Thranx was a thriving Hive World. Thranx was described as being a world completely encased in steel where the citizenry never saw the sky. The governor's hall was described as being so vast, that clouds formed under the ceilings and rain occasionally fell. During the Horus Heresy, Thranx was invaded by the Warmaster's forces and over a million soldiers lost their lives in battle during a single day.
Secunda	Secunda is a planet near the Eye of Terror. In their pursuit of the Word Bearers Chaos Lord Zymran, Captain Kruger's Ultramarines Company received reports of Chaos activity on the planet.

The Space Marines stand against the darkness, and yet on countless battlefields they play unwitting roles in the schemes of Fateweaver. From the doomed world of Ilissus, through the embattled corridors of the Endeavour of Will, to the borders of the Eye of Terror itself – friend and foe alike follow the great plan that he set in motion many thousands of years ago. But not even the Architect of Fate himself can foresee the destiny that lies in wait for him...

The Astra Militarum forces of the Krieg 1st Heavy Tank Company (Baneblades), Krieg 11th Heavy Tank Company (including at least one Macharius Vanquisher)[4b] and the Tekarn 83rd Mechanised Infantry Regiment, are among those that fought against the Genestealers.[4a] Years later, during the Second Tyrannic War, Radnar was invaded by Hive Fleet Kraken, though the Scythes of the Emperor came to aid the Hive World. Like they had done on so many other worlds before, since the loss of their Homeworld Sotha, the Scythes built up the defenses of Radnar and trained its population in warfare to aid in its defense. This was not enough, however, and despite the defenders' best efforts, the Tyranids soon engulfed the Hive World. The Scythes were able to escape the doomed world and took with them many of its young that showed promise as Aspirants, in order to rebuild their Chapter. After Hive Fleet Kraken was later defeated on Ichar IV, however, the Astra Militarum was deployed to reclaim Radnar. They now fight Kraken's remnants through the ruined Hive World and the Emperor's Shield Regiment has been able to reclaim the Jourmall Hive.

Vhomarl	Vhomarl is an Imperium world that was brought into Compliance during the Great Crusade. At some point in that era, a decommissioned battleship was placed in the world's orbit, which later came to be used as a training facility for the Legio Astartes.
Saturn	Saturn is a gas giant in the Sol System located within the Segmentum Solar. It is noteworthy for housing the headquarters of the Ordo Malleus of the Inquisition. During the Age of Strife, the rings and the moons served as the home of an advanced independent polity known as the Saturnyne Ordo, with its military arm being known as the Saturnine Fleet. Additionally, a Mechanicum Tech-Enclave banished from Mars made its home of Saturn's ninth moon, where they had a hand in the development of Saturnine Terminator Armour and Saturnine Dreadnought technology. As the Age of Strife came to a close, the miniature empire based at Saturn encountered the fledgling Imperium of Man, which they saw as a brother empire. A treaty was signed with the Emperor that merged the two during the years leading to the Great Crusade. However, portions of the Saturn system were occupied by a rival faction, the so-called Ringers, who fought against and were conquered by the Imperium. Moreover, the Moons of the planet became occupied by cruel Xenos overlords which enslaved their human inhabitants. These moons would not be liberated until the planet fell to the Emperor during the Great Crusade.
Medusa (Hive World)	This article includes background material from a Black Library publication released under the Heretic Tomes banner. It may contain parts which are considered outdated.

Ophelion	Ophelion is an Imperium world. In 992.M41 Imperial Governor Schwachgeist was sent a message from The Remnants' Chapter Master stating that he had failed in his duties of governing Ophelion — among them, protecting its tithes and the souls of its citizens. The message continued that as a consequence of his many failures, The Remnants were descending upon Ophelion to remove him from office and that Schwachgeist should accept this judgement in the hopes that the Emperor would find something of worth when he judged the ragged remains of the Governor's soul.
Sicarus	Sicarus is a Daemon World within the Eye of Terror and the current homeworld of the Word Bearers Legion and the domain of their Daemon Primarch Lorgar. Shortly before the Infidus Imperator was destroyed in the aftermath of the Battle of Calth, Kor Phaeron cut a hole in the materium to escape. Stepping through, he arrived upon Sicarus, declaring it, A place of sanctuary. In a place of freedom. In a place where our enemies can never touch us. Beneath a roiling sky of fire and blood, Sicarus is a world completely covered by vast sprawling cathedrals, temples and monuments dedicated to the worship of the Ruinous Powers. Spider-legged cranes and slaves numbering in the millions constantly toil in a never-ending task to raise more structures of devotion and worship, level upon level atop the existing older crumbling edifices and cathedrals, producing obelisks and spires many kilometres high. As a result the majority of buildings are subterranean; a labyrinthine warren of interconnected structures devoted to the worship of chaos.[Needs Citation]
Bekrin	Bekrin was a Shrine World of the Imperium that was destroyed by the Tyranids of Hive Fleet Dagon.
Valon Urr	Valon Urr is a Shrine World in the Calixis Sector. Formerly a Civilized World, Valon Urr was besieged by the nearby world of Sinophia during the War of Hubris in 467.M39.

The world was declared a Shrine World in 601.M39 in honor of the sacrifice of millions of civilians.

Lissandro	Lissandro was a world of the Imperium that was overrun by daemons of Tzeentch. In 383.M41, the Warp Storm Iagon visited its fury upon the world, causing the ruling body of the planet, the Quarrum Immaculate, to scour their ancient libraries for an answer. They eventually discovered an ancient and mysterious hexagrammatic symbol that legend said could ward off the powers of the Warp. Within a month, all registered citizens had the symbol implanted upon them. When the Inquisition later reached the planet with a fleet of Black Ships, the citizens with the implants began to convulse and Pink Horrors rose from their corpses. By sunset, the cities of Lissandro were overrun. The Inquisitors, under siege at the Quarrum's palace, requested the aid of the Grey Knights. However by the time they arrived, every city on the planet had been devoured. The Grey Knights took the battle to those Daemons still remaining, and when they entered the ancient libraries that were the original source of information for the hexagrammic symbol, they found the Blue Scribes waiting. The Scribes vanished into the Warp and it becomes clear that the symbol left in the library was not one of banishment, but invitation.
Heterodyne	Heterodyne is a Feudal World in the Calixis Sector. Also called Uziel, the colony was ceded into Mechanicus control. The Magos maintain a light hand, subtly influencing the planet’s development and infiltrating its elite with advisors. Now feudal primitivism and the techno-arcane exist side-by-side: cyber-augmented beasts pull the ploughs in fields still sown by hand, and liveried Gun Servitors patrol the battlements of stone castles. The aristocracy embrace the Omnissiah and its servants as the ultimate guarantee of their power. The Lathe Worlds which started this experiment maintain a carefully disguised fortress to preserve what some in their ranks consider a proper worship of technology. The Tech-Barons, Serfitors, and Fiedelus Knights here are unique to this particular form of anachronistic culture.
Visse'el	The Visse'el System contained one frozen water world which the Tau had established fishing colonies upon. During the early stages of the Imperial Damocles Gulf Crusade it was deemed of no strategic value to take, so was bombarded from space as to melt the planet's ice, destroying the colonies. It is located in the Ultima Segmentum in the Kendeal subsector.

She is the mother of Eldanesh and by extension the mortal Eldar race and it was she who inspired the creation of Asuryan's barrier between the mortals and their gods after Khaine's torrent of destruction. It is said that from her tears, weapoing out of love for her mortal son, that the first life blossomed and the Aeldari were born , and it is also said that spirit stones are made from the remnants of her tears. The spirit stones allowed the gods and mortals to communicate with each other. One of these stones was given to Isha and the rest to the Eldar. When Asuryan learned that his order had been violated he gave Isha and her lover, Kurnous, to Khaine to do with as he wished. Khaine tortured the two of them in a burning pit until Vaul, the only Eldar god who was moved to, struck a bargain with the war god to create one hundred swords for him in exchange for their release. Vaul failed in his task but tricked Khaine and when Khaine found out it sparked off a war between him and Vaul. During the Fall of the Eldar all the Eldar gods except Khaine and Cegorach were destroyed by Slaanesh. Isha, however, was claimed by Slaanesh as his prize. She cried out for help and was heard by Nurgle who entered into a long war with his newest peer. Nurgle emerged victorious and took Isha as his companion. A goddess of rejuvenation and a god of decay seemed an odd pairing, but Nurgle adores her like no other. However, Nurgle shows his adoration as only a Chaos God can, keeping her trapped in a cage in the Garden of Nurgle, in the corner of a room where he keeps the cauldron in which he creates all of his plagues.

During the Nova Terra Interregnum, it joined with the Ur-Council of Nova Terra. However in a twist of fortune, Warp Storms isolated Persepolis in the aftermath of the Interregnum and spared it from the vengeful purges of the Ecclesiarchy once Imperial authority over Segmentum Pacificus was reestablished. In M41 it reestablished contact with the Imperium but refused to re-assimilate, and as a result was one of the first to fall to the Macharian Crusade under Sejanus. The planet held the tomb of the ancient and famed Imperial explorer Indijona the Vagrant.

The Planet is ruled by the Council of Seven Colours. The majority of the population of Hilarion is composed of the peasant and serf classes (with little distinction between the two). They work in service to the Noble Houses and toil to produce spices and incense for their Lords, who then export them off world, although this is not known to the peasants – they simply believe that the Emperor requires their labour. Hilarion is populated by a majority of peasants. A smaller number of Nobles make up the ruling class while the balance of the populace is a very small percentage of Serfs, who have become indentured for failure to meet their contractual obligations of service and provide for their families. The technology level is mostly medieval, although the Noble Houses have a small number of devices that would be seen in the wider Imperium.

Little was known of the planet until it became a central part of an Inquisitorial investigation led by Inquisitor Gregor Eisenhorn.[1a] At the time of Eisenhorn's visit, the entire system was self-destructing, its ancient star beginning to lose its cohesion. The system was strewn with debris, asteroids and clouds of deadly radiation. The crust of third largest planet, which was as ruined as the rest of the system, opened into a gaping wound leading to the uncanny vastness of a tetrascape.[1a] There, the traitorous forces under Oberon Glaw rendezvoused with the saruthi.[1b] It was here that Eisenhorn and his group managed to destroy the Terran copy of the Necroteuch, along with killing the Chaos Space Marine Mandragore of the Emperor's Children Traitor Legion, Captain Estrum, and Oberon Glaw.[1c]

This cult was the subject of Ecclesiarch Goge Vandire's visit to the planet, where a hundred thousand servants and soldiers formed a procession miles long to reach the temple of the Daughters, the streets lined with citizens from start to finish to celebrate and show respect to the Ecclesiarch at the behest of a Lasgun at their backs, typical of the Reign of Blood.[1a] At this time, the Daughters numbered some five hundred members.[1a] The Ecclesiarch was initially barred from the temple, but the Sisterhood became convinced of the Ecclesiarch's divine favor upon the demonstration of a Rosarius, indicating that the world was not too familiar with rare and advanced forms of technology. The entire cult was promptly made High Lord Vandire's personal bodyguard and was renamed to the Brides of the Emperor and moved to Terra[1b], where many years later the cult served as the foundation for the Adepta Sororitas, thus making San Leor the Sisterhood's home planet.[1c]
Battle of Eagle Gate	The Battle of Eagle Gate was a clash between the Imperium and a large force of Word Bearers under the Daemon Prince Kor Megron on the Shrine World of Eydolim in 946.M41. To Kor Megron and his Word Bearers warband, known as The Foresworn, defiling the Shrine World of Eydolim was one of their greatest desires. Before turning to the powers of Chaos, they had discovered the planet and erected great cathedrals in the Emperor's service during the Great Crusade. In preparation for their grand offensive against the planet, Kor Megron sought out alliances with other Chaos Space Marine warbands. He succeeded in recruiting forces from Sons of Damnation, Corpsemakers, Night Lords, Red Corsairs, Iron Warriors, and Gladiator Group 138, bolstering his initial force of 200 Word Bearers to many hundred. He also acquired the aid of the Legio Excruciatus and Legio Interfector, two Traitor Titan Legions. With his new allies in hand, Kor Megron set out for the Eydolim System. The first assault Kor Megron and his allies undertook was against the Hive World of Jones Crispin World. With his fleet quickly entering orbit, the Chaos forces took the Imperial defenders by surprise. The World Eaters of Gladiator Group 138 led the assault against the largest Hive, Fort Crispin, massacring all in their path. Frantic pleas for aid were sent out by the worlds Astropaths, and a force of Imperial Fists responded to the call, having been deployed nearby to combat the Tau Empire. The Imperial Fists and World Eater forces battled for weeks in bloody trench warfare around Fort Crispin. The Imperial Fists became bogged down in the fighting and were unable to aid any other world in the system, which soon also came under Chaos assault.

The world is given over entirely to the worship of the Emperor. Its surface is covered in mile-high cathedrals and bell towers, linked by avenues lined with the statues of thousands of Imperial Saints. Dungeons plunge deep into the bowels of the world, where heretics are made to repent their sins, subject to such methods of soul-cleansing as arco-flagellation, death-masking, soul-scouring and the Trial of Castigation. Ophelia VII was the centre of the Adeptus Ministorum from the time of Ecclesiarch Benedin IV to Greigor XI and is still one of the main centres of Ministorum power to this day, second only to Terra. It is located far from its sister planet of Terra, in the galactic south.
Klybo	An extinct world, where the ruins of a lost colony poke from the sifting sands. Klybo's harsh environment spurned all efforts to settle it. The Sector Fleet maintains a waystation on a moon in close orbit.[2b] Klybo has become a proverbial term over the years, indicating a worthless or doomed effort. "It all went like Klybo" or "I tried my best, but I had a day on Klybo" are common sector euphemisms.[2b] Klybo is a particular haunt of prospectors and tech-archaeologists. It is rumoured that fabulous STC finds are hidden on Klybo, remnants of the colonial attempts to settle the world. Several myths report "walking monsters", akin to Ambulon, still striding the wastelands. No form of conclusive data has yet been obtained.[2b]
Temaxia	Temaxia is an Imperial forge world, located in the Uhulis Sector of the Segmentum Tempestus. In M32, the space hulk Da Iron Worm carried marauding orks across the Uhulis Sector.

The Planetary Governor tricked his Adeptus Arbites into quelling a prison break that turned out to be a carefully crafted ambush, trapping the Arbitrators in the same prison alongside those they had arrested. Word reached the Imperium, and two regiments of Imperial Guard were sent to intervene. The aristocrats leading the rebellion attacked with their own forces, only to find that their chief military advisory, the mercenary known as Le Kard, was not who they thought he was and vanished. The leaderless Orlenza forces were surrounded and cut off within a week. It is eventually revealed that Le Kard had been replaced by a Callidus Assassin.

Iocanthos	Iocanthos also known as Iocanthus is a lawless world dominated by warlords and their huge armies, which clash across its jungles, forests and plains. The planet's importance in the Calixis Sector is defined by the fact that it is one of the few places in the Imperium where the Ghostfire Flower can grow. Ghostfire Pollen can be refined into the combat drugs used extensively in the Penal Legions of the Imperial Guard.[2a] Every five years, a taskforce of Administratum officials descends onto Iocanthos to gather the planet's Ghostfire Flower tithe. The warlords exchange their harvests of Ghostfire Pollen with the Administratum in exchange for weapons, vehicles, fuel, clean water and other essentials. The warlord who hands over the most Ghostfire pollen is considered the Planetary Governor and claims the lion's share of support from the Imperium and the title Vervai (literally "prince of princes" or "king").[2a]
Paramar	Paramar is a world of the Imperium, located within the Segmentum Solar. It was on this planet that Sergeant Balzach of the Storm Lords Chapter was taken alive during the battle with the World Eaters. Later, after humiliating torture, Balzach became Zhufor the Impaler, Chaos Lord of the Skulltakers. Evidence suggests that some of the Lords of Paramar helped Fabius Bile in nurturing mutants for his mysterious experiments. One of these talented psykers is The Howling Man, who can raise his voice to devastating effect.
Sycorax (Death World)	Sycorax is a Death World of the Imperium located in the Ultima Segmentum. Sycorax is a Death World wracked by psychic storms. Psykers exposed to these conditions will attract the fierce storms unless they learn to shield themselves with their own psychic ability. The Adeptus Astra Telepathica maintain a training facility on Sycorax in order to train their adepts in the extreme environment it offers. During the Indomitus Crusade Sycorax found itself assailed by Necrons which include a shard of the Nightbringer and large amounts of Flayed Ones. The planet's populace was captured and subjected to a series of grizzly experiments and ritual sacrifices. With the aid of Uriel Ventris and his 4th Company Ultramarines forces as well as Imperial Guard, Lucius Mechanicum, and Legio Astorum Titans the Imperial forces were able to drive the Necrons off the world.[2a]
Herodor	Herodor is a planet which saw major action during the Sabbat Worlds Crusade. During Saint Sabbat's original crusade to liberate the sector from Chaos, Herodor was where she rested to cleanse her wounds; as a result the waters of the Civitas became a sacred site, although the planet itself was of little strategic importance. During the later stages of the Sabbat Worlds Crusade, the world was assaulted by a massive Chaos force led by Magister Enok Innokenti, because of the rumour that a reincarnated Saint Sabbat was marshalling Imperial forces on the planet. In the battle which ensued, the Saint did apparently appear to lead the Imperial forces to eventual victory.
Thoth	Thoth is an Imperial world in the Segmentum Pacificus. It was discovered during the Macharian Crusade and the Imperium fought to liberate the Human populated Desert World, from the Chaos-worshiping Witches of Thoth. The Tallarn Desert Raiders 3rd regiment, were especially chosen to fight in the desert environment and were led by Captain Al'rahem. He later used Thoth's native N'go tribesmen to conducted a guerrilla campaign against the Seercult. During the battle, a landing craft carrying Captain Al'rahem and a portion of the Tallarn 3rd malfunctioned and crashed into territory held by the Witches of Thoth. The Regiment's survivors then fought their way back to safety, as the Captain led a rearguard against the Seercult. The Inquisition soon afterwards declared Thoth Amundi Heretica and had the world cleansed of all life by virus bombs.
Duthovan	Duthovan served as a recruitment world for the Dark Angels Legion during the Great Crusade. The world was known for its stormy seas and mountainous archipelagos, while Duthovan's population were famous for their strength and boldness. They learned to navigate their entire world in flimsy catamarans and these attributes led the Dark Angels to Duthovan, in search of future Legionaries. During the Horus Heresy, some of Warmaster Horus' traitor forces were stranded on Duthovan, due to the Ruinstorm. Upon learning of this, the Ultramarines Captain Roscius attempted to isolate them on the world and took part in the Duthovan Blockade. The Captain then invaded with the Ultramarines and other Legion forces that he commanded. Few Loyalists or Traitors survived the war that followed and Duthovan was the last known warzone that Roscius took part in.
Ironhelm	Ironhelm is a Forge World of the Imperium. A decade-long siege on the world by Waaagh! Bludcrumpa was finally broken in 901.M41 by a Blood Angels strikeforce led personally by Commander Dante. The Forge World produces a pattern of Thunder Hammers scaled for human use.

Without warning, the ship comes under attack by Chaos Space Marines of the Black Legion, and it falls to Delassio and his battle-brothers to repel the boarders. But his exemplary record in battle and his righteous hatred of the xenos is marred by the secret shame he carries with him, the curse of his Chapter's bloodline...

Woe	Woe is a Death World in the Calixis Sector. It is a solitary world beneath a dim star. The surface is a drear place of endless, oily bogs, shrouded in malodorous mists, beasts of poisonous aspect, where rebreathers struggle with the thick air.[2b] Woe was visited by Inquisitor Felroth Gelt and his retinue in 770.M41 whilst pursuing survivors of the Brotherhood of Horned Darkness chaos cult controlled by the daemon Baphomael. After this encounter, during which the world itself seemed to be alive and hostile, the planet was determined to be a Death World and off limits.[2b] No psyker has determined anything similar to this malign mind.[2a] Cardinal Quiro Olranna of the Josian Reach Arch-Diocese has stationed an orbital shrine above Woe and wishes to eradicate the heretics and cleanse the planet of whatever mind controls it.
Hydra Minoris	Hydra Minoris is the first planet of the Hydra Cordatus System.

Pyran Dragoons	The Pyran Dragoons are Imperial Guard Regiments from the planet Pyran. These regiments were originally founded in M34 as the Tyler Grenadiers as a counter to Chaos incursions following the Sinto Uprising in the Justicar sub-sector. The regiment was finally deposited on Pyran as the war swept into the Armageddon Sector. The regiment broke the main Chaos army and were able to claim Right of Conquest on Pyran. This is the only recorded incidence of Right of Conquest in the Armageddon Sector, a source of great pride for the people of Pyran. Pyran officers are often extremely intolerant of other cultures, who have not had the Pyran's schooling in the intricacies of the Pyran honour code. The Pyran regiments as a whole have gained a reputation as arrogant, uncooperative prima donnas.
Charo	The planet Charo was brought into compliance by the Imperium during the Great Crusade.
Yulan	Yulan is a Dead World located in the Tarsis Ultra System. This world was inhospitable to terraforming and colonization due to the geological instability and volcanism on the surface.

Rayvenscrag IV	Rayvenscrag IV is a world of the Imperium. The Retribution Class Battleship Cardinal Boras was constructed in the shipyards above the planet.
Rocyria	"A small agriworld that produces intensively farmed and mass-harvested grain crops. Rocyrians are the butt of many jokes, considered 'backwards' by other Moebians, and yet they are hard-working and honest to a fault."[1a] The entire surface of the planet is devoted to farming and raising livestock on an unimaginable scale to meet near-impossible quotas. Expansive grain fields[1c] and industrial-scale algae farms are the bulk of the planet's exports.[1b] The livestock raised are Grox and are also raised and slaughtered in vast quantities.[1b] The dress uniforms of Moebian regiments raised from Rocyria consist of a muted pallette with brown, earthy hues. They often use these uniform as woodland camouflage. The Rocyrian regiments tend to be the poorest of the Moebian Guard regiments. When compared to regiments raised from Atoma Prime or Branx Magna, they are seen as poorer cousins.
Saint Sabbat	Saint Sabbat (also known as the Saint Beati Sabbat or the Sabbat Beati) is an Imperial Saint.[6b] Saint Sabbat was described as a small but beautiful green eyed girl with short black hair. She was born in mid-M35 on the pastoral world of Hagia, in the Segmentum Pacificus, to a simple chelon shepherd.[6a][6b] At this time, while humans loyal to the Imperium had established footholds in the region, much of it was incredibly wild, ruled by the hand of Chaos as well as hostile Xenos. Even those planets that were ostensibly loyal to the Emperor were well outside the bounds of the Civitas Imperialis. Little is known in detail of her history but what is known is that in her early life she was inspired by a vision of the Emperor to rally humanity and liberate the entire region in a great crusade against the Ruinous Powers. Her achievements overshadow those of many a Lord General Militant, while her teachings lead all Imperial citizens to a simplicity and wisdom that reflected her humble origins.
Vulkard IV	Vulkard IV is a Volcanic World and a current war zone for the T'au Empire.
Kanak Skull Takers	The Kanak Skull Takers are a brutal Imperial Guard Regiment from volcano-wracked Feral World of Kanak, which is home to many fierce barbarian tribes. The Kanaks are savage, tattooed warriors and are easily able to match the brutality of races such as Orks. It is also said that (much like the Catachans) many of these tribes are closer to an Ogryn than a baseline human being, both in size and attitude. Their talent for slaughter quickly found its way into the Imperial Guard, where considerable tolerance for their feral tactics has been seen. Like many feral regiments, service in the Imperial Guard is intended to teach the savage Kanak Imperial ways, so that if they ever return to their homeworld, they will hopefully provide a civilising influence to the rest of the indigenous population. Kanak warriors are armed for close combat, and regiments are known to utilize Ogryns and Rough Riders. Instead of normal lasguns, Kanak Skull Takers infantry carry various forms of close combat weapons and laspistols. Some even wield two primitive weapons. They prefer flamers, but rarely use heavy weapons, due to the feral nature of the regiments.
Antecanis Massacre	The Antecanis Massacre was an attack by Abaddon the Despoiler's Black Legion on the Imperial world of Antecanis IV in M37 during the 9th Black Crusade At the dawn of the 37th Millennium Antecanis was a teeming Hive World that supplied labour to the nearby Imperial Navy dockyards at Cancephalus. Knowing that the Imperial Navy docks were heavily defended, Abaddon chose to strike at its most vulnerable point - the world from which the workers came. Without the supply of millions of workers, Cancephalus's dockyards would fall silent. Making various pacts with other Chaos forces such as the World Eaters, Word Bearers, The Purge, Apostles of MinthRas, and the Daemon Prince Dhar'leth, Abaddon and his allies fell upon Antecanis. Abaddon's Battle Barges and Grand Cruisers overwhelmed the orbital defences. After seven days, fusion bombs and vortex torpedoes rained down from orbit onto the Antencanis Hives. As millions died, dropships poured onto the surface and disgorged hundreds of ruthless Chaos Space Marines.
Medusa V	Some text passages and/or images of this article have been removed due to insufficient Citations and placed under Quarantine on this article's Discussion page until proper citations have been provided. You can help to restore them to the article by finding the correct citations and re-integrating the quarantined text and/or images as described in the Help article on citations. Medusa V was an Imperial Mining World and Industrial World. It had orbital distance of 1.41AU, gravity of 1.12G and an average temperature of 9 degrees Celsius.[1a] The history of Medusa V is tightly linked with that of its sister planet, Medusa IV. The Medusa System may have gone unnoticed had it not been for the huge Warp Storm named "Van Grothe's Rapidity" located very close to the Medusa System.[1a] Medusa IV and V were colonised to provide both resources and a staging post for ships attempting to sling through the relatively stable warp storm, giving them vast improvement in travel times, although at a much higher risk of destruction. When the Explorator fleet arrived, a Clan Company of the Iron Hands came with them to provide tactical assistance in case they encountered any native indigenous life forms. The Medusa System was named in honour of the Iron Hands, a tribute to their own homeworld.[1b]
Urdesh	Urdesh is a Forge World located in the Belt of Iron, and was the primary supplier of the Sabbat Worlds Crusade. Contact with Urdesh was first established by the Explorator Fleets of Mars during the Great Crusade. During the Age of Strife the world had lost much, including the knowledge to build new Titans. It proved of great interest to the Imperium thanks to it possessing the knowledge required to produce vast numbers of arms for the Imperial Army. The world peacefully assimilated into the Imperium after being offered a chance to replenish their Titan Legion, the Legio Damicium.[Needs Citation] During the Great Crusade Urdesh was still only a minor world in the Belt of Iron that fed the war machine of the Imperial Army. When the Horus Heresy began the world was desperate to maintain its sizable Titan Legion and was dependent on Mars for aid, which saw it join the forces of the Warmaster. During the Heresy they ferried supplies into Segmentum Solar, aiding the traitor Mechanicum in establishing small cells of saboteurs that worked to undermine Imperial defenses around Terra.[3a] For this crime Malcador the Sigillite dispatched a force of Legio Ignatum from Terra, which together with loyalists in the Belt of Iron purged the planet in the final stages of the Cataclysm of Iron.[3b]
Magog (Planet)	Magog was a Chaos Fortress World in the Magog System, one of the Charon Stars near the Hadex Anomaly in the Jericho Reach, Ultima Segmentum. It was originally an Imperial Agri World until it came under the influence of the Hadex Anomaly. Despite being overrun by daemons, it continued to produce vast amounts of food as well as troops, and was considered a vital asset to the Chaos forces during the Achilus Crusade. As a result the planet was heavily defended, including possibly by a Blackstone Fortress.[1a] Before the Hadex Anomaly manifested, Magog was the only inhabitable planet in the binary pulsar Magog System, filled with citizens loyal to The Emperor and the Imperial Creed. It was a stable Agri World, with indigenous life, abundant crops, and rivers full of water.[1a] When the Hadex Anomaly appeared in 656.M40,[1b] it expanded and contracted, drawing in and ejecting Magog countless times over millennia. This had a substantial effect on the planet, which was tainted by the Warp. The surface ebbed and flowed, as if the planet was breathing, while landmasses, including mountain ranges, began to migrate on a whim, and were often subsumed beneath the surface, reappearing in a different place days or decades later. Its rivers no longer flowed with water, but blood.[1a]
Tygress I	Tygress I is a Frontier World in the Calixis Sector.

This has led the Adeptus Mechanicus and Xenos fleets to seek out the lost forge. Unknown to the Tech-Priests of the Imperium however is that the masters of Nullivar are not dead, and they have crafted their own plans over ten millennia of exile.
Heckla	Heckla is a world of ice and fire, its permanently frozen surface is rocked by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, emanating from its molten heart. Based on its name, it is believed that the planet was discovered in the distant past by the Space Wolves or Leman Russ himself. During the 13th Black Crusade, an Araken artefact called the Heklarunsten was destroyed by the forces of Chaos on the planet. The energy released from its destruction increased the size of the nearby Araken Warpstorm, somehow dissipating its energy in the process. The Heklarunsten's destruction drew the attention of Magos Omega Thule, who began a search for the remaining Araken artefacts in the region. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Teruxyne	Teruxyne is a former Imperial Colony World that was declared to be a Forbidden World, after it had been stricken with the Sinners' Plague Warp disease. This occurred after a heretek laboratory hidden on the Colony World, unleashed the disease which corrupted the minds and bodies of its population. The Inquisition would later destroy the laboratory from orbit and also purged Teruxyne's stricken population. It is now a Forbidden World, forever claimed by the virulent Sinners' Plague, where none but the Ordos have set foot on since.
Lacusta	Lacusta is a Feral World in the Calixis Sector, home of the Windriders Imperial Guard Regiment.
Racion	Racion is an Imperium Feudal World that may be the next target for an Ork Waaagh! which recently conquered the Forge World Glomus.
Galaspar	Galaspar is a Hive World of the Imperium. Settled during the Dark Age of Technology, the ancient civilization of Galaspar grew distinct and separate from the emerging Imperium of Man. Its surface was covered with massive Hives that rival those found within Segmentum Solar. Outside of the fortified hives, millennia of unbound human population expansion and industrial spoil had obliterated the planet's environment and rendered Galaspar an arid, irradiated wasteland. During the Age of Strife, Galaspar fell under the control of a tyrannical junta simply known as "The Order", which reduced its population to nameless labour units that were immediately euthanized when they were no longer able to work. The Order maintained its rule through mass terror and spreading addictive substances throughout the population. Thus it was that the people of Galaspar were rendered into humble and meek masses who would quietly obey authority. Soon Galaspar expanded its power, taking control of the surrounding worlds of its system in a pocket empire.
Troudor	Troudor is an Imperial world. This planet was part of the empire of Cardinal Bucharis during the Plague of Unbelief period. It was one of the earliest planets to revolt under the influence of Confessor Dolan Chirosius.
Ixya	A frozen world, Ixya was an Imperial Mining World and the foremost provider of essential ores and precious metals to the Forge Worlds of the Chthonian Chain. The only settlement on the planet was the Mechanicus mining facility Aes Metallum. The Imperial Fists Strike Cruiser Fury's Blade picked up an automated distress call being broadcasted from Ixya on its return to the Phalanx. Wanting to investigate the distress call but needing to return to the Phalanx, it was decided to send a Thunderhawk with a single squad to the planet. Under the command of Sergeant Hesperus, the Imperial Fists met with Planetary Governor Selig and learned of a missing explorator team, last reported in the area of the distress call. Traveling to the area, the Imperial Fists located the remains of the explorator team, as well as Necron structures that had emerged from the ice. As they surveyed the structures, they were attacked by Necrons and returned to Aes Metallum to prepare its defences. While they readied the facility, they sent a message requesting aid to the Glory of Gehenna, a Mechanicus transport vessel in system to gather minerals from Aes Metallum to send to nearby Forge Worlds.
Octarius System	The Octarius System is a System in Ultima Segmentum. It is the center of the Ork Empire of Octarius.
Bubonicus (Character)	Lothar (now known as Bubonicus and the daemonic name Ghur'urgh bu'yue)[1a] was a mortal Champion of Nurgle, born on a backwards planet which remains cut off from the Imperium by warp storms. Raised to daemonhood, he now rules a daemon world within the Eye of Terror, also named Bubonicus.[1b] During the Horus Heresy, Bubonicus was one of many daemons summoned by Erebus, First Chaplain of the Word Bearers, by a dark ritual conducted during the Battle of Calth, presumably as a prelude to Horus's attack on the Imperial Palace during the Battle of Terra.
Omeros	Omeros was the site of a battle between the Iron Knights Chapter and the Dark Eldar. During the battle, Captain Cadulon was captured and dragged through a Webway Portal by the Dark Eldar.
Pimonedes Alpha	Pimonedes Alpha was the site of a battle between the Ultramarines and Tyranids.
Pharaxes	Pharaxes is an Imperial world, that was invaded by Tyranids in early M42. However these incursions were later suppressed by the Knight Houses Stryder and Rau.
Landunder	Landunder is an Imperial Hive World. Landunder was colonized during the Great Founding in 450.M39. Though Landunder is classified as a Hive World, many Tech-Priests have treated Landunder as a Death World due to the world's caustic atmosphere and lack of natural lifeforms, even at the micro-level. People from Landunder call themselves Landrians and organize themselves into clans. Notably, Clan Render, nominally meat-mongers and tanners, have a sadistic and sinister reputation due to their links with murder-cults and criminal atrocities.
Sameter	Sameter is a world of the Imperium, located in the Helican Subsector. Sameter is a centre for agro-chemical production and used to be the pre-eminent world of the subsector, before the capital was moved to Thracian Primaris some time before 241.M41. After that it was in terminal decline, as competition from the hives of Thracian Primaris had forced the planetary governor to relax controls on pollution in order to compete. Instead of resurrecting the local economy, it lead to a further decline in production. Uber Aemos noted during an Inquisitorial investigation in 241.M41 that Sameter had a notable, but not unusual, level of criminal activity. This primarily took the form of narcotics trafficking and mob violence (the latter usually linked to the former), but "...nothing really markedly heretical."
Kragh	Kragh is a Knight World that was discovered by the Imperium in 112.M41, after the Warp Storm it had been trapped in for twenty millennia finally abated. Initial attempts to integrate the Knight World into the Imperium were met with deadly force by its two Knight Houses, until the venerable Kragh Knight Seneschal Jakobus acted on the Imperium's behalf. Highly respected by both of the Knight World's Households, Jakobus was able to broker a fragile ceasefire between the Imperium and Kragh, before a trio of Tech-Adepts nearly shattered it. The Tech-Adepts had discovered an STC archeotech upon Kragh, which had allowed its Knight Houses to keep their Knight suits in remarkable condition, and were caught trying to take the priceless STC to Mars. Luckily however, their transgressions did not bring Kragh's Knight Houses and the Imperium into hostility once again.
Malodrax	Malodrax is a Fortress World belonging to the Iron Warriors Chaos Space Marines under Warsmith Shon'tu, notable for being the location of Imperial Fist Captain Darnath Lysander's imprisonment and torture. When Lysander escaped the planet he returned with reinforcements, ravaging the planet in an act of vengeance. Later with the help of Ork allies, Shon'tu built a new powerbase upon the planet. However, the planet was completely destroyed by the Phalanx in the Fall of Malodrax.
Betalis III	Betalis III is an Ice World and Mining World of the Imperium most famous for its invasion by Eldar forces in 894.M41. Originally discovered in the Omniel Crusade, an Adeptus Mechanicus Explorator craft came across the world while recovering an Eldar craft that had landed on the planet. Scoured by the Ordo Xenos and Adeptus Mechanicus afterwards, after many decades the scans were complete and no further Eldar presence could be found. Concluding that the craft had been abandoned, the Inquisition lost interest in Betalis III and it quickly developed into an ore and mineral mining outpost for the Imperium. Its extreme climate made it uninhabitable and thus little development occurred, its only major population consisted of tens of millions of settlers shipped in to serve as miners or factory laborers. The planets climate meant the planetary population was forced to live in confined quarters for generations on end, leading to madness, claustrophobia, and agoraphobia.[1a] In 894.M41 Eldar forces from Craftworld Alaitoc, Craftworld Mymeara, and Corsairs from the Void Dragons, Sky Raiders, and Sunblitz Brotherhood descended upon Betalis III in search of Irillyth, the lost Phoenix Lord of the Shadow Spectres Aspect Warriors. Betalis III was reinforced by Cadian and Elysian Imperial Guard as well as Titans from the Legio Gryphonicus and Space Wolves Space Marines.[1b] After fighting the Eldar to a bloody standstill, the mysterious aliens vanished as quickly as they had arrived, presumably recovering Irillyth.[1c]
Ardenz IV	Ardenz IV is a world ruled by the Heretic despot, Raceen D'Uborll. Imperial forces have made an attempt to kill Raceen, but the attack ended in failure, due to the Heretic's use of a Force Field.
Rook	Rook is an Imperial world. In 913.M41, an abandoned Rhino of the 7th Company of the Lamenters Chapter was found — five years after this Chapter had sided with the Secessionists during the Badab War.
Iax	Iax, also known as the "Garden of Ultramar", is a planet in the stellar realm of Ultramar. Iax was an Agri World whose climate and fertility has made it one of the most productive worlds in the Imperium. There were no large cities on Iax, its land given over to producing quality food. The oldest and most urbanised area is the ancient fortress city of First Landing, its tall citadel withstanding the barrages of invaders over the centuries. By the end of the Great Crusade, Iax was regarded as one of the most important worlds of Ultramar, on the same levels as Macragge, Konor, Occluda and Saramanth.[7a] Such was its standing that it was the domain of one of the Tetrarchs of Ultramar.[7b]
Ultra Mundanus	Ultra Mundanus is a world located in Ultima Segmentum.
Jago	Jago is an ancient Fortress World that was assaulted by the Imperial Guard in 778.M41, during the Sabbat Worlds Crusade. Formerly held completely by warriors of the Blood Pact, the Guard drove the enemy to a standstill. Jago's terrain is mostly flat desert with massive mountain ranges dividing the planet. Trenches, partially filled in by millennium of dust storms, cover the landscape. Barracks, trenches, pillboxes and fortifications, far too large to have ever been built by Humans or any of the known xenos, pattern the entire planet, towering far above and far below the surface.
Kamenka Troika	The Kamenka Troika is the collective name for the three satellite worlds of the planet Kamenka Ulizarna, an Adeptus Mechanicus fiefdom. The Troika is mentioned in Imperial records as being freed of a Greenskin infestation during the middle years of the Great Crusade. The Imperial forces tasked with exterminating the xenos breed were the Thousand Sons Legiones Astartes, Legio Astorum of the Titan Legions and a unit of the PanPac Eugenians of the Imperial Army. This tasking was issued by the Emperor himself, and proved a difficult one for all involved. The campaign took two years to complete and caused significant Imperial casualties, including almost an entire Fellowship of the Thousand Sons and also the entirety of the Legio Astorum forces. The aftermath of the campaign is significant in two ways. First of all, the Thousand Sons decided to honour Legio Astorum by recovering the wreck of the last Astorum Titan to fall, Canis Vertex, repairing and transporting her to Prospero to mount upon the pyramid of the Pyrae Cult. Canis Vertex would walk once more about a century later, during the Burning of Prospero. Secondly, the loss of one of their Fellowships was never made good; Magnus the Red decided that the reduction of his legion from ten elements to nine was a significant moment, and the legion was reorganised into the Pesedjet as a result.
Nekkar	Nekkar is a Forge World of the Imperium, formerly held by the Word Bearers. In their pursuit of the Word Bearers Chaos Lord Zymran, Captain Kruger's Ultramarines Company assaulted the Forge World Nekkar, which had been under the control of Zymran's Word Bearers forces. Striking at their fortress stronghold, the Ultramarines purged the Chaos Space Marines from the Forge World, breaking their hold on Nekkar and returning it to the Imperium.
Oldarian	Oldarian is a world of the Imperium and was the site of the massacre of Battlefleet Aquinas, by Huron Blackheart and his Red Corsairs. Huron Blackheart led a large force of the Corsairs in attacking the Battlefleet as they were still mustering above the planet. With the Battlefleet caught off guard, the Corsairs manged to destroy a number of the Battlefleet's ships before they could regroup and return fire. Despite the Battlefleet's counter attack, the end of the battle came when the Corsairs' Strike Cruiser the Wolf of Fenris, launched boarding torpedoes into the Battleship the Chosen of Thor. From the torpedoes emerged Huron himself, who led the Corsairs in a boarding attack that destroyed the Chosen of Thor's reactors, taking the powerful ship out of the battle. With the Chosen of Thor gone, the rest of the Battlefleet soon fell under the Corsairs' fire, though some ships managed to flee the massacre. Many feel they were allowed to live, however, in order to bring word of Huron's personal message to the rest of the Imperium - "Your Empire is dead".
Fall of Malodrax	The Fall of Malodrax was a battle between loyalist Space Marines and Iron Warriors forces under Warsmith Shon'tu and his Ork allies in 971.M41. In the aftermath of the Infestation on Drashin which saw the death of Imperial Fists Chapter Master Vladimir Pugh, it became apparent that the entire battle was engineered by the hated enemy of the Imperial Fists, Iron Warriors Warsmith Shon'tu. In the aftermath of the revelation the Imperial Fists decided to seek vengeance against Shon'tu, deploying the might of the chapter against his world of Malodrax. The Phalanx itself led the attack, commanded by newly appointed Chapter Master Vorn Hagen. The Imperial Fists were joined by the Ultramarines Cruiser Valin's Revenge and three Blood Angels Azkaellon Class Frigates under Tycho. The Iron Warriors defenders were joined by Ork allies who Shon'tu had previously armed in exchange for slaves. The largest craft in the traitors fleet was Shon'tu's own flagship, the ancient War Barque Tamunash. The Phalanx and Tamunash began to exchange fire with one another, and it became apparent that the Daemonic vessel could regenerate damage it sustained by using umbilical-like cords connected to the surface of Malodrax where a vat of souls powered its repair. The Imperial Fists thus realized they would have to assault Malodrax itself before winning the space battle. Tor Garadon would lead forces on Boarding Torpedoes to assault the Tamunash while Lysander's 1st Company would remain in reserve, ready to deploy wherever needed. However Shon'tu was able to use Psykers to stir the Warp to interfere with the communications of Astartes onboard the vessel. Using this to their advantage, the traitors and Orks launched a fierce counterattack against the Imperial Fists with not only infantry but also hulking Helbrutes and Maulerfiends. Garadon used Epistolary Darsway to guide him through the vessel amid the carnage.
Sundamar	Sundamar was the site of a battle between the Eldar and the Death Watch.
Muiral'lathar	Muiral'lathar is an Eldar Maiden World, that has become the site of a battle between the Black Legion and the forces of Craftworld Biel-Tan. A side effect of the fighting is that Muiral'lathar's natural flora has been able to spread once more.
Festus (World)	Festus is an Imperial Feudal World in the Calixis Sector.
Melchior	Melchior is a planet which was conquered by the Imperium during the Great Crusade. The planet Melchior was founded by the Imperium during the Great Crusade era. At the time the human population on the planet had been consumed by the Nephilim Xenos race. Eventually the Blood Angels and Luna Wolves Space Marine Legions were able to defeat the Nephilim. The current status of the planet is unknown.
Preyspire	Preyspire is the homeworld of the Hawk Lords Space Marine Chapter.
Malvolion	Malvolion was an Agri World destroyed by the Tyranids in 992.M41. Malvolion's inhabitants discovered a Tyranid beacon on their planet and sent for aid from the Imperial Guard, who arrived in the form of the 15th Mordian Iron Guard, several Phyrus regiments (including the 4th) and a Paladian tank regiment. They could not, however, save the planet. Even as the evacuation was underway, a sudden outbreak of Genestealers and Lictors sent the planet into a panic before, only minutes later, a full scale invasion was taking place. Even the belated intervention of the Lamenters Space Marines was not nearly enough to stop the plague, and the barren world now stands as yet another symbol of the Great Devourer and its mighty fleets.
Paraghast	Paraghast is a Hive World of the Imperium. In 904.M41, the forces of Chaos transformed the principal city of Partihive into a nightmare. Becoming a twisted prison of billions of souls, the Hive itself transformed into a creature whose 'roots' burrowed into the surrounding ground for hundreds of miles in each direction. The hive-creature would expand, assaulting the Paraghast PDF even as they battled Nurglite and Slaaneshi Daemons.
Saint Lykon's Repose	Saint Lykon's Repose is a holy Imperial Shrine World. None but the Imperium's elite are allowed to set foot amongst its continent-sized shrine gardens and idyllic - if heavily defended - contemplariums. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Targus VIII	Targus VIII is a world occupied by the Imperium but formerly controlled by Orks (and previously the Imperium) on the fringes of the Halo Stars in the galactic south. On this world Kayvaan Shrike made his name during Waaagh! Skullkrak, fighting behind Ork lines in order to destroy a large orbital gun. When his mission was complete, a Thunderhawk was dispatched to retrieve him and his squad, but was shot down en-route. Shrike and his forces remained behind Ork lines for the next two years, providing targeting information of Ork positions, fuel dumps and vehicle parks before they retreated back into a ruined hive. As of M42, Targus VIII still has an Ork infestation and the Xenos have settlements there. One was ruled by a Beastboss, who became particularly troublesome for the world. This later led a small Raven Guard strike force to be dispatched to Targus VIII, with orders to kill the Beastboss.
But Dust in the Wind (Short Story)	Investigating a distress signal from an ice-shrouded mining colony, Space Marines of the Imperial Fists find themselves outnumbered and surrounded by the soulless necrons. Facing impossible odds, the Imperial Fists struggle desperately to find a way to survive.
Arkalli	Arkalli is an Imperial Desert World. Arkalli is at the centre of a group of Imperial worlds at the very edge of the reach of the Astronomican. The world is mostly covered in deserts, though there are sparse seas and equatorial jungles. The seas are noted as being smaller than the remnants of seas on Holy Terra. The population of the world are mostly scavengers and members of the Cult Mechanicus who work in the large underground factories. Sometime in the 41st Millenium, the Helion Legion combatted Orks and the forces of Nurgle on the planet.
Oestragon III	Oestragon III is a world of the Imperium. A Cult uprising on the planet was destroyed by the Ibrogan Guard regiments of the Astra Militarum.
Laius Rift	This article is based on information Games Workshop Australia/New Zealand created on their own behalf and may conflict with more general background material. Laius Rift is an icy Death World. Laius Rift's surface is almost totally covered in glaciers and permanently scoured by deadly blizzards and other extreme climatic phenomena. Archaeological records indicate that the planet's orbit was once significantly closer to its star, which explains its lack of well-developed flora and fauna. Due to its Oxygen/Nitrogen atmosphere, Laius Rift was once host to significant mining operations, all of which ended in 841.M41. Laius Rift's Aestimare is B30.[1b]
First Sphere of Expansion	The First Sphere of Expansion, also known as the Great Expansion, was the initial expansion of the T'au Empire from their homeworld of T'au and was a period of unprecedented growth for the Empire. It lasted from 502.M37 to 956.M38.[1a][1b] The First Sphere of Expansion was launched from T'au and lasted roughly a millennium for the T'au. It saw seven additional fully settled Septs: Tau'n, D'yanoi, Bork'an, Dal'yth, Fal'shia, Vior'la, and Sa'cea. The Poctroon were the first race to join the T'au Empire during this period, though they were later wiped out by disease. Later, the Nicassar became the first race to join and endure. The T'au encountered the Orks for the first time during this period[1b] and tried to negotiate with them but after the massacre of the delegates on Kor'voss and Vaslan Prime[2b], the Water Caste abandoned these attempts and T'au fought with the greenskins thereafter.[2a] The situation changed in favour of the T'au only after the Campaign of Cleansing.[1b] Also at this period the Thraxian race was assimilated.[2a] This was a terrific period of T'au growth that saw a massive population boom and unprecedented growth. The phase only came to an end because sparse T'au numbers could not keep up with their rapid advance and due to the sheer distance between systems that made crossing the span of the Empire impossible in a single lifetime. At the end of the Second Sphere of Expansion, the T'au encountered the Kroot, which eventually led to the T'au war effort to liberate them from the Orks in what culminated in the War in the Place of Union. For the next ten years, the T'au helped the Kroot drive the Orks from their worlds, eventually liberating their homeworld of Pech at the behest of the greatest Kroot leader Anghkor Prok.[1a] During the intermission between the First and Second Spheres of Expansion, the Anthrazods and Brachyura were integrated into the Empire and helped prepare the T'au for the next war. However, the key to further T'au expansion came from the Sept of Fal'shia, where they finalised development of the ZFR Horizon Accelerator Engine. This finally allowed the T'au to attain near-light speed travel and launch the Second Sphere of Expansion.[1a]
Pyrites	Pyrites is a world of the Imperium. It was used as an rest and recreation base for Imperial Guard Regiments during the Sabbat Worlds Crusade, including, for a time, the Tanith 1st. The capital city of Pyrites was known as Cracia City and was most distinguishable by a structure known as the Imperial Needle, a 3,000 metre iron tower raised to glorify both the Emperor and the engineering skills of Pyritean metalworkers. Black ironwork featured heavily in most local architecture, with most of Cracia City's grey buildings featuring some form of it. As the capital, Cracia City possessed an Adeptus Arbites Precinct House and an Ecclesiarchy Cathedral. A notable feature of Cracian street design was that they were heavily environmentally controlled. A cold world in winter, underground heating systems would blow warm air up into the streets and rudimentary force fields were generated at the first story levels of buildings so that rain and snow would not make the streets unpleasant for pedestrians. However, not all streets possessed this technology and these so-called "cold zones" were considered unsafe and even lawless areas in contrast to the comfort and order of the heated streets.
Heshimar	Heshimar was an Imperium world, who declared their alliegance to the traitorous Warmaster Horus, during the Horus Heresy. Near the end of the Heresy, the World Eaters Legion's flagship Conqueror exited the Warp near Heshimar, as it was making its journey to take part in the invasion of Terra. By that time, the Conqueror had fallen under the influence of Khorne, which had led the flagship to become a hostile environment to those aboard it. This led to the rapid depletion of supplies and manpower, but the population of Heshimar gladly offered to give the Conqueror whatever it needed to fully resupply. The crew of the Conqueror noted, however, that Heshimar was a resource poor world and to fully restore the flagship's supplies would leave the world barren. This did not matter to the Conqueror's Captain, Lotara Sarrin, and she gave the order to take by force what was needed for them to reach Terra. A week later the Conqueror reentered the Warp, with its holds filled with food, water, fuel and tens of thousands of slaves. Heshimar, meanwhile, was now a silent, pockmarked world, whose cities had been reduced to slag.
Haddrack	Haddrack is a Death World and a Forge World in the Calixis Sector. It is home to an Adeptus Mechanicus Explorator Base of the Sollex Admech Sect.
Simia Orichalcae	Simia Orichalcae is an Ice World of the Imperium, uninhabited except for Promethium processing plants scattered across the planet to refine deep underground veins of rare ice into usable promethium. The origins of the planet's name remains unknown. After some research, the most plausible theory that Inquisitor Amberley Vail could produce was that, it refers to a statue or effigy in a past epoch, but the importance of commemorating the genus Simia remains unknown.[1a] It is, however, most notably featured as the planet where Commissar Ciaphas Cain along with the Valhallan 597th were deployed to defend a promethium refinery against marauding bands of Orks[1b], and later encountering Necrons released from stasis by the presence of sentient life.[1c] It was later speculated that high-ranking Magi of the Adeptus Mechanicus, had deliberately built the refinery above the Necron Tomb, in order to investigate it.[1d]
Nostramo	Nostramo was the homeworld of the Night Lords Space Marine Legion until Night Haunter destroyed it. Nostramo, on the inside edge of the Ghoul Stars, was a planet of perpetual darkness, covered in clouds of pollution and a perpetual solar eclipse. Only the planetary elite could afford artificial illumination. Murder, extortion, and theft were rampant, while the elite oppressed the vast underclass of foundry workers with hired thugs, the closest approximation the planet had to law enforcement. Violence, both interpersonal and suicide, kept the population in check. Nostramo's geology contained priceless wealth, particularly huge quantities of naturally occurring adamantium. The mineral trade made Nostramo great amounts of wealth, but at the cost of vast chemical and metalworking facilities scarring the landscape, throwing up the toxic clouds that perpetually darkened the skies.
Zhao-Arkkad	Zhao-Arkkad is a Forge World of the Imperium. It is one of the Mechanicum's most far-flung and isolated Forges. It has only recently been re-consecrated, and the Forge World's Techpriests are noted to be the possessors of the STC template that allows for the production of the Praetor Armoured Assault Launcher. Zhao-Arkkad was settled in the late days of the Dark Age of Technology by a Martian expedition, perhaps accidentally from a fleet blown off course in the Warp. The atmosphere was highly toxic and the planet's surface filled with heavily canopied rain forests, but nonetheless the human settlers managed to colonize the world. Titans accompanying the settlers defended them from the beasts of the planet, eventually becoming the Legio Xestobiax. In the First Conjunction, Zhao-Arkkad managed to become mostly self-sufficient and functional Forge World. In the Second Conjunction, Zhao-Arkkad's three moons were colonized. Soon Zhao-Arkkad managed to expand further, establishing several outlying planetary outposts.
Areadnnil	Areadnnil is an Eldar Exodite World.
Rand XXI	Rand XXI is a Desert World held by the Adepta Sororitas and is the location of the priory fortress, the Imperator Deus.
Sulo	Sulo is a Frontier World located in the Eastern Fringe. Lord Messarian was the ruler of the planet Sulo who had ambitions of building an Empire in the Eastern Fringe. By manipulating records to make it appear that the planet's crops were poor and its workshops idle, he had a pretence to withhold his tithes from the Imperium. He used this to increase the size of his own forces and allied himself with renegades from the Famir system to build up his power base. Andrukas was Marshal of Court for the Adeptus Arbites on Sulo. Described as a tall, grey and unbending man, he enforced the Lex Imperialis from his fortified Courthouse with one hundred Arbitrators. Andrukas knew that Messarian was falsifying his records and withholding his tithes, and had seen firsthand the military buildup. When he captured Famir renegades raiding in the system, he realised the extent of Messarian's crimes. He sent an astropathic communication to the Judges but had no way of knowing how long it would be before he could expect reinforcements.
Heletine	A Cardinal World, Heletine features large population centres and industrial sectors with a profusion of significant religious or cultural sites that dot the landscape. Heletine is an old world, which was founded sometime during the Great Crusade, survived the following Horus Heresy and lasted up until the 41st Millennium.[1c] Sometime prior to this period, after uncounted centuries of industrial exploitation by a series of tyrants, the Ecclesiarchy reclaimed the world raising vast temples, unearthing lost tombs, interring new relics and forming reliquaries.[1d] As Cardinal World[1b], Heletine is average in most respects, with a centre of industry at Solist and a vast population centre at Canticus. However, its true purpose lies in Heletine's piety. Its surface is dotted with significant religious structures or temples whilst even in the vast population centre of Canticus, the labyrinthine streets are crowded with colonnaded temples and minor shrine-holds.[1a] As such, Heletine now forms part of the Ecclesiarchy's protectorate.[1b] In 980.M41, Heletine was embroiled in planetary scale war that encompassed many of its major locations. This 'Promethean War' saw the Salamanders 6th Company lead by Captain Ur'zan Drakgaard and Chaplain Elysius fighting alongside many Cadian regiments, such as the Cadian 81st, and the Adeptus Sororitas of the Order of the Ebon Chalice, against the traitors of the Black Legion.[1a] As such, much of the world's once glorious architecture has now been mercilessly ravaged by the war. The Black Legion's motives were not entirely certain, but what is clear is that they waged war in an almost nomadic style, moving from relic site to relic site and despoiling each in turn. It was theorised by Captain Drakgaard, Chaplain Elysius and Canoness Angerer that they sought to perform some sort of ritual involving the destruction of the relics and the resultant weakening of the Imperial faith.[1d] Despite the best efforts of the Imperial forces to break the Black Legion, they remained embroiled in a grave war of attrition that saw both sides suffer grievous casualties. In an attempt to force the Black Legion from it's main stronghold, the Salamanders and the remaining units of the Cadian 81st launched an assault to break the Black Legion's hold on Canticus and use it as a stepping stone to liberate the rest of Heletine. Expecting pre-arranged reinforcements from the entirety of the deployed Sisters of Battle war-host, the assault force was ambushed and repelled with great losses to the Salamanders and their Cadian allies. Only timely intervention by a small force of Seraphim (Who had disobeyed Canoness Angerer's orders to abandon the Imperial strike force and instead reinforce her in following an ulterior motive[1f]), saved the remaining Imperial forces from an outright massacre.
Scelus	Scelus is a world near the Eye of Terror in the Cadian Sector within the Segmentum Obscurus. It was the homeworld of the Sons of Malice Space Marine Chapter before they were excommunicated. A group of feral tribes were the original inhabitants of Scelus and the barbarous, cannibalistic rituals that the Sons of Malice were excommunicated for originated from these tribes. These tribes were almost entirely eradicated by the Cadian 331st in a planet-wide campaign of genocide performed after the Sons of Malice fled into the Eye of Terror. Scelus contained a Schola Progenium, that was subject to a raid by by the Iron Warriors.
Kromlok	Kromlok is home to the Kromlok Dangler, a Tyranid variant found only on the world's mountainous regions.
Iolas IX	Iolas IX is a world that was attacked by Tyranid forces. The planet was defended by 267th Cadian Regiment.
Voss Prime	Voss Prime, known as the Right Hand of Mars, is a Forge World and the closest such world to Armageddon. It is the homeworld of the Legio Invigilata. Voss Prime was founded during the Dark Age of Technology but was reunited with Mars following a lull in Warp Storms during the Age of Strife. Thus at the time of the Great Crusade, the new Imperium found a thriving and rich world and Voss Prime has continued to churn out massive levels of armaments and technology for Mankind. Much of their wealth can be attributed to the Mordan Belt, an asteroid belt rich in resources that also has proven to be a useful defence for the planet. Nonetheless Voss has some weaknesses: namely, it has proven unable to master plasma technology as well as other Forge Worlds have. It has not requested any aid in this deficiency, and none has been offered. Voss’ low orbit is full of circling slab-like rectangles made from solid adamantine, ready to be installed onto ships constructed at the forge world due to the peculiar design variations of Voss pattern ships.
Asur	Asur is a barren an was discovered by the Imperium in M37.
ples after the Fall of the Eldar, it was named Asur in honor of its claimant. It was the site of the first Aspect Warrior Shrine and the Asurya were trained on the world. It was located in a pocket-realm of the webway.[3a]
Pax	Pax is the fifth planet of the Modren's Realm System. Pax is a gas giant with twenty-six moons in its gravitational pull. Though Vir Modren has established colonies on several of the largest moons, the most notable feature of Pax is an orbiting, artificial construct of unknown and ancient provenance. Over five kilometres across, it was found in much better condition than any ancient ruins on other planets of this system. It cannot provide condition for service or life aboard, though outcast Tech-Priests in Modren’s service were unable to determine if the station had ever been equipped to support life, or if its mechanical systems had been lost or stolen during the time of its existing. Exploring the Pax orbital, Modren’s tech-adepts have installed above the main hull of the object entire new sections. Now it is consists of many kilometres of halls and corridors, intersecting with large docking arms, cargo holds, training facilities and other compartments. The exterior of the station is studded with macro-cannons and turrets, some of which are installed into ancient stonework domes, the original purpose of which is unknown.
Terminator	Some text passages and/or images of this article have been removed due to insufficient Citations and placed under Quarantine on this article's Discussion page until proper citations have been provided. You can help to restore them to the article by finding the correct citations and re-integrating the quarantined text and/or images as described in the Help article on citations. Terminators per se is a term normally used to refer to Space Marine Veterans wearing powerful Tactical Dreadnought Armour, more commonly referred to as Terminator Armour. In most Codex Chapters, they are members of the elite 1st Company of a Space Marine Chapter. Others can wear Terminator Armour as well, even in a Codex-compliant chapter, such as Librarians (who do not belong to a company), and other exceptions exist as well, such as in the Inquisition, but these are not typically referred to as "Terminators". Within a typical Space Marine Chapter, only the members of the 1st Company have full access to the rare and extremely resilient Terminator Armour. Each suit is treated as an important relic and seen as a physical representation of the Chapter's fighting spirit.
Amun'an Morrus	Amun'an Morrus is a forbidden Dead World of the Calixis Sector. During the Angevin Crusade, Amun'an Morrus' once-human machine population was judged too tainted to exist and was infamously destroyed by Exterminatus. Such horrors were attested to on this world that after its destruction its former location was stricken from all records, only to live on as a dark legend.
Tarren IV	During the attempted relif of Brandstat on Tarren IV Emperor's Children deployed supported by Castellan and Colossus Robots.
Faeden's Reach	Faeden's Reach was the site of a battle for the forces from the Tau Empire's Bork'an Sept World.
Halanga	Halanga is a Desert World that contains Webway Portals. These were used by the Craftworld Ulthwe to enter the world in M42, where they began to scheme against the Imperium. However this was discovered by the Adeptus Custodes and Captain-General Valoris personally led its forces to Halanga and destroyed the Xenos.
Phaeton	Phaeton is a Forge World of the Imperium.[1a] Phaeton is the originator of a common pattern of Leman Russ Battle Tank[1a], a Chimera variant with Heavy Flamers, a rebreather variant, and several other variant equipment patterns. In addition, it is the homeworld of the Legio Osedax (Cockatrices). It is located close to the Civilised World of Tahnel. During the Age of Strife, Phaeton was forced to fight against many grave threats and barely survived.

Upon reunion with the Imperium, they gained fame for their fury during the Great Crusade.
The Siege of Helios	In 857.M38 the Red Scorpions Chapter delivered the manufactory world of Helios from a massive Ork invasion of Waaagh! Grimgut. It is on this planet and in this conflict the Red Scorpions first developed the Land Raider Helios by putting the Whirlwind's rocket launcher on their Land Raiders. Orks of Grimgut using the low cunning sent force an infestation of Bomb Squigs and destroyed every vehicle attempted to press through city's streets. Then one of the Archmagos of Hive Manufactory 33 Delta Thule, from the ordnance foundry supplied missile launchers to Red Scorpions claimed that he received a vision from the Machine God himself. In this vision he have seen that if the rocket launcher would be fitting the Chapter's Land Raiders. they could able to mount the artillery support and would be immune themselves from the most concentrated efforts to overwhelm them, so soon the hive and all of Helios would be delivered. Red Scorpions agreed with him and started to make preparations. In the resulting battle the dozen converted Heluos pattern Land Raiders strike force deep into the Ork-held hive. As before, tides of Bomb Squigs erupted from the sewers to break against the vehicles. After the mighty explosions the Land Raiders stand charred black and spattered in Squig's blood but otherwise intact, while the Orkoid beasts obliterated itself to no effect whatsoever. Now the path to the infested ork's hive was open and the Grimgut was doomed. For returning the planet and its resources to the Adeptus Mechanicus, the Helios pattern missile launcher was prioritized for the Chapter's use. Helios would be assaulted by the barbarous Greenskins on numerous subsequent occasions, and each time the Red Scorpions would answer its call for aid. The Red Scorpions themselves disseminated the new pattern of Land Raider to small number of Chapters it has close relations with.
Solemnace	Solemnace is a Necron Tomb World located in the Eastern Fringe. Solemnace is a Tomb World ruled by Trazyn the Infinite[7a], an Overlord of the Nihilakh Dynasty. Its galleries are famous for displaying some of the greatest artifacts and technological wonders in the galaxy and have been visited by Necrons of almost every dynasty before the Great Sleep.[7b] The planet itself is an artificial construct, essentially a planet-sized Dyson Sphere whose outer shell consists of untold amounts of nano-machines. A series of "mirrors" exist above the planet which collect Solemnace's excess energy and redirect it back to form an artificial sun and atmosphere. Beneath the outer nano-shell are vast prismatic galleries, where Trazyn's many collections exist in suspended animation.[5a] The Tomb World is also known to contain one of the greatest document collection in the galaxy, such is his size that even rivals the Black Library of the Aeldari.[7b] So vast are the maze-like galleries and passageways on Solemnace that not even Trazyn knows their true extent, for the construction Scarabs have endlessly expanded it for millennia. Most of these galleries are simply empty, awaiting the day Trazyn may utilize them for the display of something.[7a]

This changed sometime after the creation of the Great Rift, when a group of Ogryn killed a mutant beast that had been roaming the world's jungle. The Ogryn then discovered an undulating sac within the mutant's remains and, after becoming fascinated with the sac, they decided to take it back to their village. Once in the village, the sac eventually opened and a radiant creature emerged from it. To the village's Ogryns, the creature resembled a perfectly formed Human and they wept in the presence of its magnificence. The Ogryn then all fell to their knees in worship of it and their own bodies began to change, to become more like the creature they now adored. Months later, Imperial Guard fleets arrived to collect their tithe of soldiers from Krachordia, but found no trace of the Ogryn tribes. Instead they discovered a world that been completely overrun with hulking Chaos Spawns.
Gnosis Prime	Gnosis Prime is an Imperial industrial world. Settled in M40, Gnosis Prime was known for its large industrial complexes,[1a] until it was invaded and all but depopulated by Eldar in M41.[2a] Gnosis Prime was the main world of the Gnosis system, orbiting the star Gnosis Aurora. The planet served as the main industrial hub of the entire Talhor Sector, its fifty billion citizens toiling in expansive manufactora whose choking pollution left the planet's atmosphere and oceans toxic. As a result, sustenance for the population was farmed on the nearby moon Gnosis Secundus, nutritious plant mulch farmed by workers who dreamt of one day visiting Prime's vast hives.[2a] At some point prior to 764.M34, Gnosis came under attack from Chaos Space Marines of the World Eaters Traitor Legion led by Angron as well as forces of the Third Legion including Fabius Bile.

Located in the furthest reaches of Ultima Segmentum, in the Eastern Fringes, this forge world has grown autonomous through long periods of isolation. The Tech-Priests of Triplex Phall have discovered many pockets of worlds on the outskirts of the galaxy settled during the Dark Age of Technology. Many of these lost colonies were Knight worlds and some of them yielded technological secrets such as caches of STC designs, or unique archeotech. While the star system was first established on Galatia during the early exploration of the galaxy[4c], by the time of the Horus Heresy Triplex Phall was part of a local empire alongside its two other sister planets, Galatia and Thule. Triplex Phall would prove to be the largest forgeworld of the triplets when the Emperor arrived, and provided its Titan Legion to the Great Crusade while Galatia and Thule's smaller Legions were left for local protection[4c]. All three were the site of heavy fighting in the Thramas Crusade during the Horus Heresy, where they resisted the Night Lords and fratricidal combat between the triple worlds' Mechanicum magi.[4a][4c] Triplex Phall's Tech-Priests initially turned to Horus' side at the beginning of the Heresy,[4c] but following the destruction of Galatia by the Dark Angels many of the traitors on Phall fled rather than face Lion El'Jonson's wrath. Loyalist Mechanicum elements launched an uprising and handed the planet over to the Dark Angels.[4b] Triplex Phall was the only world of the Triplex to survive the Heresy.[4c]

Their goal was then to clear the Eldar vast southern flank for the armies of the Emperor to sweep away the Xenos host. As Seth travelled in a formation of his Chapter's Stormravens to attack the Eldar, though, the Chapter Master spotted the Saim-Hann Autarch who was leading the attack.

The gunship dodged enemy anti-air fire and delivered Seth near the Autarch, who was easily killed by the Flesh Tearers' Chapter Master.
Lightning	The Lightning fighter craft is mainly used by the Imperial Navy for establishing air superiority due to its increased maneuverability over the Thunderbolt. It is often seen and heard plummeting from orbit or being scrambled from naval bases.[1a] The Lightning is also used by the forces of Chaos. Lost during the Scouring, the STC data for the Lightning was rediscovered during the Saint-Saen Crusade, which liberated twelve worlds in Segmentum Obscurus. They were found on Karnak II by an Adeptus Mechanicus Explorator team and the designs immediately given to the Mechanicus Lords of Cypra Mundi. It would take over five hundred years of research and trials, including readings of the Emperor's Tarot and cross-referencing with the archives of Mars, before the designs were finally approved for production in supplying fleet carriers and cruisers of Battlefleet Obscurus. Since then the designs have slowly been disseminated to the Navy worlds of Bakka and Hydraphur and Lightnings are now commonly seen alongside the Thunderbolt in both Segmentum Tempestus and Segmentum Pacificus.[1a] Lightning squadrons are not fixed in size, but most feature more than two dozen aircrafts at the start of hostilities. They will inevitably suffer heavy attrition, only to be reinforced by fresh pilots.

Cyclonic torpedo	Cyclonic torpedoes are a category of torpedo utilized by the Imperium for orbital bombardment of a planet once Exterminatus has been invoked. A wide variety of weapons fit the definition of cyclonic torpedoes, and employ varying means of scouring the world's surface, from nucleonic fire to raw plasma, or even deadly radiation.[4a] The nucleonic fires are sustained by an arcane process known only to high ranking Mechanicus tech-priests, converting raw matter into energy until the entire planet is engulfed by a raging inferno.[4b] Whatever their method of destruction, the effect of cyclonic torpedoes is the same: the complete destruction of all life on the planet, its atmosphere burned away in a storm of fire and its oceans boiled to vapour, leaving it a barren rock. The only factions within the Imperium known to have these weapons are the Inquisition and the Adeptus Astartes. Sources conflict on to what extent the Space Marines have the authority to declare Exterminatus without the assent of an Inquisitor, but agree that Inquisitors have the authority on their own recognizance.[Needs Citation]

However, this all changed when a thousand hidden Tzeentch Cults on the world made their presence known. In that moment, Chianco would become known as the World that Died in One Night, as millions of Tzeentch cultists wreaked havoc on its surface and tore down both its civilization and infrastructure, leaving it a devastated wasteland. Fifty years later, Chianco is now a Feral World where barbarians live out a rough existence amongst its ruins and the sight of a single ship is extremely rare.

The bodies, or even parts of them, of several saints are believed to reside within them and are guarded by a detachment of Battle Sisters. Due to its nature, the planet is often visited by Inquisitors to subscribe to the Thorian belief and it was the actions of one of these that led to a rift between the Inquisition and the Ecclesiarchy which has yet to be closed. Containing deep catacombs with the remains of many Saints as well as ancient religious tomes, the planet became the center of the Gallilenus Heresy.

Macharius (Character)	No, he was not a saint. He was a man. A very great man, and in some ways, a very wicked one. Lord Commander Solar Macharius (356-400.M41) is widely regarded as the greatest Imperial Guard commander in Imperial history. His conquests, known as the Macharian Crusade, beginning in 392.M41, reached the edge of galactic space, and brought nearly a thousand worlds under Imperial control within only seven years of fighting. He was one of the greatest Living Saints in Imperial history and is considered the greatest Saint of the Imperial Guard. Macharius rose to prominence in the early Forty-First Millennium during a time when the Imperium's power was finally recovering from the devastating Age of Apostasy. Born in 356.M41 as the heir of the Planetary Governor of Donia, Pella, Macharius was already a renowned Imperial Guard General by his early 20s. His brilliant leadership during the crushing of the Roxane Rebellion, where he rescued Lord Commander Solar Phillips, brought Macharius to the attention of the High Lords of Terra. Phillips recognized the genius of Macharius and took him under his wing, naming him his successor as Lord Commander Solar. It was also during this time that Macharius met the men who would go on to lead his armies: Sejanus, Borgen Crassus, Tarka, Arrian, Lysander of Choripoli, and Cyrus of Larrentine. In 386.M41 Lord Solar Phillips was killed in the Lemort Landings and Macharius inherited his prestigious command, the youngest in the history of the position. He traveled to Terra for the first and last time during his inauguration. Using his new position, he oversaw a string of early conquests on the worlds of Lands End, Morbellum, and Jalfrezi III with his Donian Army. It was at this point that Macharius expressed his desire to launch the greatest Crusade since the Great Crusade at the dawn of the Imperium itself.
Uolesh	Uolesh is a Daemon World in the Eye of Terror. Uolesh is plunged into perpetual night and is a sprawling graveyard whose ground is composed of a mosaic of living corpses that constantly writhe and scream. Each of these bodies was once a man, and each of them made a pact with the Chaos Gods, motivated by jealously and spite. They are filled with thoughts of envy and hatred for those that remain unsullied and pure, and those that traverse this vile carpet of rotting flesh have to constantly fight the hands and claws that try to grab them and drag them into Uolesh's filth. It is said that when the Lord of Uolesh manifests in the material world, a writhing tide of corpses bursts through with him, intent on sharing their fate with anyone they find.
Subsector Aurelia	Subsector Aurelia is a cluster of worlds in the Korianis sector of the Segmentum Ultima, which stands on the edge of the Imperium of Man.

Gulgorahd Protectorate	The Gulgorahd Protectorate is an Imperial Sector on the edge of the Ultima Segmentum. During the Horus Heresy, it was used to create a buffer zone between the traitor strongholds of the Nostramo and Thramas Sectors and the rest of the Imperium. During the Dark Age of Technology, this region was one of the thriving centres of Humanity. However, thanks to the Age of Strife, little of that glory survived the millennia. Battered and broken by endless waves of xenos invasions and human renegades, its people had taken refuge in grim strongholds and made war the sole focus of their industry. Though they survived Old Night, they became isolationist and distrustful, and envious of the wealth of Triplex and Terra, a people brought into the Imperium only through struggle. At the outbreak of the Horus Heresy Gulgorahd hatefully sought to gain the upper hand against the Triplex, which led it to turn to the loyalists in the Thramas Crusade.
Cinchare	Chinchare, also known as Cinchare is an asteroid locked in a figure-eight orbit around a binary star. It is the fourth planet of the Chinchare System. Its strange orbital pattern and the close proximity to another star system (Pymbyle) creates extremely unpredictable gravitational fluxes, and as a consequence, the formation of extremely rare minerals. These include ultra-rare metals including Ancylitum and Phorydnum and it had been a miner's plunder-haven for as long as it had been identified. The only settlement on the world is Cinchare Minehead.

It is an Imperial world almost completely surrounded by Tau-controlled space.[1f] The T'au discovered Gravalax in 837.M41 and initiated diplomatic contact with the planet's government.[1a] By 931.M41, the T'au Empire had established a trading mission on the planet, were making overtures to the Governor, and had become highly popular among the planet's citizenry.[1b] Although Gravalax itself was of no strategic value, the Imperium refused to allow the Tau to make any further inroads into Imperial territory. On the other hand, the Imperium was painfully aware that provoking open war with the Tau would waste military resources that were desperately needed in other theatres. In response, a number of Imperial Guard Regiments under the command of Lord General Zyvan[1e] were ordered to garrison Gravalax in an attempt to dissuade the t'au.[1b] This led to what became known as the Gravalax Incident.
Canopus	Canopus is a Hive World in the Calixis Sector. It is the seat of the Ministorum Arch-Diocese of the Josian Reach which is considered a poor domain and a struggle to rule. Hive Anterior is one of its Hive Cities. A Stellar Lab-Torpedo, Lumin-Exol IX, orbits the System's Star and uses its Adamantium hull and Void Shields to research the star from below the outer-photosphere. During the Great Crusade, the world was garrisoned by a force of Blood Angels who oversaw a productive mining operation. Ultimately joined by Iron Hands allies in the Horus Heresy, they fought their former Sons of Horus brothers to mutual annihilation during the Death of Canopus, when the Iron Hands detonated a nuclear weapon to destroy both armies.
Eternal crusade	Warhammer 40,000: Eternal Crusade (commonly shortened to "Eternal Crusade" or "EC") is a Multiplayer Team Shooter set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe. It is being developed by Montreal-based studio Behaviour Interactive. The game released in September of 2016 and was later shutdown in September of 2021. It was available on Steam with both Free-To-Play, Premium (for $20 US), and "Premium-plus-wargear" bundles. The game also allowed a player to start as Free-To-Play and upgrade to Premium via incrementally purchasing Rogue Trader Credits (RTC, the game's Premium currency) until they reached the $20 Premium line. Free-To-play players were prohibited from access to the Assault Marine, Chaos Raptor, Swooping Hawk Aspect, and Ork Stormboy "classes" as well as having 2/3 of all Experience and Requisition "banked" until the player upgraded to Premium. In all other respects, Free-To-Play was identical to Premium status. RTC could be used to acquire cosmetic changes for your characters as well as some exclusive weapons which - while powerful - were not in any particular sense better than weapons you could unlock in game normally. Eternal Crusade is a third-person shooter built in Unreal 4. It uses a fixed, over-the-shoulder camera perspective (except when a player switches to a weapon's scope), has a toggle-able cover system on walls and barricades, and involves a mix of infantry melee and ranged fighting, often supported by jump pack-equipped Assault units and the ability to use transport vehicles and tanks. Most Player-versus-Player battles revolve around the capturing and holding of objectives on the map by the opposed team, with each side being assigned as either the Attacker or Defender at the beginning of the fight by the game's matchmaker system. For those who want a break from Player-versus-Player combat, Eternal Crusade offers a Player-versus-Environment section where a Kill-Team of up to five players can descend into a number of facilities overrun by AI-controlled Tyranids in either "Lair" or "Horde" modes. Each faction also maintains a Garrison map where players can learn about the various weapons, equipment, and class abilities as well as duel or congregate as an in-game social space. Currently all action takes place on or under the surface of the planet Arkhona.
Ystrad	Ystrad is an Imperium world along the edges of Segmentum Solar. The White Templars Chapter are sworn to protect this world, an oath they upheld for 3,000 years. In the M42, the world would begin to be invaded by scout forces of an oncoming Tyranid Hive Fleet. The White Templars Space Marine chapter would make defensive preparation on the world they had sworn to protect 3 millennia prior. Captain Malakite and his White Templars would be in the midst of killing a horde of Lictors as a Sister of Silence and Custodes stand aboard their vessel in Ystrad's orbit. The League of Blackships would arrive in Ystrad's orbit no more than a week prior to the Tyranid's void-host was expected to arrive. Tyranid vanguard organisms have reached the planet's principle cities. The primary goal of Atlacoya, a member of the reconstituted Sisters of Silence, was to collect the reportedly bountiful harvest of psykers. The Custodian Tyrith Shiva Kyrus would choose to join the Silent Sister planetside to both assist in protecting the harvest, as well as for her own mission.

Virtues of the Sons (Short Story)	Virtues of the Sons is an audio drama by Andy Smillie, later released as a short story. Amit, the Flesh Tearer, captain of the Blood Angels duels the vicious gladiator Khârn, and Azkaellon of the Sanguinary Guard faces Lucius, Emperor's Children swordsman, as Sanguinius's chosen sons explore the twin aspects of their nature. Sanguinius, primarch of the Blood Angels, confides to Horus his worries that by allowing their Legions and brother primarchs to embody only a single ideal they are failing as teachers. Horus is dismissive, but Sanguinius decides to organise educational duels for two of his most single-minded captains, Azkaellon and Amit. Azkaellon duels Lucius of the Emperor's Children aboard an oceanic warship, and although Lucius wins by drawing first blood by this point Azkaellon has already tackled him over the side, humiliating him in front of his men and robbing Lucius of the victory he wanted. Amit meets with Khârn on a desert planet that both their Legions have conquered in a joint action and they fight a brutal duel in a trench using axes and cleavers that leaves both badly wounded. When Azkaellon and Amit return to Sanguinius's side for a ritual combat festival of their Legion Sanguinius is disappointed to see that both have adopted their usual roles of defender and attacker, but during their fight notices brief moments in which they adapt to gain advantage, giving him hope that his Legion may survive after all.
Eirene Septimus	Eirene Septimus is a planet of incredibly dense atmosphere where it was seeded by crystals of promethium from a previous geological era. As the planet has finally reached a orbit close enough to the local star to start melting these promethium ice crystals, they are available for harvesting by orbital platforms that can extract the unusually pure promethium as well as atmospheric plasma. It was the site of a Alpha Legion mining operation as well as a battle between the Iron Hands and the Alpha Legion, The Battle of Eirene Septimus.
Gathis II	Gathis II is the current Homeworld of the Doom Eagles Chapter. During the Great Crusade and Horus Heresy, the world was known as Gathis Secundus. It was also one of the notable domains held by the Ultramarines Legion.

You can help to restore them to the article by finding the correct citations and re-integrating the quarantined text and/or images as described in the Help article on citations. Dal'yth is a Major Sept of the Tau Empire established between sometime 606.M38 and 792.M38 during the First Sphere of Expansion.[3a] Before being settled by the Tau Empire, Dal'yth had a wild ecosystem of deep blue foliage and slithering segmented beasts. It was tamed long ago during the First Sphere of Expansion and has been brought into compliance with prime-level colony standards ever since. Because of its high proportion of Water Caste members, Dal'yth has enjoyed beneficial trade agreements and has recently been counted as one of the Nineteen wonders of the Tau Empire.
Pentari	Pentari is a world of the Imperium. At some point prior to 241.M41 Pentari suffered from the predations of a cult. The cultists were known to remove their dead victims' eyes, due to their belief that the eyes were the windows of the soul.

Faldon Kise	Faldon Kise is located in the Malfian Sub-Sector, Calixis Sector, close to the Halo Stars. A marginalized world accessible only by turbulent warp routes, its world has rapidly decayed and turned inward. The bulk of people live a barbaric existence in a vast shanty city amid ruins. A violent culture of ritual murder for wealth and status has arisen with death cults and doomsday prophets rife on the planet's surface.[1a] The few inhabitants of the primitive frontier world are descendants of children of the void, who were suspended as punishment for their crimes on the planet. They live in three small settlements that cluster around an automated monitoring station which marks the outer border of the Imperium. The population is considered to be unreliable, degenerate and wild, and mutations are prevalent in the population. The planet's surface is covered by several jungles.[Help] The most well-known indigenous species in the jungles of Faldon Kise are the Gar-keelers. These are giant porcupines whose tough quills are used by the inhabitants of the planet as a climbing aid. Once the creature is slain, the spines are removed and their base is bevelled into a crude handle, leaving the sharp tip in place. Of course such a manufact can be used also in hand-to-hand combat if the need arises.[1b]
Sevayin	Sevayin is an Imperium world and was the Homeworld of the 914th Sevayin Reavers Regiment.
Sanctus Lys	Sanctus Lys is an Imperial backwater Shrine World, that lies within the Palatine Sector.

Profundis (World)	Profundis is a mist-wreathed world, that is being raided by the Dark Eldar in M42. The Deathwatch Chaplain Cassius is currently leading a Kill-Team to kill the invading Xenos.
Scound's Fall	Scound's Fall is an Imperial world which lies some 100 light years from Terra. Scound's Fall would be the site of one of the most daring Chaos Space Marines raids to date in M41. Having slipped through the Cadian Gate, a small flotilla of ships from the Night Lords spent months in the Warp evading detection by Imperium patrols. Scound's Fall was chosen as a target because of its large Schola Progenium Abbey, a place where future Admirals, Commissars, Storm Troopers, and Sisters of Battle were housed and trained by the Adeptus Ministorum. The viciousness of the Night Lords' attack left no survivors after seven days of fighting, and butchered remains of both sides were laid out in talismanic patterns to help with the summoning of Daemons. Having gorged themselves on the souls and bodies of humans, the Daemons rampaged across half the world while the Night Lords left, eluding Imperial warships intent on their capture.
Marfak	Marfak is a Desert World. In their pursuit of the Word Bearers Chaos Lord Zymran, Captain Kruger's Ultramarines Company raided Marfak for supplies.
Drakaasi	Drakaasi is a Daemon World within the Eye of Terror dedicated to the worship of Khorne. Like most Daemon Worlds, Drakaasi is mind-warpingly strange. Befitting of a world dedicated to Khorne, its greatest feature is a sea of blood which connects the cities of the planet. Each city has its own arena where games are held in honour of the Blood God. Some are no more than shanty towns sitting atop the ocean of blood while others are unique; one is a great crystal which resonates with music dedicated to the lord of battles, another is nothing but a battlefield where men are regularly sent to their deaths to add to the Skull Throne, and yet another is a graveyard where the titanic remains of gigantic warriors and their weapons litter the ground and have been turned into dwellings by the new inhabitants. Each honours the Blood God in its own way. Underneath the great cities of Drakaasi are many caverns where Scaephylyds, the xenos who form the slave caste of the daemon world, dwell.
Ularis Prime	Ularis Prime was the site of a battle between the Eldar and the Death Watch.
Thanatos	Thanatos is a Necron Tomb World and a world of the Oruscar Dynasty. It is home to the Celestial Orrery. Thanatos has recently become a battleground as various factions seek to wrest the Celestial Orrery from the Oruscar Dynasty. The first threat came from the Word Bearers, but these were defeated with the help of the Kardenath Dynasty. However this dynasty in turn desired the Orrery, and the siege has continued in a civil war between Necrons.

When they encounter eldar from Craftworld Iyanden, a daemonic secret is revealed in their midst that threatens to tear them apart. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Ultak	Ultak is a Hive World of the Imperium that was invaded by Daemons in the aftermath of the Great Rift's creation during the Thirteenth Black Crusade. However, the Salamanders Chapter has since arrived to save the world.
Gloriam	Gloriam is a world in Segmentum Pacificus, and is part of the Cabulis System. It is a munitions testing ground. Currently it and the entire Cabulis System is under attack by Waaagh! Gragnatz.
Maypax	Maypax is a Jungle Death World, that is being fought over by the Imperium and Orks. It was initially a world of peace and purity, which had been unspoiled by the ravages of war and hate. Maypax also held a primitive Human population, which thrived and flourished under its perpetual sun. However this all ended, when the Death Guard's Typhus the Traveller arrived on the world and began being worshiped as a god by its population. The presence of the Herald of Nurgle not only turned the primitive Humans into Heretics, but Typhus also corrupted Maypax itself as well. The Traveller later left the world and gifted Maypax's population with a fragment of his power armour. The Fragment of Typhus contained a portion of the Herald's dark power and the Humans placed it in the Temple of Typhus, that had been built to honor him. Shortly afterwards, though, Maypax was struck by Warp Storms and was cut off from the Galaxy for five centuries. When the Warp Storms finally cleared, the Adeptus Mechanicus discovered the Fragment's existence and sought to claim the powerful artefact for themselves, before it fell into unwise hands. By then, though, Maypax had been turned into a Jungle Death World, that contained many lethal threats. This included the Orks, as well as flying insects who could drain a Human of fluids if they were attacked by a swarm. The Temple of Typhus was also filled with dangers, as Nurglings haunted its interior. These dangers led to the deaths of two of the Adeptus Mechanicus' Explorator teams, as they sought to recover the Fragment of Typhus. The Mechanicus, though, had sent its agent Jamona Hilt to Maypax, as a backup-plan and had him transferred to the Catachans' 19'ers Platoon. It was among the Imperium's forces that were now fighting the Orks, and Hilt masqueraded as a Guardsman for several months. When he learned that the second Explorator team died before it could recover the Fragment, Hilt acted at once and manipulated the 19'ers' Captain, Obdant, into recovering it. Though the Captain did not known what the artefact was, he agreed to do so, after Hilt convinced him that it was likely valuable. Taking Hilt and a small number of the 19'ers, Obdant journeyed to the Temple of Typhus and found the Fragment. However it was then that Hilt betrayed the ground and attempted to kill them, after explaining who he was and the Fragment's origin. Hilt then planned on escaping with the Fragment afterwards, but before he could kill them, the Mechanicus agent was attacked by the 19'ers Ogryn Moom. This knocked Hilt into the pillar the Fragment of Typhus was floating above and caused the Temple of Typhus to begin to collapse.
Cthartek	Cthartek is a Hive World whose Underhive skinner-gangs worship Khorne. They know him as the Bladesman and honour the Chaos God by flensing the skulls of their rivals and then piling them into pyramids.

Trontiux III	Trontiux III is a recruiting world for the Blood Ravens Chapter.
Lorn V	Lorn V is an Ice World of the Imperium. The planet's most significant feature was the wreck of an Imperial Titan called the Dominatus, fought over by four different factions at once, including: Through the Battle of Lorn V the 9th Company of the Blood Ravens fought on this planet, using strange relic Predators with unidentified main turret weapons.
Khoraj	Khoraj is the Homeworld of the Iron Champions Space Marine Chapter.
Thantus X	Thantus X was a former world of the Imperium, now held by the Orks. In 899.M40, the Mordian 189th Armoured [[Imperial Guard Regiment|Regiment were manning a successful defence against an Ork Waaagh!, when a novice Tech-Priest gave the wrong benedictions while arming a Vortex Missile. This caused the missile to explode before it could be launched and resulted in the destruction of the Imperials' fortifications. The aftermath led not only to the loss of Thantus X to the Orks, but the entire system’s food supply as well.
Spectoris	Spectoris is an Agri World in the Calixis Sector. It is primarily covered in water.
Orlen	Orlen is an Imperium world that was raided by the Blood Gorgons Warband.

Hunted (Short Story)	In the long war against the forces of Chaos on an Imperial world, an agent of the Inquisition must be extracted from enemy territory with vital information: the identity of a traitor within the Imperial ranks, an insidious infiltrator of the Alpha Legion. As he flees from those who would keep his secret to themselves, the agent little realises that the greatest danger may be ahead of him.
Taros Campaign	Occurring in 998.M41[1a], precipitated by The Denab Incident[1b], the Taros Campaign pitched Imperial forces against the Taros Planetary Defence Forces, the Tau, and their Kroot mercenary allies in a series of battles over the planet Taros, known as T'ros to the Tau.[1k] The recapturing of Taros was important because it was instrumental for the continued operations of the Forge World Stygies VIII, which in turn was important in the war against Abaddon's 13th Black Crusade.[1p] Prior to the campaign, Planetary Governor Aulis, head of the Taros government, developed friendly trading relations with the Tau, and sought to defect to the Tau Empire with the support of much of the planetary population.[1c]
Ugmok's World	Ugmok's World was once an Ork World, until it was invaded by the Daemons of Nurgle in M42, who were led by Rotigus, Horticulous Slimux and Epidemius. The Ork tribes that dwelled there fought for all they were worth against the invaders, but with reality itself putrefying around them, their end was inevitable.
Theron (Planet)	Theron is a gas giant planet of the Imperium. The Adeptus Mechanicus maintains a number of Arco-Refinery Platforms suspended in Theron's upper atmosphere which act as lightning conductors, storing massive amounts of electrical charge. At one point the planet was invaded by a force of Orks, with the greenskins attacking from a number of Roks that they had guided into the atmosphere. It was believed by the strategos of the Departmento Munitorum that the Orks wanted to capture the planet's arco-refineries so they could refuel and rearm before continuing corewards. The planet's PDF was bolstered by a local Imperial Navy battlegroup and a force of Space Marines — the Wolf Lord Kjarl Grimblood dispatched eight packs of Space Wolves from his Great Company, the Grimbloods, to aid in defending the Platforms and they were joined by a Deathwatch Kill-Team led by Caius Vorens.
Cano'var	Cano'var was formerly a world of the Tau Empire before being overrun by Necron forces under Overlord Zahndrekh in 813.M41. Lightly defended, the world's small defence force was overrun by the Necrons in two weeks.
Sisk	Sisk is a Feudal World in the Calixis Sector. It is a isolated world, described as a bleak and unforgiving land of windswept moors, brooding forests of malformed trees and foul swamps. The population of the world has a larger than normal mutation rate, leading to mutants with additional joints in arms, legs, hands, and feet. This mutation type seems relatively stable and is under investigation if it can be classed as a sanctioned abhuman strain. The world resonates in the Warp. Several Chaos warbands have seen fit to intervene from time to time, and a handful made the planet their home base in the region. A deep thread of heresy and genetic corruption has poisoned much of Sisk’s population. Many of the mutants lurking in the planet’s mist-ridden highlands have sworn dire oaths to the Dark Gods, and a surprising number of nobles in the Lord Governor’s court have joined them. The Governor, Lord Gavvit, remains mostly unaware of these plots and schemes amongst his own followers, but he has begun to suspect that the “mutant problem” far from his capital is much more severe than anyone truly understands.
Fourtheden	Fourtheden is a Agri World of the Severan Dominate in The Periphery in the Calixis Sector. As an agri-world, Fourtheden provides a substantial portion of the Severan Dominate’s food supply. The vast majority of the secessionists’ strategic reserve came from tithes taken from this planet. If the Duke lost his hold on the world, several others might fall in short order. Without its bounty, the secessionists would be unable to provide the necessary supplies to a number of worlds that rely upon imported foods. Consequently, this system and its agricultural bounty represent a key holding to the rebel forces. Fourtheden enjoys a very mild climate and only slight seasonal changes. This is largely due to the fact that the world has a nearly circular orbit around its system primary, and only the slightest of axial shifts. These factors combine to yield a world with a perpetual growing season. Both the native organisms and the humans who have made it their home have adapted to take advantage of the ongoing harvests.
Lima Rogan	Lima Rogan is an Imperial world. This planet was part of the empire of Cardinal Bucharis during the Plague of Unbelief. It was one of the earliest planets to revolt under the influence of Confessor Dolan Chirosius.
Gryphonne IV	Gryphonne IV was a major Forge World of the Imperium[1a] and the fourth planet of the Gryphonne System. Gryphonne IV was threatened and eventually turned into a Dead World by Hive Fleet Leviathan.[1a] Before its destruction Gryphonne IV was the home of the Legio Gryphonicus[1a], fearsomely disciplined Skitarii legions, and could boast the finest defences of any world in the galactic south of the Galaxy. Gryphonne IV was also responsible for designing many of the Imperial Guard's vehicles, for example a Chimera variant armed with an Autocannon or with a twin-linked Heavy Bolters[1g], and a pattern of the Leman Russ Vanquisher.[1b] The planetary tithe of the agriworld Tygra once supplied its processed foodstuffs to the Gryphonnen Empire, supplying half the Octad with sustenance.[8h]
The Only Good Ork (Short Story)	The Only Good Ork is a short story in the Ciaphas Cain series by Sandy Mitchell. Deployed to the agri world of Frumentamunda to eradicate a local genestealer cult, Ciaphas Cain shies away from the thick of battle with his trademark sense of discretion. Just his luck, this cunning escape brings him up against an even more dangerous enemy – a feral ork, ready to deliver a proper krumpin'...
Greater Eydolim	Greater Eydolim is a gas giant of the Eydolim System. Though inhabitable, vast orbital mining platforms existed which were used to mine the planet for promethium gas.[1b] During the Battle of Eagle Gate, its vast gas deposits were detonated by a force of Red Corsairs, creating an explosion so massive it was seen from halfway across the system.[1b][1c]
Chimera	The Chimera is the primary armoured infantry transport for the Imperial Guard. Highly durable and practical it has been used as a chassis for many other vehicles and has been in service for many thousands of years, typifying the fast moving warfare favoured by the Imperial Guard.[2a] The primary duty of the Chimera is to accompany tanks into battle and provide protection for the Guardsmen within so that they may support the tanks. Standard doctrine states that after the Chimera reaches its objective it lays down covering fire with its heavy weapons while the squad within disembarks and advances. The Chimera then falls back to a firing position from which it can still support the infantry and await orders to race forward and collect the squad again to reposition them.[3b] When operating as part of an armoured advanced the Chimera often operate ahead of or on the flanks, as well as side-by-side with the Leman Russ Battle Tanks, providing additional weight to the tanks' massed firepower. Besides the added mobility, firepower and protection, Chimeras allow infantry to take extra gear, including med-kits, vox equipment and more ammunition, making them far more efficient than their foot-slogging infantry.[3b] The Chimera is less useful though when forced to fight in urban settings or as part of static defences. The Chimera can fulfil additional roles and many basic variants of the standard vehicle exist. With their communication equipment and scanners Chimeras are suitable command vehicles, while those with Dozer Blades can clear terrain for heavier vehicles to move through or provide night-time illumination from their Searchlights.[2a] While generally armed with a Multi-laser and Heavy Bolter, those fitted with a Heavy Flamer are popular when fighting in dense terrain such as jungles and forests; usually one in three Chimeras will be outfitted as a flame tank if other infantry close support vehicles, such as Demolishers, Thunderers and Hellhounds, are unavailable. Those equipped with Autocannons also fulfil the light anti-vehicle role, while Gryphonne IV makes a unique Chimera variant mounting twin-linked Heavy Bolters, particularly effective against dense infantry formations such as Ork mobs and Tyranid swarms.[3b] The Chimera's chassis has also been employed to serve as a base platform for many specialised variants, including fuel tankers, ambulances, munitions carriers and even battlefield construction vehicles with bulldozers and cranes.
Oriflame	Oriflame is a world of the Imperium. The planet was attacked by the Night Lords with Imperial forces unable to repel them, when the entire Red Scorpions Chapter arrived in orbit. Newly arrived in Imperium space, after their three hundred year Crusade in the Ordon Rift, they turned the tide of the battle and helped defeat the Night Lords.
Zaramund	Zaramund is an Imperial world. Located fairly close to Caliban, Zaramund became a shipyard world that organized fleets for the Great Crusade. During the Crusade, the world was invaded by Imperial forces consisting of the Dark Angels, Luna Wolves, and Death Guard. The campaign became an issue of dispute between Lion El'Jonson and Luther that saw the latter exiled back to Caliban. During the campaign Calas Typhon became converted to Chaos after receiving a revelation from an old woman.[2b]
Sabatine	Sabatine was once the homeworld of the White Consuls Chapter and was located to the galactic south of the Eye of Terror. In the aftermath of the Great Rift's creation, during the Thirteenth Black Crusade, Sabatine was left almost unprotected — only skeletal guards of Fourth Company of the White Consuls Chapter, Praetorian Guards and PDF remains. Already fighting with the Daemons, left without the light of Astronomican Sabatine was attacked and overrun by the forces of Chaos warbands: of the Death Guard known as the Lords of Silence and the Weeping Veil of the Word Bearers[4a]; though the remnants of the White Consuls Chapter managed to escape before Sabatine was changed forever. After the victory of the Lords of Silence and withdrawing of the Word Bearers from the planet, Sabatine was re-made to the Nurgle planet, as a copy of the Plague Planet itself.[4b]
Perechar	Perechar is the Homeworld of an unknown Space Marine Chapter and it lies near the Eye of Terror.
Kleimoran	Kleimoran was the site of a campaign for the White Scars Legion during the Great Crusade which lasted for several years.
Lliax	Lliax was a Forge World that sided with the Loyalists during the Horus Heresy.
Phaenon Prime	Phaenon Prime was a former Hive World of the Imperium, before it embraced Chaos worship and was destroyed. Phaenon Prime was an isolated Hive World, which suffered from pirate activity, xenos slaver raids, and much worse. Its situation only worsened in recent years as what little Imperial protection it received was cut away to aid in the nearby Angevin Crusade. Increasingly embittered, Phaenon Prime’s Lord Commander declared secession from the Imperium and with the aid of ships from their new pirate allies soon crushed any resistance from neighbouring planets. In an orgy of bloodletting, he threw down the blessed icons of the Ministorum and raised the foul idols of Chaos in their place, bargaining that the Imperium's preoccupation with the bloody toll of the ongoing conquest of the Calyx Expanse would protect him from swift retribution. He was proven wrong as the notorious Xanthite Lord Inquisitor and warlord Kobras Aquairre arrived with an Inquisition fleet taskforce, re-diverted from the Angevin Crusade, to end the rebellion with extreme prejudice. Smashing aside the raider ships and crippling the planetary defences, Aquairre's judgment on Phaenon Prime was as harsh as it was merciless, and he deployed the Life Eater virus without delay. A Hive World of fourteen billion souls was slaughtered in punishment for their pride and blasphemy unto the last living thing. Afterwards Phaenon Prime was given over as a dominion of the Holy Ordos and quickly began to be used as repository for captured weapons and prisoners to be studied by the cabal of Xanthites drawn to the distant, dead world.
Moltova	Moltova is an Imperial Hive World. Due to the world's harsh environment, Moltova's Guardsmen are already battle hardened by the time they join its Imperial Guard Regiments.
Translock	Translock is a world of the Imperium, that was saved from the ravages of Hive Fleet Kraken.
Lostok 23rd	The Lostock 23rd is an Imperial Guard Infantry Regiment, the famous veterans of the Gland War on the Forge World of Dantris III. When Dantris III was invaded by Tyranids, regiments from the nearby world of Lostock were drafted in to combat the menace. The surface of Dantris III was heavily polluted and the infestation of Tyranid organisms made fighting outside the factory-complexes almost impossible. A few companies of the Lostock 23rd were modified by the Techpriests to fight in the hellish war zone. Incorporating many organs and drug-secreting glands that enabled them to survive unprotected, as well as boosting their combat abilities. Only a handful of Gland Warriors are believed to have survived the conflict, which saw the Tyranid swarm repulsed from Dantris III. The process by which the companies of the Lostock 23rd became Gland Warriors are understood by only a few Techpriests, and are rarely utilized, for the Inquisition invariably take an interest in the use of such technologies. Nonetheless, a number of regiments have been subjected to the process, and can be found across the galaxy.
Mu'gulath Bay	Mu'gulath Bay was a Sept of the Tau Empire. Mu'gulath Bay is known as the gateway to the Dovar System, and has become a key strategic point for further Tau expansion into Imperial territory.[1a] Previously an Imperial Hive World known as Agrellan, the planet was captured by Commander Shadowsun and Ethereal Supreme Aun'va during the Third Sphere of Expansion. During the ensuing Battle of Mu'gulath Bay, Tau XV104 Battlesuits proved decisive in defeating the Imperial Guard heavy tanks which guarded the world's capital Hive.[1a] The battle to capture the planet has been the largest of the Third Sphere of Expansion, and no less than twelve advanced weapons prototypes were used by the Tau. Only the fusion reactor meltdown that destroyed Mu'gulath Bay's moon proved a failure.[1b]
Phaethon IV	Phaethon IV is a former world of the Imperium. The Crimson Consuls' Second and Fourth Company had a garrison rotation on the industrial world when the Celebrants Chapter were kept guarding the Cardinal World of Nedicta Secundus from a possible attack from Hive Fleet Kraken. During their garrison duty, the world was attacked by Orks led by Dregz Wuzghal, Arch-Mogul of Gunza Major. The Crimson Consuls and Phaethon IV PDF fought bravely against Waaagh! Wuzghal and could possibly have won, when the battle awoke the sleeping Necron beneath the planet. Caught between these two forces, the Crimson Consuls companies and the planet's PDF were destroyed. Now the world is a battlefield between the Necron and the Arch-Mogul's forces.
Epsilon Tokugawa III	Epsilon Tokugawa III is an Imperium world, that contains formalized horse-warrior aristocracies, known as the Badokai. These elite warriors serve as the source for the world's Rough Rider Regiments.
Charadon (Planet)	Charadon is the center of the Ork Empire of Charadon, the largest and most long-standing Ork Empire of its kind. Charadon is situated in the Imperium's Ultima Segmentum, near the Imperial world of Badlanding and is only a few weeks warp-travel away from Rynn's World. The current Warlord ruling Charadon takes the title of a pyromaniac berserker, the Arch-Arsonist, lending the persona a kind of immortality.
Karnak II	Karnak II is an Imperium planet liberated during the Saint-Saen Crusade. Following the Crusade, an Adeptus Mechanicus exploration team recovered the Lightning STC patterns there.
Lesser Evils (Short Story)	Lesser Evils is a short story by Toby Frost. It was first published in Hammer and Bolter 13, under the name Tom Foster, and re-published online in May 2014. Lucan Vaughn and his Inquisition task force, veterans of a hundred battles, descend upon the world of Rand XXI on a mission to seize an important asset for their mysterious master. But this mission will bring them into conflict with another branch of the Imperium, for their target is a captive of the Adepta Sororitas, the pious Sisters of Battle. Infiltrating a convent-prison, Vaughn and his team must struggle with the idea of fighting other servants of the Emperor if they are to survive and achieve their goal.
Finreht Highlanders	The Finreht Highlanders are Imperial Guard Regiments raised from Finreht Three-Seven.[Needs Citation] The inhabitants of the wild and mountainous world of Finreht Three-Seven are a nomadic people that follow the migratory herds of mountain Grox that were introduced to the planet long ago. They construct their houses along the Grox migratory routes and change their dwellings with the change of seasons. Each tribe holds hereditary right of property on a particular herd, although they do not have any control on the direction of their movement. Each tribe survives by the welfare of its herd. They hunt the weaker Grox to eat and trade the tanned skins with other tribes when they have a surplus.[Needs Citation] According to ancient tradition, once every five cycles the tribes must pay a tribute to the Imperial governors, who reside in huge walled star ports located in the valleys, which are the only permanent settlements on the planet. When the day arrives to pay the tribute, the best shepherds of the tribe must separate a portion of the flock and lead on the arduous journey to the distant valleys. The governors will select a portion of these herds for slaughter and distribution throughout the Agrippina Sector, providing food to overpopulated planets.[Needs Citation]

In the year 837.M41 the Space Wolves, Angels Vindicant and Flesh Tearers Space Marine Chapters fought on the world of shrine world of Lucid Prime, as part of the Eclipse Wars, with the goal of defeating Chaos Space Marine elements assaulting the Hive of Ratspire. Thanks to a ferocious Flesh Tearers counter-attack, the Imperial forces were able to drive off the enemy. But the Flesh Tearers, their bloodlust not yet sated, continued on into the Hive, indiscriminately killing the citizens there. Flesh Tearers Chapter Master Gabriel Seth assured the Space Wolves and Angels Vindicant that they were only purging those possessed of Chaos taint, a claim which the Space Wolves are outraged by and consequently attack the Flesh Tearers. The day plays out with brother fighting brother with the death of hundred on either side, with the event forever known from then on as Honour's End.
Zantragora	Zantragora is a Necron Tomb World located in Ultima Segmentum.[1a] The Necron Lords of Zantragora have become obsessed with undoing the biotransferrence that transformed their Necrontyr bodies into Necron shells of living metal. They have sought to return to bodies of flesh through apotheosis, transferring their consciousness into the bodies of other sentient creatures. To this end, the legions and fleets of Zantragora scour the galaxy for fresh subjects, collecting live samples for brutally slow experimentation.[1b] Zantragora is home to the Zantragora Conclave, a powerful Cryptek Conclave led by Illuminor Szeras.

On a world populated almost entirely by Flayed Ones, Valgul is somehow immune to the Flayer Virus and is thus the only Necron on Drazak who has retained his senses. When his world runs out of meat for his Flayed Ones subjects, Valgul announces new "Times of Bounty" and launches devastating raids against nearby worlds, intending to harvest gore and blood. The Sautekh Dynasty's interests amongst the Ghoul Stars include efforts to prevent the expansion of Valgûl's Bone Kingdom into the Eastern Fringe, and is known not to be receptive to Sautekh regents.

Komaris	Komaris is a fallen Imperial world located in the Moebian Domain's Fringe Region. It once served as the bastion of Imperial authority in the Moebian Fringe for roughly 10,000 years.[2a] Komaris recently fell during the Fringe War of late M41 or early M42.[1a] Since the domain's inception during the Great Crusade, it has been the primary bastion defending the Moebian Domain's core worlds against the Darktide threats from the Moebian Fringe and keeping Imperial order in the Moebian Fringe Region.[2b] The world known as Messelina Gloriana attempts to fill the role that Komaris once did, as the primary world defending against Darktide threats from beyond the Moebian Fringe and keeping Imperial order within the Fringe Region.[1a] The Komaris Memorial Feast is a holiday local to the Moebian Domain. The faithful Wardens of the Moebian Domain's Wardenchain often oversee these memorial feasts.[1b]
Ornsworld	Ornsworld, also referred to as Orn's World[Help], is an Imperial world[2b] and a Ratling homeworld located in Segmentum Obscurus.[2b] Prior to the Gothic War, Chaos forces raided the planet in search of the Eye of Night artefact which was embedded in an ancient statue worshiped as a god by the Ratlings in pre-Imperial times. At first the Chaos forces were driven back by the presence of a nearby Imperial Guard recruiting force. Returning a month later, however, the Chaos ships blockaded Ornsworld and launched a full scale invasion. Millions of Ratlings were slaughtered. Amongst the carnage the Chaos forces successfully escaped with the Eye of Night.

In 998.M41, local mining operations awoke the Necrons slumbering beneath the planet's surface, resulting in the loss of thousands of labourers and servitors. An incoming force of the 34th Psian Vipers regiment of the Tempestus Scions destroyed the xenos over the course of several weeks.
Mara	Mara-V, known as Mara, is an Ice World in the Calixis Sector. It was a former arbites penal colony between 743.M41 and 768.M41, and before that it was an independent mining settlement between 980.M40 and 191.M41.[3i] The planet is now forbidden by the Inquisition after a series of warp incursions in 768.M41[3e] which killed 78% of the population. The Mara System is now under an Inquisition-imposed naval quarantine, and is only accessible with authorization from the Calixis Conclave.[3i] Between 980.M40 and 191.M41, Mara was an independent mining settlement.[3i] Between 743.M41 and 768.M41, Mara was used as a arbites penal colony for the worst recidivist elements of the sector[3c]; these inmates conducted mining and prospecting operations as tithe.[3i]
Kolagar	Kolagar is a world of the Imperium located in the Vensine Sector. After a mass of uprisings instigated across the Sector by the Emperor's Children, the Imperium launched the Vensine Crusade to pacify the rebellions. Kolagar was one of the first worlds liberated by the Crusade after a year of brutal fighting involving multiple Astra Militarum Regiments, becoming a vital link in the Crusade's supply chain. Some time after the initial reconquest, however, Kolagar became infested by Sslyth mercenary warclades aligned with the Emperor's Children. A Deathwatch Kill-Team led by Sergeant Decurius attempted to wipe out the Sslyth by detonating a series of virus bombs within the Xenos' breeding grounds. The mission was ultimately unsuccessful; the Kill-Marines were able to kill thousands of Sslyth, but some escaped into the jungles of Kolagar. Although the planet was eventually cleansed, many Guardsmen died in the long, brutal campaign.
Red Scar	The Red Scar is a sector or subsector[4a][Conflicting sources] of Ultima Segmentum, whose thousands of stars all shine a shade of crimson, tinting its worlds and gas clouds with the color of spilt blood.[1a][4a] Each of its Systems are cursed with ferocious radiation emitted by these scarlet suns, and life there is exceptionally hard. The Red Scar is rich with valuable resources, though, so the Imperium has established settlements in hundreds of its Systems, despite the cost being billions of lives to do so.[1a] In the aftermath of the Great Rift's creation, the Tau Empire attempted to annex parts of the Red Scar from the Nem'yar Atoll, but were stopped by the Space Marines of the Blood Angels Chapter, whose home-System resides in the region. Now, though, the Red Scar has been invaded by multiple tendrils of Hive Fleet Leviathan and the Blood Angels have launched another campaign to save it.[1b]
Grimoyr	Grimoyr is a planet in the Sabbat Worlds which was occupied by the forces of Chaos. During the Sabbat Worlds Crusade, the Imperial campaign to reclaim the planet began around 764.M41, at least a year prior to the Battle of Balhaut, but ground on with little success. After his succession of Warmaster Slaydo, Macaroth handed command of the theatre to Lord General Noches Sturm, commander of the Royal Volpone 50th. It took Sturm only a week to achieve his promised victory, thanks to skillful use of his armoured support, and, confronting the forces of Magister Sharenidy in the capital city, Malthus, triumphed. Sharenidy killed himself rather than be captured. Sturm would write of the Grimoyr campaign, "after this, all battles will be easy, all victories simple, all glories hollow."[2a] Ironically, Sturm would later be disgraced during the Siege of Vervunhive on Verghast, by his gross negligence (including a signal failure to employ the amoured units under his command)[2b] and his cowardice in the face of the enemy.[2c]

The daemon, the xenos, and the heretic. In such a kiln the heroes of war are forged. From the beleaguered foot soldiers of the Astra Militarum and the flying aces of the Imperial Navy, to secretive Inquisitors and heroic Adeptus Astartes, the warriors of the Imperium fight amidst the guttering light of civilisation while chaotic warlords seek to snuff it out. With the galaxy at stake, who will be left standing triumphant in the ashes?
Pech	Pech is the homeworld, also known as the nest world, of the Kroot. Pech has three main continental masses; the largest of these is a warm and temperate, and covered in evergreen jagga trees. It is a place of steaming jungles, enormous forests, towering mountains and abundant wildlife. Unforested areas are rocky, parched, or affected by violent storms, and generally inhospitable. The native species of Pech have been almost made extinct due to Kroot activity. Fauna consists almost entirely of Kroot and their subspecies, such as krootox, kroot hounds, and what may be the original kroot genus, the kroothawk.
Ossorian	Ossorian is an Imperial Industrial World, whose population in the city of Carchera whisper about the legend of the Valgaast Train. According to rumors, it travels around the city on moonless nights, stopping only at disused stations, before taking its passengers to Valgaast. No one knows where or what Valgaast is, as it does not appear anywhere on Ossorian's current maps, but it is supposed to contain hordes of treasure. This has drawn the interest of many who wish to become wealthy, but those that find and board the train, will not be able to leave afterwards. They'll discover that the Valgaast Train's now sealed doors, will only open when they are near new passengers ready to come aboard and that the train simply moves too fast to escape while its traveling. The train's passengers are also blocked from reaching its locomotive, by large groups of pale silent robed figures who bar their path. When the train finally stops for good, the robed figures disembark and the other passengers will find they are not at Valgaast. Instead they are at the Bogardus Complex, whose manufactories closed down centuries ago and which is hundreds of miles away from the city of Carchera. With the train no longer moving, the passengers are likely to follow the robed figures who enter a nearby tunnel chamber and begin chanting. Once that chanting stops, however, a monstrous Genestealer Patriarch will appear and the robed figures, who are in fact members of its Cult, will block the train's passengers from leaving. The Patriarch will then begin feeding on the passengers, as the Cult has spread the myth of the Valgaast Train in order to lure in food for it to consume. Only a few passengers will be spared from this fate and will instead become new members of the Cult, after receiving the Genestealer's Kiss. Those that are chosen are then returned to Carchera, where they begin spreading rumors about the Valgaast Train and the immense wealth the train will take its passengers to.

The resulting war has badly bled both the Tyranids and Orks, and it has yet to be determined which side will emerge victorious.
Yue	Yue is a Desert World that was the site of a battle which saw the Blood Angels Chapter's Fourth Company defeat the forces of the Black Legion.
Gheden	Gheden is a Necron Tomb World which serves as the crownworld of the Nihilakh Dynasty. Due to a devastating fault in its dimensional stabiliser array, Gheden is half-phased in a pocket dimension for all but a few hours of its stellar orbit. This has since proved to be a great advantage, as their world is now entirely impervious to assault. Deep beneath Gheden's surface lies the Oracle Chamber, wherein the bulbous head of an ancient alien prophet dubbed the Yyth Seer is kept alive in stasis. The Prophet's thoughts are projected onto holographic images which are said to be able to predict the future. Early in M42, Gheden was assaulted by Imperial forces but the Nihilakh managed to annihilate them.

In 845.M41 it fell victim to a Warp Storm and the entire population was wiped out in an orgy of blood, becoming a Daemon World. At noon on the Feast of the Emperor's Ascension, the skies of Golia VII turned rust-red, and three days later began raining blood. The Planetary Governor publicly called for calm, but in a private council meeting learned that his world was within the projected path of a Warp Storm. The council questioned why the planet's Astropaths had not warned them earlier, noting their absence from the meeting. They were found later that same day, blood drained from every orifice, their bodies locked in twisted, tortured screams. Golia VII's Planetary Defense Force was mobilized, and one hundred eighty million soldiers began preparing their planet's defenses. Six major cities were ringed with mile upon mile of defensive trenches and fortifications, each protected by millions of troopers and thousands of artillery pieces. However, the skies continued to rain blood day after day, and the soldiers were haunted by nightly dreams of torture, pain and suffering, further eroding morale. Military police were forced to institute summary mass executions for desertions after entire companies began leaving their posts.

Though the T'au captured the world initially from Vostroyan Firstborn Imperial Guard, it was retaken by the Black Templars during the Nimbosa Crusade.
Dennar IV	Dennar IV is an Imperial Agri World, that also serves as a source of Aspirants for the Howling Griffons Chapter. Its surface consists of savannas filled with of herds of thunderhorn, urgrox, and other megafauna with fortified slaughter cities. In 109.M40 the Howling Griffons' 3rd Company, led by Captain Penvath Joachim, responded to a call for aid from Dennar IV. When they arrived at the agri world, they discovered a hand full of city-states full of refugees holding out against a horde of cultists some of whom were possessed by daemons. Using their superior armour and tactics, the Howling Griffons rallied the local forces and led a long and bloody struggle to clear the planet of the uprising. After this action, the Howling Griffons have kept a lasting oath to protect the planet; in return they are able to count Dennar IV as one of their recruiting planets.

Prospero	Prospero was the Homeworld of Magnus the Red and his Space Marine Legion, the Thousand Sons. Devastated and depopulated during the Horus Heresy in M31, Prospero remained a Dead World until M42, when the Thousand Sons returned to rebuild it. Prospero was a desolate, dark planet and was chosen by its inhabitants because of its distance from Terra. Mutants and Psykers lived in reclusion and study, and Magnus fit in well with this group due to his incredible psychic potential.[Needs Citation] In the end, the only good thing about Prospero was its remoteness, which made it easy to hide on. It had one major city, Tizca, a gleaming city of white marble, with spires reaching into the sky. It was situated on the most central of the many mountains of the planet, nourished by underground hydroponics and techno-psychic collectible arrays providing sustainable energy. All the towers were gleaming and there were soaring obelisks and towering pyramids.[Needs Citation]
World of Immortal Sorrows	The World of Immortal Sorrows is a Daemon World in the Eye of Terror. The original (Eldar) name of this planet has been lost after the The Fall. Formally a Crone World of the Eldar, it was one of the seats of Eldar power before the Fall.

Nonimax	Nonimax Is a hive world in the Sabbat Worlds which was occupied by the forces of Chaos. During the Sabbat Worlds Crusade, Nonimax was assaulted in 765.M41, one of the first planets attacked under the leadership of Warmaster Macaroth, after his succession of Warmaster Slaydo at the Battle of Balhaut. Because of Nonimax's considerable agricultural output, it was vital to the supply lines being established for Macaroth's ambitious push toward the Cabal Systems. The campaign took only six weeks, thanks largely to Macaroth's skilful deployment of the Pragar regiments, a clear sign to the new Warmaster's detractors that he understood the strengths of each Guard unit under his command and how best to utilize them.
Varoli Secundus	Varoli Secundus is an Imperial world known for its fanatical theocratic government. Consisting of a ruling council of priests, the government strictly enforces the Imperial Cult on the world and believes it a sacred duty to serve in the Imperial Guard.

Visions that Eldrad received foretold that a Warp Rift would soon open upon Dabenlar IV and the servants of the Dark Gods would rupture forth and overwhelm the lightly defended world. His visions warned that if Dabenlar IV fell, it would be the first of a hundred planets that would fall to the servants of Chaos. Knowing that this would endanger the lives of the Eldar, Eldred travelled to Dabenlar IV and met with its Planetary Governor to warn him of the Warp Rift and the danger his world was in. The Planetary Governor refused to listen to the Farseer, however, and told Eldrad that Chaos was nothing but a myth.[1a] Though rebuffed, Eldrad still hung to the belief that the Imperium could defend the world from the ravages of the Warp, if they were properly prepared with enough of their forces, just as the Eldar had done on the Exodite World of Haran (though at a great cost in lives). To this effect Eldrad felt he had no choice and gathered forces from his Craftworld, Ulthwé, and launched an attack on Dabenlar IV. Under Eldrad's command the Eldar struck quickly and overran a small peninsula on the world and repelled constant attacks from the Planetary Defense Force to reclaim it. Growing desperate, the Planetary Governor pleaded for aid - and it was answered by the Space Wolves and Ultramarines Chapters. Under the command of the Wolf Lord Ragnar Blackmane, the Space Marines attacked the entrenched Eldar on the peninsula.[1a] Though the Space Marines fought ferociously, they were unable to defeat the Eldar, though they were strong enough to defeat the forces of Chaos when the Warp Rift finally opened - just as Eldrad had planned.[1b]

The world was used by the Magister Anakwanar Sek to train his private army, the Sons of Sek. The Sons were his answer to the Blood Pact, in order to further his goal of gaining the title of Archon, taken by Urlock Gaur after the death of Nadzybar at Balhaut. The traitor Imperial Guard General Noches Sturm was taken to Gereon after his capture by Sek's forces, in order for the Imperial mindlock to be removed. He met his end when elements of the Tanith First and Only came to Gereon to kill him. After his death, the Tanith integrated themselves with the resistance until such a point that they could leave. Crusade forces later retook the world in order to investigate a "cure to Chaos."
Pretannis VII	Pretannis VII is a rigid Imperial Feudal World, that was liberated by the Indomitus Crusade's Fleet Secundus Battlegroup Erastus. Afterwards, newly raised Pretannis Regiments joined the Battlegroup and they adopted the factorum-stamped company icon upon their saviours' command Chimera. It was seen as a symbol of divine overlordship and every detail of the icon, was then tirelessly reproduced in tattoos, electrotapestries and medallions.
Uralan	Uralan is the world on which Abaddon the Despoiler found his sword, Drach'nyen during the First Black Crusade.

Skrynne	Skrynne is a Jungle Death World in the The Periphery subsector of the Calixis Sector.[1a] The colonial death world of Skrynne in the Spinward Front has long struggled with Ork infestation. When humanity first discovered the world, there was a substantial Ork presence. After repeated requests for aid, Space Marines of the Storm Wardens Chapter landed upon the planet and performed a thorough cleansing of the xenos population. During the intervening centuries, the Orks have reappeared several times. Each time, the planet’s meagre garrison has overcome the Greenskins and attempted, once more, to completely eliminate the alien threat.[1b] The last of these incursions and cleansings occurred 145 years ago. After the climactic battle and triumph for humanity, huge portions of the northern continent were cleansed with fire and radiation. The poor colony spent virtually all of their reserves with the goal of eliminating the threat once and for all. In the decades since that time, the colony has grown to a world with a population of nearly ten million human souls. Never a rich planet, they successfully tamed portions of the death world’s jungles and managed to stabilise enough agrarian resources that they finally attained self-sufficiency.[1b]
Besos Nine	Besos Nine was the site of a battle between Orks and the Imperial forces of Warmaster Ryse. The Cadian 8th regiment was among the Imperial forces to take part in the battle.
Dyvanakh Dynasty	The Dyvanakh Dynasty is a Necron Dynasty which has only recently fully awoken. Originally awakening from the Great Sleep in early M41 from their Crownworld of Trakonn, the Necrons of the Dyvanakh Dynasty were unable to shake off their hibernation-induced disorientation for nearly five centuries and this made them vulnerable to an assault by a nearby Forge World of the Imperium. Eventually, the Dyvanakh were able to repel the human siege and drive the Imperial forces from their world. Since then, they have been attempting to search for other lost Tomb Worlds of their Dynasty. Thus far they have been unable to make contact with any, as the missing Dyvanakh worlds were engulfed and destroyed by a Warp Storm thousands of years ago.
Novokh Dynasty	The Novokh Dynasty are a Dynasty of the Necrons. Located in Ultima Segmentum, the Novokh march to war in crimson livery echoing the bloody rituals of their past.[2a] The distinctive colour scheme of the Novokh derives from their battle rituals in the time before biotransference. Having slain their enemies in battle, Novokh warriors would daub their faces and arms in the blood of the vanquished, a practice now echoed in the crimson carapaces of their soldiery.[2a] Today, the Novokh are brutal butchers who do not stop until all organic foes have been completely annihilated and are one of the most terrifying Necron dynasties to face. Though initially mellow, upon witnessing blood the warriors of the Novokh will be overcome by their engrams and go into an unstoppable killing frenzy. The Novokh specialize in close combat, utilizing large numbers of infantry and Lychguard. They also do not hesitate to deploy large numbers of Destroyer Cultists.[8a] The territory of the Novokh dynasty is found in Ultima Segmentum, and includes the crownworld of Dhol VI and the active tomb world Draven[2b]. The dynastic symbol of the Novokh represents the six wars of conquest which emanated from the dynasty's original core; this is a simple design of the type often seen in aggressive younger dynasties[2a]. The Novokh Dynasty is currently fighting against numerous Ork hordes. Since the formation of the Great Rift, they have begun a campaign against the forces of both the Imperium, Orks, and Chaos within Imperium Nihilus including the Wars of Steel.
Phagir	Phagir is a Dead World in the Calixis Sector. It was an Agri World but was ravaged by a genetic virus.
Fornax Aleph	Fornax Aleph is a Hive World in the Sabbat Worlds. One of several planets targeted for reconquest during Operation Newfound, the second phase of the Sabbat Worlds Crusade, the Imperium's encounter with Fornax fully illustrated the bizarre aspects of fighting in a sector exposed to the influence of Chaos for so long.[1a] The assault force, under the command of General Jater Elbeth, arrived on the 303rd day of 757.M41, but met no resistance whatsoever. In fact, the world was entirely devoid of life, human or animal. Within the deserted hive cities, the Guard forces found half-eaten meals and half-finished letters, but no damage, no signs of combat, and no bodies. As far as could be determined, the planet's several million inhabitants had simply vanished.[1a]
Chemos	Chemos was the Homeworld of the Emperor's Children Legion. It is a bleak, unforgiving world, warmed by two small stars and surrounded by a nebula dust cloud. This puts the planet in a perpetual grey twilight. Chemos was settled long ago as a mining world but was isolated from its neighbours by Warp Storms during the Age of Strife. The problem was that the resources of the planet were running out. The planet was not producing enough food even for its own population. Eventually, it fell to a group of fortress factories to produce all the resources. All people had to work every hour of the day, working the vapour mines and synthesisers. Recreation, art and leisure were sacrificed for survival. Because of the nebula clouds surrounding Chemos, it experienced neither day or night but was in a perpetual grey haze. When Fulgrim crashed into the planet, he was taken in by one of the planetary police. He grew quickly and within fifty years he was ruler of the planet. Fulgrim managed to get the planet going again, re-opening old mines and farms. Resources started flowing through the planet again. It continued to grow after the Emperor arrived and re-opened trade in the sector. The Fortress Monastery of the Emperor's Children was located at the centre of Callax, one of the major cities on Chemos.
Theld	Theld is a ferociously volcanic Imperial Death World, that is controlled by the Adeptus Mechanicus and contains pressurized deposits of Moonsilver and Adamantine. These materials are so rare and valuable that the Mechanicus has sacrificed billions of Imperials to their ongoing extractions. Theld was created by the Games Workshop employee Andy Clark and appeared in White Dwarf 481.
Olama	Olama is an Imperium world that was brought into Compliance by the Space Wolves Legion during the Great Crusade.
Forgotten Sons (Short Story)	The planet Bastion must decide whether to remain loyal to the Emperor, or side with the rebel Horus. The Warmaster's case is presented by an iterator, a master of persuasion. The Imperium has sent the Space Marines. Heka'tan and Arcadese must set aside their warlike natures and learn to be diplomats, or risk losing the world. But Horus wants the world, and a plan is in motion to ensure that the Space Marines fail in their task... Two loyalist Space Marines, Heka'tan of the Salamanders and Arcadese of the Ultramarines, arrive on the planet Bastion which has remained neutral in the civil war to act as the Imperium's ambassadors.[2b] Their landing ship is shot down, and they along with human ex-remembrancer Persephia are the only survivors.[2a] Arriving in Bastion's capital city on foot[2b], they surrender their weapons and stand against Horus's ambassador Vorkellen in the city's court.[2c] Arcadese tasks Persephia with retrieving their weapons in case things go wrong, but she stumbles across a single Iron Warrior conducting sabotage beneath the city and is killed.[2d] Heka'tan leaves the debate to check on her[2e] and kills the Iron Warrior after finding her corpse[2f], but meanwhile Arcadese loses his temper in the debate chamber[2e] and the governors of Bastion prepare to side with Horus. At the last minute Heka'tan and Arcadese foil an assassination attempt on Vorkellen[2f] by a lacrymole shape-shifter who shot down their ship and was hired to implicate the Imperium in underhand dealings[2g], but Bastion begins to come apart as nuclear bombs primed by the Iron Warrior start to detonate beneath the planet's crust in a plan to intimidate planets into joining Horus by showing the consequences of courting the Imperium.[2h] Arcadese and Heka'tan hunt down and kill the lacrymole[2g] and escape with the surviving dignitaries to Vorkellen's ship, but the landing pad collapses and Heka'tan sacrifices himself to save the enemy ambassador. Flying away from the dying world, Arcadese swears to avenge his death.[2h]
Chrysalis Shipyards	The Chrysalis Shipyards orbit above Arimaspia in the Gothic Sector. During the Gothic War, these Imperial Space Stations were fought over eighteen times between 150. and 153.M41. Controlling shipyards which had the ability to repair and replenish fleets became of paramount importance as the Gothic War continued. At least one of the battles for the shipyards included a Chaos Space Marine invasion which was fought against for over three weeks by Imperial Navy personnel.
Florins	Florins had its male population completely wiped out by Typhus, after he loosed the dreaded Red Flux onto the planet.

Vanishpoint	Vanishpoint is an Ice World that the T'au Empire is preparing to invade.
Battlefleet Calixis	Battlefleet Calixis is the Imperial Navy Battlefleet of the Calixis Sector, headquartered out of Port Wrath. Battlefleet Calixis officially came into being in 384.M39, a result of the Calyx Expanse being declared conquered by General Drusus during the Angevin Crusade. A half-dozen ships of the line, and a few escort squadrons left over from the Crusade, stayed behind and consolidated Imperial holdings in the area. The Battlefleet was formed from survivors of the conflict against the Chaos-corrupted Yu'vath, a powerful and dangerous Xenos race, and their traitorous human allies. Though they had taken heavy losses, with the help of the Iron Hands Space Marine Chapter, the Battlefleet emerged victorious over their foes and set to work to create a loyal and profitable subsector, protecting innumerable convoys of migrants from pirates over several centuries.[1a] In 467.M39, the planet Valon Urr in the Golgenna Reach subsector was attacked by a coalition of ork freebooterz. Four ships of the Battlefleet, led by Admiral Lightman-Kapes commanding the Fire of Heaven, responded to the astropathic distress call and barely managed to defeat the orks, however, orbital debris and ork troops on the ground caused such devastation to the planet, that the formerly advanced and civilized world only lasted another 134 years before it was declared a shrine world. This event caused the Battlefleet to change tack, and it became more aggressive in it's patrols of the sector, pulling ships away from convoy protection.[1a]
Zaga IV	Zaga IV is a world of the Imperium. Zaga IV was the site of a battle for the Cadian 8th regiment in M36. Later in 393.M41, during the Macharian Crusade, Lord Commander Solar Macharius personally led his forces to battle on Zaga IV, against Chaos Space Marines. While fighting there, Macharius was struck in the chest by a bolt round that did not explode, and the Crusade's Confessors declared it to be a miraculous sign of the Emperor's grace.
Sygor X	Sygor X is an Imperium world that was successfully defended from an attack from a tendril of Hive Fleet Kraken by the forces of the Imperial Guard, Sisters of Battle and a strike force from the Flesh Tearers. Disaster struck during the battle when the Imperium forces sent to defend Sygor X were deployed within the Indomitable Fortress. It soon came under attack, but it was only when the Tyranids' winged and larger organisms attacked the Fortress that its defenders began to break. Its true downfall though, lay at the hands of the Flesh Tearers; as the Space Marines suddenly all fell to the Red Thirst and in their eagerness to bathe in their foes' blood, they opened the Fortress' gates. What happened next was a massacre, as the Tyranids soon swarmed into the Fortress and the Imperial Guard and Sisters of Battle were forced to fight for their lives, as the Flesh Tearers eagerly clashed with the Xenos. Though the Tyranids were ultimately defeated, the Fortress was left in ruins and when the last of the lifeless Xenos crashed to the ground, it fell besides the bodies of thousands of dead Sisters of Battle and Imperial Guardsmen.
From the Blood (Short Story)	From the Blood is a Flesh Tearers short story written by Andy Smillie. The Stromark System has fallen into rebellion and the sons of Sanguinius have been sent to end the conflict and return the system to the Emperor’s light. On Stromark Prime, the Flesh Tearers descend with their most feared warriors – the bloodthirsty Death Company – to tear the heart from the rebellion. But as the murderous Space Marines rampage through Stromark Prime’s palace, the world’s governor may hold their fates in her hands.

In their pursuit of the Word Bearers Chaos Lord Zymran, Captain Kruger's Ultramarines Company received word that the influence of Chaos, had begun corrupting Belaeno's population. Moving swiftly, the Ultramarines purged the Chaos worshipers and Zymran's Word Bearers, who had corrupted them.
Temperis	Temperis is a Hive World in the Cabulis System, in Segmentum Pacificus. Currently it and the entire Cabulis System are under attack by Waaagh! Gragnatz.
Magogue	Magogue was a former Ocean World of the Imperium, until its industry drained its oceans. This, however, revealed Necron structures, which began to awaken the Xenos sleeping within them. When the Forge World Stygies VIII learned of the Necrons attacking Magogue, it sent its Skitarii forces to aid the embattled world. As the Skitarii gave their lives so Magogue's surviving population could evacuate, their Tech-Priest commanders infiltrated the Necrons' structures in order to help feed their Forge World's constant hunger for Xenos knowledge. However, the Tech-Priests were attacked by the Necron Overlord Trazyn the Infinite and placed within stasis fields, which he would later display in a monument to Magogue's fall to the Necrons.
Kalgrathis	Kalgrathis was the site of a battle between Regiments of the Vostroyan Firstborn and Dark Eldar.[1a] During the battle, General Vogor Vlastan was poisoned by a Dark Eldar assassin and his life was only saved due to the efforts of the Regiments' Medicae and the Adeptus Mechanicus[1a]. However, Vogor's body was left physically ruined by the poison and in order to ensure his survival, he was permanently attached to a life preserving mechanical chair, which allowed the General to continue serving in the Vostroyan Firstborn.[1b]
Icefang	Icefang is the homeworld of the Tigers Argent Space Marine Chapter.
Hyannoth IV	Hyannoth IV is a world of the Imperium. It is known as being home to the Neandor strain of Abhumans.
Tanis (Hive World)	Tanis is a forbidden Dead World of the Calixis Sector. Tanis was a thriving Hive World, when it was visited by a unexplained phenomena in the shape of the baleful Tyrant Star, whose passage brought destruction, madness and death to Tanis. Within a period of weeks, the Tanis System was ravaged, resulting in over two billion dead or missing. The Tanis incident was covered up by the Inquisition and declared a forbidden subject on pain of death. Civil data was later adjusted, so that Tanis never existed in the public record. This event would contribute to the formation of the current incarnation of the Tyrantine Cabal, who are charged with investigating and taking whatever action is necessary to combat the Tyrant Star.
Threfenia's Reach	Threfenia's Reach is an Imperial world that borders the Pariah Nexus, and has become a refuge for Imperials seeking to escape from the Nexus. However shortly after the refugees arrived, they were struck by a widespread outbreak of uncontrolled psychic mutations. Its not known why this occurred, but the Rogue Psykers have now caused the Ordo Hereticus to declare Threfenia's Reach to be Interdicto Extremis. The Ordo's agents have now begun a purgatory civil war, to end the Psykers' threat to the world.
Mezoa XV	Mezoa XV is a world of the Imperium that was raided by the Warp Ghosts Warband in 434.M37.
Sentinel World	A Sentinel World[1a], also known as a Bastion World, is a new classification of Imperium worlds that were introduced by Lord Commander Guilliman in the aftermath of the Great Rift's creation. They are designed to serve as inviolable bulwarks against the horrors besetting the Imperium Nihilus beyond their aegis.[1a]
Stalynthia	Stalynthia is a Mining World of the Severan Dominate in The Periphery in the Calixis Sector. This mining world is arguably the Severan Dominate’s most valuable asset. Though it is incapable of sustaining itself—the world simply cannot produce adequate food for its population—Stalynthia provides almost enough metallic raw materials to fulfil the needs of all of the manufactorums still controlled by the secessionists. As long as they can harvest this planet’s wealth and deliver the ores obtained to other systems, the Severan Dominate is assured of at least some materials that they can commit to their war effort. Stalynthia has a heavily polluted atmosphere, which retains heat to a nearly insufferable degree. Centuries of aggressive strip mining have heavily polluted the planet’s surface and atmosphere. The air is thickly packed with particulates, reducing visibility to only a few metres on the clearest days. At times, conditions can be so severe that surface navigation is entirely dependent upon radar signals—even the brightest of headlights are unable to pierce the densely polluted air.
Vigil (World)	Vigil is a Dead World in the Calixis Sector. The local xenos population was destroyed 5,000 years ago but the planet is still covered in extensive ruins. More recently, the Storm Wardens fought the Xeno Slaugth here during The Cleansing of Vigil. Though the Storm Wardens took heavy casualties, the Slaugth were eliminated from Vigil. Because the local xenos population was destroyed during M36 it can be presumed the Slaugth were not native to the planet.
Dhol VI	Dhol VI is a Necron Tomb World. It is the capital of the Novokh Dynasty. At some point during the Great Sleep, Dhol VI was colonised by humanity. It became a Hive World of the Imperium. However, during the reign of Governor Mendican Harrow, the Necrons woke and the forces of the Novokh Dynasty came to Dhol VI. The Necrons broadcast a message allowing the human inhabitants one solar month to evacuate before descending with their armies.
MG-Dyel	MG-Dyel is an Imperium world.
Sanctus (Novella)	The Relictors are sent by the Inquisition to loot the repositories and libraries of a world on the cusp of annihilation. With the countdown to Exterminatus looming over them, they realise that even the Chaos Space Marines of the dreaded Black Legion are not the worst threat that they will have to face before they can escape, and that their true enemy may lie elsewhere.
Belahaam	Belahaam is a Xenos/Forbidden World in the Calixis Sector.
Nemesor	Nemesor is a prestigious military rank used by the Necrons. They fall under the control of higher ranked Necron Overlords but command more power than standard Necron Lords. The rank involves great military and leadership responsibilities: battlefield commander, high strategist, champion of the dynastic codes, envoy, exemplar and protector of their dynasty.
Mars	Mars, also known as Sacred Mars or simply The Red Planet[7b], is the fourth planet of the Sol system. It is the domain, headquarters, and principal Forge World of the Adeptus Mechanicus.[8a] Mars is the linchpin of the Adeptus Mechanicus and the greatest repository of technical knowledge in the Imperium.[7a][8a] Martian society is highly stratified, with the lowest level consisting of unaugmented Human citizens who labour en masse at simple tasks. Most citizens aspire to gain status by joining the Skitarii. In the process, they will receive their first bionics. Above these menials and soldiers are the ruling order, the Tech-Priests. The planet itself is ruled directly by the Fabricator-General of the Mechanicum.[7b] The ruling body of the Forge World and the entire Cult Mechanicus by extension, is the Synod of Mars (also known as the Great Synod and Martian Synod) and is lead by Fabricator General. Mars is the home of the mightiest fleet in the Imperium, the Battlefleet Solar; above the equator vast space docks float in geo-stationary orbit. Mars serves as the Segmentum fortress of Segmentum Solar, and is the home world of several Titan Legions, including the Legio Ignatum.[8a] Every day trillions of tons of cargo are ferried downwards to the surface or upwards into space to the gigantic orbiting manufactorums by void-lifts.[21a]
Cardinal World	Cardinal worlds are one of the sub-types of the Civilised World classification, and share the same properties such as self-sufficiency and at minimum, a moderate technological level. They are Ecclesiarchy worlds, ruled directly by the Ministorum, with the planetary governor also being a Cardinal. Temples and other religious sanctuaries often cover vast areas of the planet.
Lorin Sigma	Lorin Sigma is an Imperium world that was brought into compliance by Imperial forces led by the Emperor during the early years of the Great Crusade.
Reznor	Reznor is an uninhabited world located in the Chinchare Subsector of the Segmentum Obscurus. It is surrounded by the scattered debris of Starships in decaying orbit; the toxic emissions from thousands of their reactors can be felt on the planet's surface.
Sondheim V	Sondheim V was an Agri-World of the Imperium until it was transformed by M'kar the Reborn into his personal Daemon World. However, his reign would not last long, as Hive Fleet Leviathan soon descended on the world. In the ensuing battle, Carnifexes battled Bloodthirsters in the streets whilst Zoanthropes conducted psychic duels with Lords of Change. The Sky Sentinels Chapter were dispatched to reclaim Sondheim V for the Imperium. But upon seeing the situation they opted to call in Exterminatus instead. A stay of execution was ordered by Grand Master Vardan Kai when he arrived at the planet leading a Grey Knights strike force. The Exterminatus was to be delayed to give enough time for the Grey Knights to capture the Book of Pandegaras, a cursed tome which had given M'kar the power to alter the planet. The Grey Knights made planetfall and made it through the twisted landscape to the temple in which the book was stored, but they quickly became overwhelmed and trapped by both Tyranid and Daemonic forces. Kai contacted the Sky Sentinels fleet and ordered them to bombard the temple site. The Grey Knights' superior armour protected them from the bombardments, but the Daemons and Tyranids were not so fortunate. As the bombing stopped, the Grey Knights evacuated with the Book of Pandegaras whilst the Sky Sentinels began Exterminatus of the planet. When the cleansing of the planet was completed, the Sky Sentinels surrendered themselves to the Grey Knights for mindwipe.
Lorin Alpha	Lorin Alpha is the homeworld of the Fire Angels Space Marine Chapter and contains their Fortress-Monastery, the island-fortress dubbed the Tower Athenaeum. At the dawn of the Great Crusade, a bloody campaign took place on Lorin Alpha, in which Titans of the Legio Audax took part. Аfter that event, the Legio were removed to the training world of Bodt, where the World Eaters Legion was concentrated.[2a] During the Horus Heresy, Lorin Alpha was the site of a major battle between the White Scars and Emperor's Children that saw the traitors victorious with the arrival of a Dark Mechanicus fleet.
Sebastian Thor	Sebastian Thor was the shadowy and ill-defined figure who led the Confederation of Light and the people of the Imperium in the overthrow of the insane High Lord tyrant Goge Vandire. It is conjectured that Thor was a simple preacher born on the world of Dimmamar and little else is known of him before his rise to power. During the Reign of Blood as Goge Vandire was at the head of the Ecclesiarchy, Thor began to proselytize his people and lead them into opposition against Vandire. Vandire dispatched a fleet to crush the rebellion and kill Thor, but the fleet was wiped out by a warp storm that came to be known as the Storm of the Emperor's Wrath, suggesting that the Emperor himself was aiding Thor. After this, the Imperium erupted into rebellion against Vandire. Thor soon began a crusade to Terra, attracting several Space Marine chapters and the Adeptus Mechanicus to support him. After Vandire's defeat, Thor worked closely with the Fabricator-General of the Adeptus Mechanicus as well as Space Marine Chapter Masters in restoring the rule of law to Terra and reforming the Imperium so that a madman like Vandire could never rise to power again. The allies put Vandire's lackeys on trial and executed those found guilty, restored the High Lords of Terra, and worked with the Inquisition to end the Assassin Wars of Vindication. However, the position of Ecclesiarch remained empty, and many thought Thor to naturally be its next position holder. However, to the shock of all, Thor refused as he was too busy preaching the Imperial Cult on the northern rim of the Galaxy.
Skorgulian	Skorgulian is a Forge World in the Calixis Sector.
Ur-Haven	Ur-Haven is a place known to have depot yards where Bulk clippers of the Isolde pattern come from.
Black Reach	Black Reach (possibly Blackreach) is a large Hive World located in the south of the Ultima Segmentum, not far from the planetary realm of Ultramar and the Ultramarines homeworld of Macragge.[Needs Citation] It is probably best known for the incident known as the Assault on Black Reach in 855.M41, in which Waaagh! Zanzag descended on the planet and was eventually defeated by the Ultramarines' 2nd Company, under Captain Cato Sicarius. This article needs work on its citations.For help on citation see the citation guidelines. You can help Lexicanum by fixing it.
Krajnov	Krajnov is an Imperial world, that was invaded by the Dark Eldar in M42. The Iron Hands later came to the world's aid and slaughtered thousands of the Xenos.
Moriorum	Moriorum is the Homeworld of the Dark Eagles Space Marine Chapter.
Virus Bomb	Virus bombs are potent weapons of mass destruction, and were commonly used to carry out Exterminatus in pre-Heresy times. In this role they have largely been superseded by Cyclonic Torpedoes, however virus bombs are still retained by some Imperial arsenals. Virus bombs were used on Isstvan III at the start of the Horus Heresy by Horus to destroy the Space Marines who remained loyal to the Emperor. Virus bombs were used to execute exterminatus as late as 273.M41 on the Stalinvast hive world. The viral payload of a Virus bomb can be keyed to specific gene-codes, specifically targeting aliens, mutants or even rebelling humans with a predominant hair colour. The Life-Eater Virus, as used on Isstvan III and Stalinvast, is terrifyingly voracious, capable of spreading across the entire surface of a planet in a matter of minutes. The virus can penetrate power armour and rebreathers. The virus quickly rots and breaks down anything of biological origin, reducing it to sludge. Jungles and forests quickly rot into lakes of sludge. The rapid breakdown of organic matter releases tremendous amounts of flammable gas. The gas eventually ignites, either on its own or with the intentional insertion of an incendiary device, into an apocalyptic, planet-wide firestorm, searing the planet's entire surface to bare rock, as well as burning the atmosphere of all oxygen.
Volcano Cannons	The Volcano Cannon is amongst the most powerful ground-based laser weapons used by forces of the Imperium of Man, unleashing terawatts of energy in a blazing white laser beam which produces a thunderous crack and tremendous recoil. This long-ranged weapon is capable of slicing off a Titan's limb[1a] or killing an enemy war engine with a single shot, though even a Warhound Scout Titan with intact Void Shields can survive a direct hit. Its firepower is similarly stupendous against lesser targets, reducing a Razorback to nothing more than a blackened scorch mark and utterly vaporizing a thick hundred meter-tall iron gate as though it never existed. Volcano Cannons are manufactured in small numbers on just a handful of Forge Worlds in addition to Mars. These included Estaban III, Phaeton and Gryphonne IV, all of which are surrounded by formidable Imperial defences.[11a]
Jagram	Jagram's artificial moons have been Quarantined by the Imperium.
Black Lake	Black Lake is an Imperium Agri World.
Kaurava II	Kaurava II is the second planet of the Kaurava system that is highly known for its food industries. Its northern continent is a harsh, forbidding land, while its southern continent is more settled and peopled. The planet was infested with Orks long before the first Imperial presence. Kaurava II has two moons: Irredene and Orridune.
Finreht Three-Seven	Finreht Three-Seven is home to the Finreht Highlanders regiments of the Imperial Guard. It is a savage and mountainous world. The inhabitants are a nomadic people that follow the migratory herds of mountain Grox that were introduced to the planet long ago. They hunt the weaker Grox to eat and trade the tanned skins with other tribes when they have a surplus. According to ancient tradition, once in every five cycles the tribes must tithe a tribute to the Imperial governors who reside in the only permanent settlements, which are huge, walled, palace-fortresses located in the valleys. When the day arrives to pay the tribute, the best shepherds of the tribe must separate a portion of the flock and lead the arduous journey to the distant valleys. The governor will select a portion of these herds for slaughter and distribution throughout the Agrippina Sector, providing food to over-populated planets. Sometimes, the tribe cannot or does not want to pay the demanded tribute; instead the youth of the tribe are recruited into the Imperial Guard.
Goranl	Goranl is an Imperial Hive World, that lies within the Nachmund Gauntlet. The Underhives of its enormous Hive Cities contain lakes of toxic waste and refuse. Their wretched populations dwell in terrible squalor within archipelagos of hovels and shanties, mounted on discarded girders to hold them above the viscous fluids. The Underhives also suffer from brutal gang warfare and as a result of both, almost everyone there dies of sickness or at the gangs' hands. In M42, however, a widespread outbreak of a Nurgle mutation occurred in the Underhives, that resulted in the dead rising once more. The populations of Goranl's upper Hive levels responded by merely having the Underhives sealed off and then posted additional Enforcers to guard the entrances. In time, though, hordes of infected Mutants and Undead broke through the Underhives' entrances and began swarming the Hive Cities. With their Enforcerss and PDF unable to keep them at bay, Goranl's Imperial Commander was forced to sent out a plea for aid. The Sons of the Phoenix serving in the Wardens of the Gauntlet would arrive to help, but by then much of the Hive World's order had been lost. However this did not dissuade the Space Marines and the Sons attacked the hordes with unremitting fury. They refused any respite, in order to maintain their momentum and as the Sons advanced, holy armies of men and women, singing the Emperor's praises, followed them. Together, this great host of crusaders began putting Goranl's infected Underhives to the torch. Such was their infectious faith, that many of the Hive World's exhausted Enforcers and PDF troops spontaneously joined them, with renewed zealous energy. With the Sons of the Phoenix leading the way, Goranl was purged of the Mutant and Undead hordes that had threatened it.
Fortress	Fortress is the homeworld of the Crimson Paladins Chapter.

Victrix Sonora	Victrix Sonora is a planet along the Trail of Saint Evisser. During the remanifestation of the Daemon Prince Ghargatuloth, elements of the Grey Knights assisted the local Adeptus Arbites in destroying a Chaos Cult that was linked with the daemon.[1a][1b]
Devlan	Devlan is a Mining World on the Eastern Fringe.[1a][1b] In some year of the second half of M41, an unidentified xenos vessel entered the Devlan System and was immediately destroyed by Imperial Navy system defence ships. This incident was perceived with astonishment and some degree of apprehension amongst the officers of the Navy hierarchy. The appearance of an unknown race capable of moving in interstellar space was a danger to be reckoned with. Therefore, studies were conducted by Adeptus Mechanicus Genetors who, after examining the xenos DNA remaining from the explosion, found that intruders were a xenos species discovered by the Imperium in M35; at that time they were identified as harmless, but had somehow developed the capability of reaching other stars in less than six thousand years. This was the first documented contact of humanity with the 'new', developed T'au race. Later, Devlan was invaded by the tyranids of Hive Fleet Kraken. An extensive system of Novastorm space stations around Devlan held back the tyranids long enough for rescue freighters carrying millions of citizens to escape. A company of the Lamenters Chapter was present to hold back the attack of Tyranid Warriors until the last ship was loaded. The Lamenters found themselves surrounded and were finally overrun.[1a]
Hagia	Hagia is a Feudal World[1c] located in the Sabbat Worlds cluster.[1a] It is the birthplace of Saint Sabbat, and the location of her remains.[1f] During the Sabbat Crusades the forces of Chaos attacked the world and mocked the people of the world by calling themselves Infardi, the local word for "pilgrim."[1c] Lord General Lugo was placed in charge of the campaign to retake Hagia from the Infardi. Although the conquest was proceeding ahead of schedule, Lugo was impatient and eager to earn a glorious victory in this morally important planet.[1e] As a result he placed considerable pressure on the Guard officers under his command, most notably, Colonel-Commissar Ibram Gaunt and his regiment, the Tanith First and Only, who were tasked with capturing Hagia's capital city, the Holy Doctrinopolis.[1c][1e] They drove the Infardi out of the Doctrinopolis but at a very heavy cost. The Infardi had left behind a psychic booby trap that the Imperials triggered as they moved in to secure the captured city's Citadel. The trap wiped out an entire brigade of the Brevian Centennials and, to make matters worse, the psychic blast unleashed by the trap acted as an astropathic beacon that drew a Chaos fleet towards the planet.[1f]
Veonid	Veonid is a world of the Imperium used for testing weapons. The planet has suffered from multiple Chaos invasions over the centuries. The First True War of Veonid began in 882.M33 when a legion of Khorne was attracted to the thunder of guns on the world in hopes of battle.

Bray (Planet)	Bray is an Imperial world, located in the Segmentum Obscurus.
Beshic V	Beshic V was a Forge World that was defended from heretics by the 88th Cadian Mechanised Infantry, one year prior to their deployment on Kathur.
Phorus	Phorus is the outermost of the seven planets of the Signus Cluster.[1a] Formerly an Imperial Ice World colony of roughly 90.000 citizens, it was conquered and transformed into a Daemon World sometime before the events of the Signus Campaign.[1a][1b] It was left quarantined alongside the rest of the system after the campaign was finished.[1c]

Kalidar IV	Kalidar IV (also known simply as Kalidar[1e]) is an Industrial World of the Imperium. It is the designated Capital World of the Kalidar System, and of the Kalidar Subsector as a whole.[1a] Kalidar IV used to possess oceans, but these all dried up many millennia before M41.[1c] Now the planet is largely covered in treacherous red-grey desert.[1a][1c][1e] The surface temperature fluctuates wildly, the radiation levels are high, the wind is fierce (standing outside without protective gear can easily result in blindness and dustlung from the razor-sharp sand) and many seemingly safe areas of the deserts are actually covered in swiftdust capable of swallowing a tank. In addition the interaction of the Kalidar sun's radiation with the planet's magnetosphere means that electronic communication (including vox) is unreliable at best and practically impossible at worst.[1c][1d] The planet's main industry is mining, specifically the mining of a psychically active crystalline mineral called lorelei, but its harsh desert climate prevents further development and life is hard.[1e]
Venus	Venus is an Imperium Industrial World that lies near Terra in the Sol System. Originally its abundant volcanism and thick atmosphere made it uninhabitable, but it was terraformed at some point before the rise of the Imperium. There are deep cloud hives on this planet. During the Great Crusade, Venus was dominated by War Witches who fielded armies of Litho-Gholem. The early Iron Warriors Space Marine Legion led the conquest of Venus during the Mehr Yasht campaign.
Hazhim	Hazhim is an Imperium Hive World[1a] that contains deep-space foundries in its orbit.[1b]

Stygia-Aquilon consists of two worlds locked in perpetual orbit around a slowly dying sun. Stygia is a world of fire while Aquilon is a world of ice. Trapped between both is the asteroid base of Darkenvault, which serves as the Fortress-Monastery of the Executioners.
Berin	Berin is a barren planet in the Screaming Vortex, inhabited primarily by Orks. It is a twin world to Asphodel.[1a] Berin is a barren, desert planet of endless plains scoured by winds and bombarded by stellar radiation. Dust storms sweep across is surface with sufficient force to strip even Orks to the bone in moments. Three particular storms, known to the Orks as Ulg, Bur, and Zzuk, rage perpetually and are exceptionally strong. These storms sweep across the planet's surface, devastating everything in their path. Each is a thousand kilometres wide, and they often clash together.[1a] Berin's plains are home to large populations of wild Squigs, which have evolved into numerous species due to the radiation of Berin's sun. These include the multi-legged Racer Squig and the bloated, gas-filled Balloon Squig.[1a]
Vorgundreel	Vorgundreel is an Agri-World of the Imperium. Post-Great Rift, a mission of the Order of the Sacred Rose was driven from its sanctuary by a tide of Cultists. The surviving Sisters of Battle, overcome by the shame of their defeat, submit themselves to their Canoness for justice. As punishment they are all reduced to the status of Sisters Repentia and lead the counterattack to retake the world. The Sisters are slain to the last, restoring their honor in death.
Brimlock	Brimlock is an Imperial world best known for its Imperial Guard Regiments, the Brimlock Dragoons.
Yngirheim	Yngirheim is an Ice World and a current war zone for the Tau Empire.
Cemetery World	Cemetery worlds, sometimes referred to as Burial Worlds, are an Imperial world classification somewhat akin to Shrine worlds, where in cemetery worlds large areas of the planet are given over to care for the dead. Cemetery worlds may mark the site of a huge battle, or they may be covered in gigantic mausoleums, each dedicated to a particular Imperial noble. In contrast, rare cemetery worlds may be covered in fields of endless modest plots containing the remains of the inhabitants of a nearby hive world. This article purports to rely on sources which are not cited in the body of the text.For help on citation see the citation guidelines. You can help Lexicanum by fixing it.
Manzipor	Manzipor is a Civilised World of the Imperium, notable for being the homeworld of Ibram Gaunt. The Gaunt family home was located on the top of Mount Resyde, giving the young Ibram spectacular views of the waterfalls that cascaded down into the Northern Rift and, on clear days, the enormous Lanatre Fields spaceport.
Chalimnus V	Chalimnus V was once infected by a Genestealer Cult, but when they began an uprising the Cultists were attacked by the Word Bearers. Bellowing that the world belonged to the Chaos Gods and not Xenos filth, the Word Bearers then purged the Genestealer Cult from Chalimnus V's surface.
Kralos Prime	Kralos Prime is currently being searched by a Dark Angels strike force, as it is rumored the world contains members of the Fallen. Kralos Prime was created by the Games Workshop employee Tom O'Toole and it was featured in White Dwarf 489.
Fulgor II	Fulgor II is an Imperial Industrial World, that is currently being invaded by the Raptorous Flayhost of the Daemon Prince Jago. The Night Lords Warband had originally targeted the world's precious sorceresses, but this changed when they discovered Fulgor II was infested with a swarming Genestealer Cult. They then quickly changed their priorities, as the Flayhost's need to sate their bloodlust and commit torment, had them begin attacking the Cultists.
Bubonicus (Planet)	Bubonicus is a Daemon World within the Eye of Terror, ruled over by the Daemon Prince known as Bubonicus. Bubonicus has shaped his world into one of pestilence and death, covered in boiling lakes of blood from which spheres of fire float into the sky and spread their light across the firmament.[1a] This corrupt world is famous for its vast prayer gangs. The planet's equator is surrounded by a dancing human chain, that sings and dances the praises of Nurgle as they circle the planet. As they dance, the revellers slowly develop Nurgle's Rot, causing them to eventually mutate into Plaguebearers. When this happens the Plaguebearers leave to join their master and new mortals take their place so that the circle is always complete. This theatrical conceit pleases Nurgle tremendously, so much so that Bubonicus has commanded that the dance should never cease.[1b]
Rentyr Prime	Rentyr Prime was the site where an Ultramarines strike force, led by Captain Cato Sicarius, defeated a horde of Orks.
Uralek Prime	Uralek Prime was an Eldar Exodite World, but has been taken by the Imperium. In their first action as a newly-created Chapter, the Crimson Fists defended an Imperial colony on Uralek Prime from a substantial force of Eldar Exodites that once lived on the world. This allowed the Imperial colony to flourish into a world-spanning civilization.
Karrik	Karrik is a Death World of the Imperium, located in the Calixis Sector. Also known to spacefarers as the 'Pocked World', Karrik is the only planet of its system. It supports a small population of human and abhuman colonists, despite the world's harsh conditions: the low surface temperature, higher-than-Terran-standard gravity, regular asteroid bombardments and moderate Orkoid infestation. Many years prior to Karrik's discovery by the Imperium, an Ork vessel crash landed on the planet. As a result, Karrik is infested with various Orkoid bioforms - Feral Orks, along with Gretchin and Squigs. Fortunately for the Imperium, the cold conditions on Karrik have largely prevented the Orks' development. Regular patrols armed with heavy flamers are able to keep fungal growth in check, and thus far the Orks have been relatively easy to deal with. The presence of the Orks ensures that civil conflicts are rare on Karrik, and has also resulted in a large number of people on Karrik being adherents of Monodominant philosophy.
Byssta	Byssta is a Death World visited by Koulick Krieg.
White Dwarf February 2020	White Dwarf is Games Workshop's premium Warhammer magazine, packed with amazing content each month such as new rules and background, short stories, regular columns, special guests and more.

Piscina IV	Piscina IV is an Imperial mining planet that was the site of a Dark Angels stronghold. Though controlled by the Imperium, Piscina IV is in a state of constant battle with Orks. Each time the Orks seem to be defeated, the Imperial Guard Regiments stationed on the world come under fire at a different place. The Orks tend to shelter in abandoned mine heads and dig themselves in until they attain sufficient numbers to overwhelm the Guard troops sent to cleanse the area. In recent years, the Dark Angels' stronghold on Piscina IV has been visited more and more infrequently by the Tower of Angels, only coming once a generation or so to take aspirants gathered from the barbaric world of Piscina V for further testing and modification.[Needs Citation] Piscina IV was also the site of a great battle during the Third War for Armageddon.
Tysseris	Tysseris is a Imperial world located in Ultima Segmentum near the Ghoul Stars. It is filled with teeming jungles and was once the site of a campaign against Togoran Bloodreeks fought by Imperial forces, among them several Adeptus Astartes Chapters (including the Death Spectres) as well as elements of Adepta Sororitas.
Iron Resolve (Novella)	Iron Resolve is a Mordian Iron Guard novella by Steve Lyons. "Iron Resolve is a tale of the Mordian Iron Guard – in which their famous stoicism and discipline under pressure are sorely tested. A command post/field hospital in an alien forest is besieged by a feral Ork horde. The garrison, woefully undermanned – many having been invalided away from the front lines – have to hold out through the longest night of their lives."
Vespid (Planet)	Vespid is the homeworld of the Vespid species. It is a member of the Tau Empire. Vespid is located three light years from the Sept world of D'yanoi. Vespid is a Gas giant with dark violet-hued skies, filled with continuous and violent storms. Most of Vespid is uninhabitable. However the stormy stratosphere provides a thin layer that can sustain life. In the upper layers float islands of rock. These islands float due to the lighter gases trapped within them. These islands tend to be cone-shaped with flat tops, the lighter gases collecting at the top and valuable crystal formations (the basis of Vespid technology) toward the bottom (which only the larger female Vespids have the constitution to reach and harvest these crystals). The Vespid tunnel out these islands to form their living spaces. Some Vespid, however live lower and higher in the atmosphere.
Phobian	Phobian is the homeworld of the Dark Hunters Space Marine Chapter. It is described as a dark world.
Karnax 17	Karnax 17 was the site of a battle for the Space Wolves (presumably - against Orks), where Wolves suffered heavy losses - at least three entire packs.
Elysian Drop Troops	The enemy commanders think themselves safe form the Emperor's Wrath behind kilometers of fortifications and legions of warriors. They did not account for us. Make your peace with the Emperor men -- we drop in two minutes. The Elysian Drop Troops are Imperial Guard Regiments known for their rapid deployment capabilities, often deploying by rappelling or grav-chutes from Valkyrie Airborne Troop Carriers at high altitudes. These drop regiments are able to strike deep into enemy territory, specialising in ambushing the enemy or capturing important objectives, and can operate for extended periods of time without resupply. The Elysians come from a verdant world some thirty light years from Armageddon, towards the galactic hub. The Elysia system and surrounding wilderness space is notorious for its marauding Ork warbands and pirates, as a main trade route through the sector passes through Elysia, and the system's many swirling gas clouds and hundreds of asteroid fields provide perfect ambush sites. Through combating this ever-present threat, the Elysians are therefore well trained in ship-to-ship boarding actions, and fighting in concert with orbital support when attacking isolated pirate bases.[8a][9a]
Eorak	Eorak is an Imperial world that is infested with Feral Orks, that have begun attacking a small Space Marine fortress located on the world.
Kaurava system	The Kaurava system is a star system located in the Lithesh Sector of the Ultima Segmentum. Comprised of multiple planets, it was under the control of the Imperium, until it was conquered by the Orks under Warlord Gorgutz 'Ead 'Unter,.
Wheel of Fire	The Wheel of Fire is a subsector of Imperial space otherwise known as Eastern Spiral Subsector 4. It was originally the site of a massive campaign between the Space Wolves and Orks during the Great Crusade but presumably lost to time. Long thought to be inaccessible due to surrounding warp storms of notable violence, a stable warp-route into it was finally discovered in the year 981.M41 by the Navigator Durlan Ocellati. Having been cut off from the Imperium for millennia, it was divined that a large force of the Space Wolves Space Marine Chapter should investigate and cleanse the subsector of any threats. This mission was accomplished after a five year crusade, ending in 987.M41. The Wheel of Fire was originally conquered by the Space Wolves during the Great Crusade, in which a third of the Legion was destroyed.
KailithLammas	The planet Lammas was the site of the Lammas Campaign — a series of battles between the Imperium and Eldar tha
Shodrax	Shodrax is an Imperial world and due to the skills of its warriors, it has become a favoured recruiting ground for the Imperial Guard.
Ghinga	Ghinga is a War World of the Imperium. Ghinga is currently fighting an uprising by a Chaos Cult, with the aid of Daemons, that has nearly overthrown the Imperium's rule on the planet. The cult is currently surrounding the Imperial Residency of the Planetary Governor, but due to his quick thinking a blow has been dealt to the Cult's leadership. With the Cult trying to break their way into his Residency, the Governor bowed to their demands to meet with him. There in his audience hall the Cult's leaders began to discuss the terms of his surrender, but the Governor quickly angered them, when he demanded they surrender to him instead. Just as he was about to be killed by a Bloodthirster the Cult had summoned, a squadron of Grey Knights teleported into the room, catching the Cult's leaders by surprise. Unknowingly to the Cult, the Governor had been contacted earlier that the Grey Knights were in orbit to aid his planet; and quickly agreed to lure the Cult's leadership into the audience hall - an area the Grey Knights would be able to safely teleport to. With his part in the plan complete, the Governor quickly left the audience hall, as the Grey Knights easily struck down the Cult's leadership, before engaging the towering Bloodthirster.
Syon	Syon was brought into Compliance by the Word Bearers and Ultramarines Legions during the Great Crusade. After the Compliance, though, the Word Bearers declared the people of Syon to be heathens and launched a purge of the population, despite the Ultramarines arguing vehemently against it. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.
Tranquility-III	Tranquility-III is a Jungle World in the Endymion Cluster at the edge of the Maelstrom Zone. For millennia, it has served as a major base and recruitment world for the Mantis Warriors, who maintain a training facility on the planet dubbed the Valley of the Nine Winds. The world is said to have savage conditions, feral tribesmen, and mega-fauna insects. The planets primitive population worships the Mantis Warriors as their defenders from many threats such as Orks and Pirates.
Paragane	Paragane is an Imperial world, that regressed to Feudalism after it became isolated from the wider Imperium. In time, however, Paragane may return to a higher level of advancement. Paragane was created by the Games Workshop employee Andy Clark and appeared in White Dwarf 481.

The Grey Knights were victorious against the Daemons and drove them back into the Warp, but soon faced an attack from the Bloodgorged Warband. The ensuing battle quickly saw the Grey Knights overrun, as every member of the Bloodgorged they killed brought forth one of the Daemons the Grey Knights had already banished.
Necris	Necris is the homeworld of the Marines Exemplar Chapter.
Valhalla	Valhalla is an Imperial ice world classified as a Civilised World, famous as the home world of the Valhallan Ice Warriors regiments of the Imperial Guard.[8a] When it was first settled, Valhalla was a verdant world of forests and broad fertile plans, a paradise compared to the frozen ice world it would become.[8a] In legends - the only history of the early days of its colonization that survives - Valhalla was a world perfect for human settlement.[Needs Citation] Ten thousand years ago, however, the planet was struck by an immense rogue comet which forever destroyed the paradise of the world.[8a] The defence lasers surrounding the planet blasted the comet with shot after shot, but only succeeded in breaking off fragments of the comet, which was found to consist of almost pure iron. A mile-wide fragment of the comet struck the northern continent, causing great earthquakes and destruction. The main comet hit the vast ocean which spanned most of the planet.[Needs Citation]
Archona	Archona is an Imperial Hive World.
Blood Rite (Novella)	Blood Rite is a novella by Rachel Harrison. Once an idyllic imperial Shrine World, the planet of Luminata has been corrupted by an ancient and hated foe, its inhabitants driven to madness and butchery by the demagogues of the Word Bearers. The Heretic Astartes have come in force to desecrate the holy world and its most sacred treasure: the chalice of Sanguinius, bequeathed to the people of Luminata by the primarch's own hand. Such an affront cannot be borne, and Blood Angels Captain Donato and his archangels descend on the world, determined to cleanse the stain of the traitors. However, the Word Bearers are not the only threat to the noble warriors, for with each step towards the stronghold of Dark Apostle Tur Zalak, the siren song of the Black Rage grows stronger. Caught between the blades of the enemy and the flaw in their blood, only by recovering the chalice and killing the heretics will the angels themselves be saved.
Sulyvan	Sulyvan is a former Agri World of the Imperium. The Chaos Space Marine Kyrus the Chantleader led a daemonic incursion onto the planet, wiping out the Achilus Crusade's forces there. Devoid of all life, Sulyvan has been corrupted into a Daemon World whose landscape changes constantly.
Damnos Incident	The Damnos Incident, also known as the Fall of Damnos, was a battle fought by the Necrons and Imperium in 973.M41 on the Tomb World of Damnos. Used as a Mining World since the time of the Great Crusade, Damnos was rich in resources but only given a small Planetary Defense Force and Imperial Guard garrison. Little did they know that the world had long since been a Tomb World for a sizable Necron army. A year earlier, in 972.M41, tectonic shifts had caused massive seismic shocks that cripped Damnos's geothermic fusion stations, and stirred the Necrons from their dormant state[2a].
Murder	Murder was a Death World inhabited by an arachnid race dubbed the "Megarachnids" by the Emperor's Children and Blood Angels Space Marines that encountered them.[1b] The planet was originally designated One-Forty-Twenty, signifying that it was the twentieth world to be encountered by the 140th Expeditionary Fleet. It was renamed after the last received transmission of Captain Khitas Frome, leader of the Blood Angels company that was the first Imperial force to land on the planet, and was soon wiped out: "This. World. Is. Murder."[1a] Due to atmospheric turbulence, all landings on the planet became disorganized and individual shuttles easily became separated from one another, forcing the Space Marines to fight in relatively small groups while searching for each other. One such group, lead by Emperor's Children Captain Saul Tarvitz, discovered large rock-like structures that resembled dead trees. These "trees" had the bodies of several Blood Angels Space Marines impaled on many of the branches with a flying variant of the Megarachnids feasting upon the bodies.[1a]
The Fall of Medusa V	The Fall of Medusa V was the 2006 global campaign run by Games Workshop. Unlike the previous global campaign, Eye of Terror, the campaign is based only on one planet, Medusa V, much like the Third War for Armageddon campaign. The planet is split into several zones in which results can be posted (see below) and all armies are included in the fighting. The campaign booklet The Fall of Medusa V contains background information on the Medusa system and the various reasons as to why the armies are fighting there. Whatever the result however, Medusa V is going to be swallowed by the warp storm Van Grothe's Rapidity and will be destroyed. The regions of the planet and reasons for the presence of armies are listed below.[Needs Citation] The planet is drawn up in Battle Zones as well as three other uninhabited regions. These are brief summaries of the contents of the zones, for further details see the connecting articles.[Needs Citation] Articus is, as the name suggests, a frozen wasteland for the most part. It contains the Articus Plateau, a large open area of ice, three Hives (Hive Alecto, Hive Amphion and Hive Zethus), as well as an unknown object known as The Separation.[Needs Citation]
Prixetti VII	Prixetti VII is a world of the Imperium.
Praetorian Guard	The Praetorian Guard are Imperial Guard regiments raised from the planet Praetoria. Praetoria is a heavily populated Hive World that lies in a system close to the Imperial naval base at Bakka. The overpopulated Hive cities of Praetoria are renowned for their squalor and degradation, and produce some of the toughest gangsters on any of the hive worlds in the Imperium. This vast population work as little more than slave-labor in the huge factory complexes of Praetoria, producing the goods that have made the planet (and its rulers) one of the richest in the Imperium, with a huge fleet of merchant craft that trade all over the Segmentum and beyond. Imperial Guard regiments raised on Praetoria are renowned for their iron discipline and bravery, even in the face of the most overwhelming odds. The planetary lords of Praetoria hold it is only through fearsome training and draconian punishments for the most minor infringements that the hive-toughened inhabitants of their planet can be made to follow orders and do as they are told. Whatever one's views on the training methods used, they seem to work, producing troops that are as ferocious on the attack as they are determined in defence.
Umbrus	Umbrus is a barren world in the galactic north. Sometime after the 13th Black Crusade, the Iron Hands observed that the Chaos powers heavily fortified the world. The Iron Hands suspected that it guarded a hidden passage through the Cicatrix Maledictum, the Great Rift that separates Medusa and the galactic north from the light of the Astronomican. In rotating shifts, the Iron Hands Clan-Companies brought their armored might to bear, besieging the fortresses that guarded an unusual gateway built into the mountainsides. With no defense able to withstand the pressures exerted by the relentless Iron Hands for long, the heretics’ fortifications fell and their lines broke. The renegades escaped through the mysterious gateway, however, and as the Iron Hands moved to pursue, explosive charges left behind destroyed the portal’s mechanisms.
Marzan	Marzan was once a flourishing Human colony during the Dark Age of Technology, due to the use of a STC system. However, many millennia later, Marzan had since degenerated into a Feudal World and much of its old technology was lost. Agents of the Adeptus Mechanicus, though, believed they had discovered the site of Marzan's STC system, which was now beneath a warlord's castle. In order to gain access to the STC, the Mechanicus agents needed to secure the castle, so they promised aid to a local bandit group in order for the criminals to stir up a rebellion. Once it began, the agents gained control of the rebellion and led it in an assault on the warlord's castle.
Canau	Canau is an Imperium world that was invaded and conquered by Orks. However the Orks were later defeated by the Blood Angels, who were led into battle by their Chapter Master Dante.
Khedd 1173	Khedd 1173 (or simply Khedd[1b]) is a world of the Imperium.[1a] At some point, the Kheddite nomads attempted to rebel against the Imperium. An Astra Militarum taskforce was assigned to pacify the planet and were ultimately successful, with General Aldo Dercius of the Jantine Patricians regiment commanding the assault that killed the leaders of the rebellion.[1a] Dercius's glory would not last, however; shortly after the last battle, a number of Hyrkan Regiments arrived on Khedd. Dercius, thinking that they were simply delayed reinforcements, was confronted by his "nephew", Commissar Ibram Gaunt. Gaunt had learned that his father, Dercius's former subordinate, had been left to be slaughtered by Orks when Dercius made a cowardly withdrawal on Kentaur. Gaunt accused Dercius of cowardice and slew him in an honour duel.[1a] Although Gaunt won the duel, he was badly wounded by Dercius's chainsword, leaving him with a large scar across his stomach.
Xana	This article is being created or revised. Please consider this before you edit this text! Xana was a Forge World of the Imperium.[1a] It was the second planet of the Xana System, leading it to also be referred to as Xana II. After the Heresy it would become known as one of the first Hell Forges.[1c] Its existence rumored by Rogue Traders and explorers from the earliest days of the Great Crusade, Xana was said to have a machine empire held by cyborg overlords and relics of the Dark Age of Technology. Whatever the truth, in 843.M30 the planet was accidentally discovered by Rogue Trader Casilida DeAniasie when she was rescued by a trio of automata warships hailing from the forgeworld.[1a] While negotiations between Mars and Xana began to the Imperium and Mars, Imperial commanders and martian emissaries grew suspicious of such a strongly-established and apparently Cult compliant forgeworld while no link to Mars and no trace of an Ark ever being sent could be found. This paradox was not helped by the Xanites' vagueness about their origins and refusal to give access to their data-loom to the Fabricator-General's ambassadors.[1a] Considering a forceful compliance of Xana might require at least a full Space Marine Legion however, Xana was ultimately allowed to maintain its sovereignty if it armed the Great Crusade and paid lip service to Mars. Its Titan Legions, the Legio Vulturum and the Legio Kydianos soon joined the Crusade in earnest.[1a] During the First Rangdan Xenocide Imperial forces rallied at Xana to turn back the Rangda tide, at a high cost in resources and troops for the forgeworld.[1a]
Phyressian Armoured	The Phyressian Armoured are Imperial Guard Armoured Regiments from the planet Phyressia.
Ephisian Atrocity	The Ephisian Atrocity was an event that took place on the planet Ephisia. The Imperial world had undergone a Imperial Guard founding and as such millions of soldiers and vehicles had mustered on the dust plains outside one of the Hive Cities of the planet. The Alpha Legion however, had infiltrated the mustering with a large number of psykers who rose up and devastated the troops, causing hundreds of thousands of deaths.
Pertinax	The name or term "Pertinax" may refer to:
Zaebus Minoris	Zaebus Minoris is the homeworld of the Red Scorpions Space Marine Chapter and is a small, arid world populated by primitive tribes of humans. The traditions of Zaebus Minoris's tribes tie into the recruitment process of the Chapter. Male infants are presented to the tribes' temple at the first full moon of their lives. A few are taken by the "gods" — selected, after genetic testing, by Chapter Apothecaries as potential future Marines. Because these recruits will have had no experience with their parent culture, the Chapter is all the recruit will know. Chapter Master Carab Culln was inducted from this world.[Needs Citation]
Sacris	Sacris is a Feudal World in the Calixis Sector and homeworld of the Storm Wardens Chapter. Highlands, moors and murky swamplands constitute most of the planet's surface. The planet's satellite, Highcastle, houses the Storm Wardens fortress-monastery. Upon Sacris, many rival tribes of humans wage wars of dominance across the swamplands. Under the command of charismatic warlords, Sacris tribesmen paint their faces with woad and arm themselves with Sacris Claymores, the heirloom weapons of their families, in preparation for battle. To this honourable warrior-culture, a man's word is his bond, a belief that stems from their religious devotion to The Emperor, who they see as a harsh father-figure who judges all men's souls by the strength of their arms and the purity of their honour. Much of the Storm Wardens' ways have been strongly influenced by society of their homeworld. It is not uncommon to see Neophytes of the Chapter sporting woad face-paint on the battlefield, and when Aspirants pass the trails of initiation, they take with them a Sacris Claymore, to be delivered home when they die.
Cuyavale	Cuyavale is a Feral World of the Severan Dominate, currently under invasion by the Orks of Waaagh! Grimtoof. It is covered by temperate rainforests of kilometre-tall trees, which are inhabited by reclusive human tribes.[1a] Cuyavale was originally settled at some point in the unrecorded past before the Great Crusade. It remained in isolation until it was reached by remnants of the Angevin Crusade, whose surveyors were surprised by the discovery of human life on the distant world. After contact was re-established, the Ecclesiarchy sent out missionaries to establish the Imperial Creed among the local tribal societies.[1a] In the modern day, Cuyavale is inhabited by two distinct populations. One is arboreal, living entirely within the canopies of the trees and rarely or ever descending to the ground. Many groups spend their entire lives within the tops of a single grove of trees. These people are often agriculturalists, having domesticated many of the lesser plants that grow on the trunks and limbs of the trees. The other half of the human population is subterraean, and inhabits caves systems believed to have been created by ancient water courses and by long-since decayed root networks of ancient trees. These groups live in perpetual darkness and live off fungus and animals that share their lightless world. They live in constant fear of the planet's predatory Drakons, although their underground homes give them relative safety from the creatures.[1a]
Luxor (Gothic Sector)	Luxor is an Imperial world in the Gothic Sector. In orbit around Luxor is a Space Station operating under an ancient, independent contract to Port Maw. Unlike most Imperial space stations, the contract it runs under makes it independent from the Adeptus Mechanicus and the Imperial Navy. The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here. Luxor is the name of a city in Egypt. Luxor is the site where the ruins of ancient Thebes are nowadays located.

Undred-Undred Teef	Undred-Undred Teef is a collection of systems at the heart of the Accursed Demesne in the Koronus Expanse.[1b] It is heavily infested with Orks and serves them as a nest and breeding ground. It consists of worlds, covered in filth and wreckage, ringed with clouds of debris and junk. Beneath their mantles of scrap and crude defences are worlds poisoned as the result of Ork industry, on which greenskins constantly slaughter one another over looted bitz and competing in constructing weapons, war machines, and even Gargants. From the worlds of Undred-Undred Teef Orks sail to the Expanse in search of booty and raw materials for their growing armies.[1a] Worlds of Undred-Undred Teef include:

Guilliman then made a warrior's bond with the trooper, vowing to return should the world ever need his aid. A temple within the capital city, Erebus, honours this oath, which was also marked by the planet's inhabitants changing its name to include the word "Ultra."
Govina	Govina is a Sept World of the Tau Empire. Due to Govina's lush natural resources and relatively weak military presence, it was targeted for a raid by the Blood Gorgons Warband.

Traders are able to make large sums selling exotic dyes to the Dreahans. More unsavoury merchants have found a ripe market for hallucinogenic drugs, as Dreahans are particularly fond of the bright colours such substances make them see. The Planetary governor is attempting to crack down on this trade, with little success.[1b] 12-317/67/CS/NNE[1c]
Ynnen	Ynnen is a Feudal World of the Imperium.[1b] In the year 111.M38 Ynnen fell to the tyranny of an Enslaver outbreak and took a full eighty Deathwatch Battle-Brothers and two Dreadnoughts to fully eliminate the Warp entities.

Forgefane	Forgefane was an Iron Warriors Fortress World, ruled by Warsmith Kolvax until its fall to Hive Fleet Leviathan during their 997.M41 invasion. Forgefane boasted some of the most formidable defences ever seen: massive citadels and bastions covered the landscape, each protected by miles of trenches, mine fields and razorwire as well as void shields and vast quantities of ordinance. The planet also garrisoned an entire Grand Company of Iron Warriors, including Chaos Titans and Defilers. Forgefane's defences were more than adequate to stop the initial Tyranid landings with flak batteries, warp-powered laser batteries, killing fields and miles of trenches and mines even stopping multiple assaults by Bio-Titans, Gargoyles and Harridans. It wasn't until the Hive Fleet launched attacks from beneath the fortress, using Trygons to tunnel into the fortresses followed by hordes of gaunts, that the fall truly began. These underground assaults broke supply lines and isolated defences, even managing to annihilate over 600 Defilers in a couple of hours. Shortly after, the Fortress World fell.
Jubal (planet)	Jubal is an Imperial world, located in the Chinchare sub-sector of the Segmentum Obscurus.
Typhon Primaris	Typhon Primaris is a Dead World located in Subsector Aurelia, and was once one of the recruiting planets for the Blood Ravens Space Marine Chapter. Typhon Primaris was world dominated by jungles and swamps. Even before becoming infested by Orks and Tyranids, its harsh envionment was adverse to humans.[2a] Typhon Primaris was settled by humans during the Dark Age of Technology. At the time of the Fall of the Eldar, a fatally damaged Aeldari Craftworld crashed on the planet; it eventually became buried under the earth and vegetation. Meanwhile, the human population technologically regressed to a state comparable to the Bronze Age, while Orks arrived to battle the humans. A small number of Aeldari Exodites also settled on the world, unknowingly attracted to the dead Craftworld.[2a]
Incaladion	Incaladion is a Forge World that lies near Dragon's End, the Homeworld of House Griffith. The Forge World was incriminated in a conspiracy involving techno-heresy and worship of Xeno-law. It was also originally the Homeworld of the Legio Fureans, before their fall to Chaos.[2b] Founded by a Mechanicum Sleeper-Ark during the Age of Strife on a world rich with an abundance of rare mineral resources, its Warp currents brought many dark and Xenos invaders, creating a warlike Magos leadership amid the incessant wars and invasions. The world was ruled over by a Preceptor-General with the Legio Fureans as their enforcers.[2b] The Forge World was liberated by the Iron Warriors during the Great Crusade. During the protracted Siege of Incaladion, nearly 30,000 Space Marines were lost, devastating the Iron Warriors Legion.[2a]
Moredakka	Mordax Prime or Mordax was a Forge World of the Imperium that was invaded during the 13th Black Crusade. Captured during the Green Kroosade, it is now an Ork World called Moredakka and infested with Deathskull lootas and survivors report of hundreds of Gargants being built all across the planet. During the invasion, the Chaos Cruisers Bloodshrike, Cackling Hate and Azrubael broke through a running battle with the Imperium's forces near Mordax Prime, and on Abaddon's orders bombarded its major cities for two hours. The attacks, which were aimed at terrorizing the populace and severing the Imperium's supply lines, caused millions of deaths. White Dwarf 287 (UK) states this world as being part of the Thracian Primaris System, but this is a mistake. Battlefleet Gothic: Armada (Book), a later White Dwarf 291 (UK) and the 2003 Eye of Terror Worldwide event all place the world within the Scarus Sector, but outside that system.
Planetary Defense Force	Planetary Defence Forces (PDF for short, also known as Planetary Defence Militia, Planetary Militia[9a] or Planetary Guard[9b]) is a term referring to the primary military defence forces of an Imperial world. The PDF is under the control of the local government rather than direct Imperial control: the raising, training, arming, leadership, etc, is entirely in the hands of the Imperial Governor. All Imperial planets in general are required to maintain a standing army in order to maintain government (and thus Imperial) control over the planet against any possible invasion or insurrection.[Needs Citation] In response to any threat, the PDF has the responsibility to engage the enemy until Imperial reinforcements can be mustered from the nearby sector. Thus although rarely respected due to their inherent lack of experience, PDF are widely considered crucial to the Departmento Munitorum as the first line of defence for Imperial worlds against Xenos invasion and Chaos-inspired rebellion.[Needs Citation]
Mordriana III	Mordriana III is a world of the Imperium, near the Eye of Terror. The tribes of feral humans on the planet are in a perpetual state of war with each other.

Part of each noble family's obligation is to send at least one of its scions to serve in the PDF, where they serve a minimum five years training and fighting throughout the system and its environs. The best are recruited from these chosen companies for service with the Imperial Guard. To have a son or daughter chosen for service is considered a great honour and each noble house maintains its own detailed records of the heroic feats of its ancestors. The enormous hall of heroes of Jouran also contains records of all of those who have served in the regiments, as well as the actions of all the tithed regiments of Jouran.[Help] Jouran III is a hot and industrialized world from which the majority of the regiments' manpower is recruited. It is also home for the factories producing the bulk of the Jouran Dragoons' equipment and vehicles.[Help]

This is the story of two blades, spears crafted by the hand of the Emperor Himself in the days long before the birth of the Imperium. Linked, equal but opposite, these blades are destined to be wielded by two of the greatest heroes of the Age of Darkness. And as the spears themselves, Appolonian and Dionysian, are equal and opposite, so too are those to whom they were gifted. This is their story too. The warrior-scholar, a savant and a servant. The warrior-king, a savage and a soldier. Their fates entwined in ways they do not understand, they carry the blades as both gift and curse, fulfilment of destiny unseen by any save the Master of Mankind.
Dunroamin VI	Dunroamin VI is an Imperial world located in a region of the Ultima Segmentum with many Mining Worlds. During a time of increased pirate activity in the region, the ruling Planetary Governor of Dunromain VI was one Fraser Mackenzie, Grand Duke of the ancient colonial family Clan Mackenzie. Over time, questions were raised as to how Dunroamin VI had escaped predation at the hands of the pirates who had been raiding their neighbours and rivals in industry, the Mining Worlds of Rouan and Nearly-There. It soon became clear that Clan Mackenzie was financing the pirate raids and buying the goods stolen from their neighbours. An Eversor Assassin was sent to Dunroamin VI with orders to kill not only the Grand Duke but every one of his living relatives. The Eversor struck during the Clan's annual Grand Hootmanay festival, and by the end of the night had succeeded in killing Fraser Mackenzie, his youngest relative of three weeks old, his eldest relative of one hundred and forty two, and all three hundred and fourteen other members of his extended family. During the night the Eversor resorted to all sorts of improvised weapons to complete the imposing task, including a butter knife and a silver soup spoon.

Drazak	Drazak, also known as the Bone Kingdom, is a Necron Tomb World located within the Ghoul Stars. Flayed Ones, generally feared and condemned by the rest of Necron society, are exiled to languish in Drazak, and thus largely populate the world. They stalk through its desolate streets, fighting over gobbets of rotting meat and shards of bone. Only one Necron has retained his senses, the Necron Lord Valgul who rules over the planet. Under the command of Valgul, the fleets of Drazak make raids for blood and flesh against nearby worlds in an event known as the Time of Bounty. The orbit around Drazak is filled with the empty ruins of hundreds if not thousands of Necron warships, both from their ancient battles against the C'tan and from more recent arrivals.

Lucid Prime	Lucid Prime is an Imperium planet. In the year 837.M41 the Space Wolves, Angels Vindicant and Flesh Tearers Space Marine Chapters fought on this planet with the goal of defeating Chaos Space Marine elements assaulting Ratspire. The Space Wolves were outraged when the Flesh Tearers started killing the citizens of the Hive. Brother fought brother, and with the death of hundreds on either side, this event was known from then on as Honour's End.
Castigon Prime	Castigon Prime is a world of the Imperium. The world nearly fell to Heresy when it was invaded by the forces of the Nurgle worshiper Atrophus the Foul, overwhelming its defenders. The Imperium tried to retake Castigon Prime, but every battle with Atrophus's forces resulted in unacceptable losses and eventually the order to perform an Exterminatus was given. However, the Virus Bombs used in the operation proved ineffective in killing Atrophus, finally forcing the Imperium to call upon the Grey Knights to end the threat. They descended upon Castigon Prime where they slew Atrophus before cleansing the planet of his forces and any unfortunate Imperium defenders still left alive.
Suranas	Suranas is a Necron Tomb World. Newly awakened from the Great Sleep by 799.M41, it was soon invaded by an Ork Waaagh! under Warboss 'Eadcrumpa. The Necron Lord of the planet, Nepthk, managed to convince the greenskins to leave with a tribute of Doomsday Cannons.
Hranx	Hranx is a War World that the Imperium is trying to reclaim from an Alpha Legion-led Chaos Cult. The Alpha Legion infiltrated Hranx and began organizing a Chaos Cult, which they funded and trained, to overthrow the Imperium's rule on the Hive World. When the rebellion began and Hranx's Planetary Defence Forces were not able to contain it, an Imperium taskforce arrived and destroyed several hives from orbit. The taskforce thought the rebellion was destroyed, but discovered that the Alpha Legion had prepared for such an action and had built a vast subterranean fortress complex called the Pit of the Hydra. In the end, the Imperium's destruction of the Hives succeeded only in creating a no-man's land called the Murder Wastes which divided the lands controlled by the two forces. For ten years, the Imperium had tried and failed to retake Hranx from the forces of the Alpha Legion, but they were constantly thwarted by the Legion's agents, which had infiltrated the taskforce. The agents passed the taskforce's plans to the Alpha Legion and the Cult, which destroyed the forces sent to shatter the Pit of the Hydra. Numerous operations and offensives were destroyed from within, robbing the taskforce of its strength, while the Alpha Legion was safe within their fortress, free from any reprisals from the Imperium. Despite the number of their forces lost, those in command of the taskforce knew Hranx could not be allowed to fall to the Alpha Legion. To do so would give the traitors a gateway for its corruption to spread into other sectors and bring more worlds into rebellion.
Thain	Thain was an Imperial planet before being invaded and probably consumed by a Tyranid Hive Fleet. Thain orbits two suns, and was known for its large grox herds which formed the basis of its economy. At some point, Thain was invaded by Tyranids. The Imperium initially intended to defend the planet, dispatching Astra Militarum forces and an Imperial Navy contingent. The Imperials deliberately destroyed the planet's wildlife and domestic animals, using scorched earth tactics to slow the Tyranid advance. Despite these efforts, they were gradually pushed back by the Xenos invaders. Eventually, the Imperial position detoriated to the point that the battle was considered lost, although this remained unknown to the Astra Militarum garrison. However, the Adeptus Mechanicus dispatched a suicidal mission led by Magos Procrustes to Thain, intending to capture and study a new Tyranid bioform observed on the planet. With support by the Cadian 32nd's Fifth Company, Procrustes achieved his objective and consequently transmitted the data offworld. Afterwards, the Adeptus Mechanicus contingent committed suicide with acid to deny their biomass to the Tyranids, while the Astra Militarum troopers fought to the death.

It was the site of a battle where a Titan Legio fought itself, the two princeps leading each side being sisters where one argued that the Emperor was dead and the other that He had simply abandoned them and the Imperium.

Captain Black of the Catachan MXIV led a strike force against a Pulsa Rokkit, destryying it and a Stompa at the site. The war would then become a stalemate until the Orks' Stompa factory in the Widow Valley was destroyed by Sentinel teams.[1a] Kato has no moon.
Neptune	Neptune is an Imperial world of the Solar system, the system which holds Terra, capital of humanity. An ancient world by Imperial standards, Neptune was first colonized by humanity during the Age of Terra.

In the tunnels of Neptune's Moons, the IXth Legion fought a bloody war that saw 12,000 Battle-Brothers lost. Yet by the time Imperial reinforcements arrive, the Legion still endured and had succeeded in its mission. They had also replenished their numbers by recruiting among many of the dregs of Neptune.
Prol IX	Prol IX is a Hive World of the Imperium.[1a] In addition to being the seat of the Decatalogues of Prol, it is described as an ancient seat of the Administratum.[1b] This crowded, reddish brown world is the current seat of the scholastic order known as the Decatalogues of Prol. Each of the nine planets is given over to record keeping, collation, statistical analysis, archiving and the like. Space is running out on Prol IX, leading to a vicious schism within the ranks of the Decatalogues. The Centurists wish to move to the forbidden tenth planet within the system, whilst the Pyratics wish to destroy the ancient files stored upon Prol I and raise new temples of information from the ashes of the old. Violent debate and long, impeccably researched, treatises are being exchanged between the two factions. These written arguments - some as many as one hundred and six volumes long - are not helping the chronic shortage of space.[1b] The Prol system has stable Warp routes with Dreah and the Scarus Sector.[1c]
Talon	Talon is the abandoned homeworld of the Storm Falcons Space Marine Chapter. In 997.M41 it was absorbed into Hive Fleet Leviathan under the direction of the Swarmlord.

Before its first destruction, Desperation was a hive world, with orbital defence batteries situated in major population centres in an attempt to dissuade enemy fleets from orbital suppression to minimise civilian casualties and damage to infrastructure. Desperation was outside of the range of the Astronomican, but was still linked to the Imperium by utilizing an Astropathic Duct linked to the Astropath Station on Nexus III.

Saint Marduk's Bane	Saint Marduk's Bane, previously known as Colkasth, was a Hive World of the Orpheus Sector. During the Orpheus Revolt in 921.M39, the world became the last bastion of Chaos resistance in the face of an Imperial War of Faith. The Hive World had been fortified into a living hell and its population used as raw materials by the Warpsmiths of the Death Mongers. The Commander of the War Effort, Arch-Confessor Marduk claimed the final victory for his own zealot and Imperial Guard forces, choosing to instead dispatch the Space Marine and Sorotias allies to destroy other fleeing traitor forces. However, after all contact was lost with the Ecclesiarchy forces, the Angels Revenant Strike Cruiser Intercessor rushed to investigate, only to be attacked by two small xenos craft of unknown origin (likely Necrons). Destroying one attacker and driving the other off, the Space Marine vessel was badly damaged but nonetheless found that the entire world of Colkasth had been reduced to a radioactive wreck. The Angels Revenant discovered a few catatonic survivors on the planet. The Dead World of Colkasth is forever afterwards named Saint Marduk's Bane, after the "martyred" Arch-Confessor himself.

Tranch	Tranch is a Hive World in the Calixis Sector. The planet is most notable for being the site of the infamously brutal mutant uprising known as the Tranch War and for being the birthplace of the Pale Throng Mutant horde.

Thesvor II	The population of Thesvor II had the misfortune of unknowingly living upon a Necron Tomb World. When the Necrons reawakened, the Lord of the mechanical Xenos stated that it was only this ignorance that had saved the lives of the trespassers. The Lord's mercy only extended so far, though, and Thesvor II's population was informed they would have only one solar cycle to leave the world or they would be eradicated by the Necron.
Lagrans Alpha and Beta	Lagrans Alpha and Beta is an Imperial Death World. It has gravitic fluctuations and exotic rad-storms that can crush entire hab-domes. They also regularly reduces Lagrans Alpha and Beta's unlucky Human population to organic sludge.

Lagrans Alpha and Beta was created by the Games Workshop employee Andy Clark and appeared in White Dwarf 481.
Kalmatir	Kalmatir was where the Primarch Sanguinius, once addressed his Blood Angels Legion.

Ligeria	Ligeria is a world of the Imperium.
Grendel's World	Grendel's World was a small, isolated planet located in the Ysobel Cloud deep in the Eastern Fringe. It was a part of the Imperium of Man until the entire population was wiped out by the Night Lords. In the year 843.M34, the planet came under attack by the Night Lords after an initial period of observation. Their primary targets in this first strike were the planet's communications centers, which briefly got out a distress signal before being silenced. Despite their inhabitants being slaughtered in an orgy of violence, these centers were left completely unharmed by the Night Lords for their own nefarious purposes. With the planet's communication network seized, the Night Lords began to broadcast looping images, sounds and vid-recordings of savage butchery, blasphemous obscenities and dying screams. They next destroyed the planet's electrical grid and detonated nuclear-scale explosives in uninhabited areas of the planets. The resulting clouds of radioactive fallout blanketed the world in permanent night, causing radiation poisoning and mass panic in the population. The psychological trauma caused by the Night Lords' methods was tremendous. Fourteen percent of the population was estimated to have died from sheer fright, lacking any wounds but having suffered total nervous failure. Another third are thought to have taken their own lives rather than face the Night Lords once they began their "sport" of hunting down the survivors. The slaughter lasted for weeks, until every last man, woman and child was dead and their corpses profaned with the Night Lords' sigils.
Kruun	Kruun was a world in the Nostramo Sector, destroyed in 012.M31 after a Khrave infestation. Kruun was a stronghold of the Night Lords Legion in the Nostramo Sector.

Praetoria	Praetoria is a Hive World in Segmentum Tempestus and homeworld of the Praetorian Imperial Guard. Located near the Segmentum Tempestus Naval Base at Bakka, the Hives of Praetoria are noted for their squalor and degradation where everything, even the air, is rationed and where even the most minor infringement of the law can lead to the most draconian of punishments. The huge population of this world are little more than slave labour in massive factory complexes, and through endless toil and with the aid of a large merchant fleet which trades across the Segmentum, Praetoria - or at least her rulers - are amongst the richest in the Imperium.
Darcia	Darcia is an Imperium world.
Sophano Prime	Sophano Prime is a mining world in the Calixis Sector.

Gland War Veterans	Gland Warriors, also known as Homo sapiens auctus glandulae, are a specialized, genetically modified force of Imperial Guardsmen originally designed to battle the Tyranids. Despite being Human originally, due to the nature of their modifications they are now generally classified as Abhumans by the Imperium at large. Gland Warriors have additional organs which enhance their combat abilities, giving them increased muscle mass, aggression, pain tolerance, and immunity to many lethal toxins. However, these enhancements often result in them being mentally unstable. The glands implanted into these warriors contain the Combat Drugs known as 'Slaught, Frenzon and Spur, which enhance their capabilities in combat, though often at a price. Indeed, Gland Warriors, like any other group who utilize such potent drugs - such as Penal Legions — can die at any time. This most often happens during combat, as their systems are quickly overcome with the drugs dispensed by their artificial glands. They are typically equipped almost exclusively for close combat, with a laspistol, a combat knife and a form of halberd known as a "Dueling Glaive".
Kaurava IV	Kaurava IV is the outermost planet of the Kaurava system. It was on this world that a massive Warp storm erupted, plunging the entire system into chaos and warfare. The planet has two continents (the southern continent is called Parmenie), and a moon called Lacunae.

In 939.M41, during a campaign by the 70th Luther McIntyre regiment, Commissar Sebastian Yarrick managed to capture an ork alive. Yarrick was able to learn the Ork language from his captive.
The Six Hour War	The Six Hour War was a battle between the Ultramarines and the Tau in 913.M41. The battle occurred on the planet K'ail close to the Damocles Gulf. K'ail was garrisoned by a strong force of T'au. Captain Severus Agemman performed the perfect operation of his Strike Force Ultra. The battle was won due to a coordinated attack on the T'au defence network and garrison itself. Whilst twenty veterans of the Chapter stormed through the central defence line and Stormraven-borne space marines destroyed the munition cashes around the perimeter of the garrison, Agemman personally led a teleport assault and strike to the T'au command node, which forced the xenos to think that they was surrounded on all sides. As a result, the T'au decided to retreat from the planet.
Jared's World	Jared's World is an Imperium world. It contains an Imperial Guard garrison that receives supplies manufactured on the Industrial World Vrantis III.
The Lathes	The Lathes are a group of three worlds in the Calixis Sector — Hadd, Hesh and Het. All three planets are Forge Worlds located close together in the Golgenna Reach subsector. Their highly irregular orbits result in hyper-gravitic events, allowing the manufacture of extremely high-density ammunition and blades claimed to be unbreakable. The entire system is held in fealty to the Mechanicum of Mars and non-believers require extensive permits from high authorities to visit. The population of The Lathes is estimated to be approximately five billion. The majority of these natives, the menial labourers serving the Adeptus Mechanicus are large men and women, meaty and powerful, with large bones, often described as more Ogryn than man. Following the War of Brass, the Skitarii Legions of the Lathe Worlds forces were greatly diminished. With only a wounded Legio Venator to protect them, the Mechanicum of the Calixis Sector were suddenly vulnerable. In response High Fabricator Kovikal Quietus set about discreetly drafting a new fighting force. Consisting of veterans and the most promising recruits, this new elite fighting force dubbed Venatorii would be equipped with advanced integrated weapons powered by a Potentia Coil and armoured in heavy crimson carapace armour, forged in the peculiar gravity of the Lathe Worlds. This armour has earned the Venatorii the moniker, 'Crimson Guard'. These warriors are an elite fighting force, separate from the Skitarii and have participated in several conflicts including the Meritech Wars. They also been utilised by Mechanicus-aligned agents of the Inquisition.
Sekel's Landing	Sekel's Landing is an Imperium world that was brought into compliance by Imperial forces led by the Emperor during the early years of the Great Crusade.
Sarposia	Sarposia was an Imperial world that featured vast orbital shipyards. However, the world and its shipyards were destroyed in an invasion by Hive Fleet Jormungandr. Though a plea for aid was sent, Battlefleet Gammek did not arrive until Sarposia had already been destroyed, and the Battlefleet met the same fate when it was ambushed by Jormungandr's Bio-ships.
Saharrin	Saharrin is the site of a battle between the White Scars Chapter and the forces of Khorne.
Metalica	Metalica (also Metalicus [Needs Citation]) is a Forge World situated close to the Ork Empire of Charadon. It is home to the Legio Metalica.[1a] The Forge World is close to many threats, such as the Ork Empire of Charadon and the Great Rift. Its endless production quotas see dozens of war fronts kept supplied, while its Skitarii forces are skilled at purging threats throughout the region. Their extreme fervor for mass production has seen the planet scoured of all flora and fauna. Yet every surface of Metalica is covered in industrial production, even its ironclad canyons and subterranean passages. This has led to the claim that the entire planet is made of metal. Metalica stands apart both physically and doctrinally from Mars. The ruling Metalican Magi have long resisted attempts by the Martian priesthood to impose their rule on them. Their troops display only the barest amount of Martian crimson on their heraldry, drowned out in the pure white of Metalica. This is symbolic of the purity of the machine and the inevitable victory over the weak flesh.
Tethris	Tethris was an Imperial world subjected to Exterminatus after being overrun by the Tyranids. Tethris was successfully conquered by an unspecified Tyranid hive fleet. However, while the Tyranids were still harvesting the planet's bio-reserves, a Space Marine fleet materialised from the Warp and destroyed the planet with a barrage of cyclonic torpedoes, fulfilling an Exterminatus order issued by Inquisitor Kryptman.
Jorun's World	Jorun's World is a planet of the Imperium. Jorun's World was invaded by Gorklaw's Waaagh! in 805.M41. The Ultramarines and the Imperial Guard desperately defended this planet from Orks.
Cyrene	Cyrene was a verdant world where the Blood Ravens chapter held their Blood Trials to choose new recruits for the Chapter. The world possessed a large proportion of mutants, particularly psykers but was also noted for an unswerving loyalty to the Emperor and capable soldiers who performed admirably in the Imperial Guard regiments tithed to the Imperium. Cyrene was a flourishing world that made use of an eclectic mixture of technologies, including the hydrofoil systems and extensive corrals for Sharaqs (see below). When Gabriel Angelos, who himself traced his origins to this planet, returned to it for recruiting and began the selection process, however, something soon changed his motivation. The Blood Trial process was stopped, after which Gabriel Angelos returned to the Strike Cruiser and immediately sent a secure Astropathic message to an unknown recipient.
Eydolim	Eydolim is an Imperial Shrine World and was most notable for being the sight of the Battle of Eagle Gate in late M41. The capital of the world is the walled city of Eydol. A vastly populated planet ruled by the Adeptus Ministorum, Eydolim is considered a place of incredible holiness, the site of the Miracles of Lumina, the birthplace of Saint Konaldine, and a loyal bastion of faith during the Horus Heresy. Eydolim is an ancient world with a long history dating back to the Dark Age of Technology, which most of its history during this time having since been lost. It is known, however, that during the Great Crusade, the world was claimed for the Emperor by the Word Bearers under Kor Megron. Under the Word Bearers' direction, Eydolim was a bastion of fanatical and dedicated worship of the Emperor as a living god. When the Emperor put an end to these practices, Lorgar would eventually begin to worship the Gods of Chaos. Kor Megron and his company stationed on Eydolim followed suit, and left the planet to fight the Emperor they once worshiped. The forces of Chaos would only return to the world ten thousand years later in the Battle of Eagle Gate.
Kommitzar	Kommitzar is a notorious Penal World in the Calixis Sector.
Forge Polix	Forge Polix is a Heretek-controlled Forge World of the Dark Mechanicum located in the Calixis Sector. Within Forge Polix toil many Magi of various specialities overseen by their master, Magos Onuris. They have waged a desperate and brutal war with the forces of the Exospectre and Forge Castir for untold ages. While the Exospectre currently holds the upper hand, the war shows no signs of ending in the near future. All who dwell in Forge Polix, from the lowliest servitor to the most learned Heretek, spend their every waking moment fighting to tip the balance of this conflict back to their favour. So desperate is Onuris that he frequently incites his minions to resort to drastic fields of study and experimentation. The Idolitrex Magi have fully embraced this call, devoting their efforts to the unremitting pursuit of innovation and experimentation. Idolitrex Magi are highly respected, if slightly disturbing, contributors to Polix’s progress, and all are utterly consumed by their quest. Many are pursue fields of study normally considered perilous or insane. Most retain loyalty to Onuris even once departing their ruined planet, but some formulate their own independent motivations which can become incompatible with their former master. Efficient and calculating, they will stop at nothing to obtain any scrap of data that may further their goals.
Kulth (Planet)	Kulth is a War World in the Calixis Sector. It has been fought over for 83 years since the first Ork invasion. It was the Capital World of The Periphery Subsector before it was invaded by Waaagh! Grimtoof. Kulth is the strategic lynchpin of the Spinward Front, for it bestrides the Calixis-Scarus Warp conduit and is the last Imperial planet within the borders of the sub-sector before the route plunges into the lawless voids of inter-sector Wilderness Space. It was Duke Severus I’s dream that the world would be a haven for the nobles of the Sector, founding the Sanguine Palace. That dream died when Drusus was elevated to the rank of first Lord Sector, and Kulth was declared the capital of the Periphery. Despite the terms of his Warrant of Trade, the world was prised from Severus by Drusus’s servants. A massive Administratum mission descended upon the verdant grasslands and set in motion the process by which Kulth was turned into the administrative centre of the new sub-sector.
Merov	Merov is a planet in the Calixis Sector and is home to the Merovech Combine.

Cult of the Rusted Claw	The Cult of the Rusted Claw is one of the six Genestealer Cults documented by the Ordo Xenos. The worldwide minecorps that toil beneath Newseam unearth hundreds of tons of precious metal from the planet’s crust each day. The sickeningly rich upworlders forbid the downtrodden miners from keeping the metal they dig out from the seams, let alone spending it, but much is smuggled away nonetheless. Known as the Cult of the Rusted Claw, this embittered brotherhood believes that the all-consuming emptiness of the void devours all, even metal. They see the tarnish of every coin and the rust that eats away at every vehicle as divine entropy brought to their world by their Patriarch, and they welcome its spread. Only when the oppression of the upworlders is gnawed away completely will they be truly free. Their symbol shows the cog of industry being consumed by the wyrm-form that represents the Patriarch’s great hunger. Because of their beliefs the Cult of the Rusted Claw is constantly on the move and maintains a harsh and neglected appearance for they see embellishing or polishing their equipment as a fruitless indulgence. Their weapons and vehicles are often in a state of disrepair and erosion. Some elements of the Cult can even create rust upon any metal they touch, which is believed to be derived from a Tyranid nano-symbiote. This invisible predator can consume even adamantium within minutes, something the Cult sees as a divine miracle.[2a]

Dorvastor	Dorvastor is a Cardinal World of the Imperium.
Xit	Xit is an Ork World, situated in the Imperium's Ultima Segmentum. It is notable for being the last world contested by the Space Wolves, during their 519th Crusade in 987.M41. A Human colony world long cut off from the Imperium due to the fierce warp storms which surround the subsector, Xit was home to a simple feudal society until the untoward arrival of an Ork space fleet that translated into the system by improbable accident. Unable to leave, the Orks made war upon the worlds of the Wheel of Fire. For over fifty years they ruled Xit, enslaving many of the population and forcing the others to hide in the forests, until the arrival of an Imperial Crusade chiefly made up of a large force of Space Wolves. Xit was the last world attacked by these Space Marines during their 5-year mission to pacify the system. It is not currently known whether or not Xit was completely cleansed of Ork infestation. Xit is both rocky and forested, as well as possessed of bodies of water. Mineral rich, it's soil is not particularly fertile, and so the Orks used it as a trade-hub. The central Ork concentration on the world was on the small continent codified as 'the Rock' by the Space Wolves. This island-continent sported the following landmarks:
KW-9	KW-9 is a Gas Giant located in a star system rimward of Melqart. The gas giant is even larger than Jupiter and is described as a massive, bloated gas giant surrounded by great azure rings and the shattered remains of its many moons.

Unfortunately, the planet is ill-suited for life because of its caustic atmosphere. Despite the fact that there are many enclosed hub-structures built, Vir Modren insists that his tech-adepts and bio-seers continue to terraform the planet.
Ghalmek	Ghalmek is a Daemon World located in the Maelstrom. It is under the control of the Word Bearers and serves as their primary base in that area to launch Black Crusades against the Imperium. It is described as being a factory-world.
Frumenta	Frumenta is an Imperial Agri World, that was once infested by Orks until the Astra Militarum arrived and cleansed the Xenos. However in the decades since becoming an Agri World, Frumenta would occasionally suffer attacks from Feral Orks, due to the Xenos' fungal spores. The world's militia was enough to deal with the attacks, until in late M41 when a Genestealer Cult uprising began on Frumenta. The militia played a key part in this, as it was infested with the Cult's members and Frumenta would be forced to send out a plea for aid. It was received by the Imperium and Lord General Zyvan led an Astra Militarum task force to aid the world. Upon their arrival, the task force overwhelmed the Genestealer Cult and its surviving members retreated to the mountainous Cascades region. In peaceful times, it was a popular tourist destination, which was home to a sparse population and rugged terrain the Cult's members hoped to hide in. The Militarum task force pursued the Cult into the Cascades, though, and is now hunting down its members, while also combating the Feral Orks that infest the region. Among those taking part in battle is the retired Commissar Ciaphas Cain, who is serving in Lord General Zyvan's general staff.
Virger-Mos II	Virger-Mos II is a Agri-World in an isolated area of the Dominion of Storms in the Ultima Segmentum. During the Horus Heresy it was the scene of massive civil strife due to a psyops disinformation campaign by the Alpha Legion.
Phagos VII	Phagos VII is a Daemon World in the Eye of Terror devoted to Nurgle. The world was once little more than an arid wasteland, until the children of Nurgle arrived. The indigenous creatures were quickly overcome, and shrine after shrine was erected in honour of the God of Plagues. In less than a year, Phagos VII teemed with life and every inch of its surface was covered in tiny, squirming creatures. Continent-spanning bogs of rancid water seethed and boiled with rapidly-multiplying organisms, the cycle of life and death playing out a million times a second. Nurgle saw this and was pleased.
Behtle V	Behtle V is a world of the Imperium. The well-known Shaonil theatre troupe resides on this planet.
Taranagea	Taranagea is an Imperium world that was brought into Compliance during the Great Crusade.

Travonth VI	Travonth VI is an Imperium world that suffered an attack by the Night Lords which wiped out the population of its Nux Haven colony.
Lind	Lind is a Hive World in the Malfian Sub-sector of the Calixis Sector. One of the largest ammunitions producers, supplying nearly a quarter of all frag grenades used across the Calixis Sector and beyond. They also produce untold tons of autogun and autopistol rounds each day, along with countless mortar and tank shells, heavy rounds for autocannons, and more all carrying their curled snake-symbol. While technically not a Forge World, their main facilities on Lind dominate the planet. Their highly rated PDF forces have also been hired out to many an expeditionary force, with the Armoury gaining a stake in any worlds conquered.
Orphia	Orphia is an Imperium Hive World. It was secretly infiltrated by one of Abaddon's powerful Lieutenants during the 13th Black Crusade. However, the Dark Angels were later drawn to Orphia as they tracked down clues for the Fallen and captured the Lieutenant during their search of the Hive World. The loss of this Lieutenant was a severe blow to the forces of Chaos and caused their attacks to falter, which allowed the Imperium time to increase their control of the beleaguered Caliban Sector.
Xenrick	Xenrick is the site of a battle between the Imperium and Craftworld Biel-Tan. The divining Silver Skulls Chapter became one of the few Imperial forces who could respond in anyway to the Eldar's unpredictable raids.
Krieg	Krieg is the homeworld of the Death Korps of Krieg regiments of the Imperial Guard, notorious throughout the galaxy as grim and fatalistic warriors. The planet is directly controlled by the Departmento Munitorum, who gear it entirely towards war. Krieg's earliest history is unknown and shrouded in mystery and rumor. Much of its historical records have been lost to time or deliberately purged. What is known is that Krieg was previously a prosperous Hive World of billions located in Segmentum Tempestus, specialising in manufacture and trade and led by a council of Autocrats. However, as time passed, the debauched and decadent Autocrats began to become paranoid that an outside threat would take their power away from them, and thus began to increasingly fortify the world from outside threats. Eventually, the Autocrats also began to resent the influence of the Administratum on a planet that they considered to be their own. Finally, in 433.M40, the High Autocrat declared himself independent from the Imperium and renounced the Emperor as his divine master. Civil war broke out on Krieg and much of the planet quickly fell to the rebels except for Hive Ferrograd, which was under the command of the now-infamous Colonel Jurten of the Krieg 83rd Imperial Guard regiment. Under strict orders to not let Krieg fall, but in the knowledge that no fleet on the scale needed to relieve them was available, Jurten decided that Krieg would either belong to the Emperor or to no one. On the day of the Feast of the Emperor's Ascension, Jurten unleashed a counter-attack of atomic cleansing in what became known as "the Purging." For days Krieg was engulfed in a sea of nuclear fire, resulting in a total collapse of its ecosystem and subsequent nuclear winter, but the civil war dragged on. The survivors from the Purging would fight on but were forced to exist in underground bunkers or deep in the radioactive chem-wastes, as their descendants do to this day. From the self-annihilation of their homeworld, loyalist troops slowly retook their world inch by inch over the course of 500 years until finally returning to Imperial rule in 949.M40. It would be from this cataclysmic event that the Death Korps of Krieg were born.
Quatra	Quatra is an Imperial Desert World, whose lands are barren and perilous. The rocky outcrops that surround the plains there, have edges as sharp as steel blades and they can easily cut through even the toughest armor.
Cassell	Cassell is an Imperial Agri World. Like many Agri Worlds, most of its population live in scattered farming communities. It has only one major city, the unimaginatively named Port Cassell.

Aurelia	Aurelia was the capital of Subsector Aurelia, until a mighty warp storm covered the planet and it was lost for centuries. Originally the homeworld of the Blood Ravens, the site was the home of their Fortress-Monastery known as Selenon. However, in M40 Warp Storms brought about by the Great Unclean One Ulkair consumed the planet. Thanks to the machinations of the Black Legion[Needs Citation], it recently returned to realspace and was the site of a conflict between the Black Legion and the Blood Ravens. What is left of Aurelia remains in realspace to this day and is heavily monitored by both the Blood Ravens and the Inquisition and is garrisoned by regiments of the Imperial Guard. During the formation of the Great Rift the planet again became the site of fighting between the forces of the Blood Ravens and Chaos.
Genovinga	Genovinga was the site of a battle for the Death Guard.
Verdant	Verdant is a world of the Imperium. It is known as being home to the Troth strain of Abhumans.
Chogoris	Chogoris, known in Imperial records as Mundus Planus, is the birthworld of the Primarch Jaghatai Khan and homeworld of the White Scars Space Marine Chapter. By the end of the Age of Strife Chogoris' Human population had regressed to a level of blackpowder-level of technology. During this time, it was ruled by a powerful empire under the Palatine who ruled from Quan Zhou. After his arrival, Jaghatai Khan united the tribes of the planet's western desert into a single horde and overthrew the Palatine. When the Khan left with the Emperor, he put Ogedei in control of the world, but Ogedei was not strong enough to hold the tribes together. The tribes fragmented and returned to their old ways of constant inter-tribal warfare. This may have been the Khan's purpose, because it allowed the Chapter's potential recruits to maintain their warrior culture. There would be many attempts to unite the tribes of the deserts but none would be as successful as the Khan's.
Wichard	Wichard was the site of a battle for the 50th Gudrunite Rifles Regiment.
Ceoris Ultra	Ceoris Ultra is a world in the Loki Sector, whose population was one of the first to embrace the Imperial Cult during the 32nd millennium. The system lords spent enormous sums in converting the capital city of Ceoris Ultra into a giant cathedral, which became the jewel of the Ecclesiarchy in the sector for more than four thousand years. The cathedral city was later destroyed by forces loyal to Goge Vandire during the Age of Apostasy.
Avitohol	Avitohol is a Xenos World in the Calixis Sector. Originally the site of battles between Orks and the Imperium, the world has since fallen under the heel of the Warboss Ghenghiz Grimtoof, who has enslaved the Human population as part of his overall Waaagh! Grimtoof in the Spinward Front.
Geyluss Auspix	Geyluss Auspix is a world of the Imperium, located in a region known as Pleigo Sutarnus. The planet itself was not considered particularly significant by Imperial authorities. However, this changed when a team of Imperial scouts discovered an intact Standard Template Constructor in a ruined city deep in the planet's jungles. This Constructor was capable of manufacturing extremely light, strong combat blades, which eventually became part of the standard armouries of over thirty Chapters of the Adeptus Astartes. The scouts were lauded as heroes - according to some, they were rewarded with ownership of an entire planet each.
Cretacia	Cretacia is the homeworld of the Flesh Tearers Space Marine Chapter. For several millennia after the Horus Heresy, the Flesh Tearers were a fleet-based chapter, engaged on a never-ending crusade to crush mankind's enemies and reclaim the territories lost by the Imperium to Chaos. However, they were suffering heavy casualties, both from combat and the high occurrence of the Black Rage in their ranks.[Conflicting sources] The oversized world that came to be known as Cretacia was the fourth planet in a system of seven, and at first approach, it appeared to be uninhabitable. Finding the planet was perpetually shrouded in dense clouds, the Flesh Tearers effected landings on the planet to discover what lay below. What the Space Marines discovered was a planet to rival any Death World known in its lethality to human life.[3b]
Gareva	Gareva once held an isolated Imperium colony, until it was destroyed by the Word Bearers and World Eaters Legions as they traveled to invade Ultramar during the Horus Heresy.
Bilani	Bilani is an Agri World in the Calixis Sector.
Luther Macintyre IX	Luther Macintyre IX (also known as Luther McIntyre IX[2a]) is a desert death world in Segmentum Tempestus, notable for being the homeworld of the burrowing, desert-dwelling Ambull species.[1a][2a] Luther Macintyre IX is an Imperial Death World: the entire planet covered in vast deserts. The sandstorms that plague this world are capable of flaying a man's skin from his bones. Luther Macintyre IX is also thought to be a possible Tomb World, as an Ambull colony was found on the Ice world Simia Orichalcae, having come through a Necron warp portal to that planet when the Necron portal was inadvertently activated by an Ork vessel exiting the warp over it. However, dozens of other planets have Ambull colonies, so it is equally likely that another planet with Ambulls was the origin of the creatures found on Simia Orichalcae.[1a][1b]
Yngroth	Yngroth was the site of a battle between the Harlequins of the Masque of the Silent Shroud and the Wrath Warband in 994.M41. While pursuing the Harlequins, the Wrath was caught in a devastating ambush by a warhost from Craftworld Yme-Loc. It appeared the Warband would soon be destroyed, when suddenly Arbra'Gax, Bloodthirster of Insensate Rage, burst into reality. Led by this unstoppable Greater Daemon of Khorne, the Wrath smashed their way out of the Eldar ambush, which swiftly devolved into a massacre, as the Blood God's forces punished their devious foes.

Vanqualis	Vanqualis is a planet that lies in the Obsidian System somewhere in the Scaephan Sector.[1a] The planet is home to the Falken family, which rules it in a near-feudal state.[1a] Its only contact with the Imperium is when it pays its yearly tithes.[1a] It holds two continents, Herograve, which is covered in hive cities, and Nevermourn, the jewel of the Obsidian system.[1a] In M41, one of Vanqualis' largest cities, and the capital city, Palatium, was overrun by an Ork horde.[1a] The 901st Penal Legion,[1c] along with the Soul Drinkers[1b] and the Howling Griffons[1d] Space Marine Chapters responded to the planet's plea for help.[1a]
Chiros Sector	The Chiros Sector is a Sector of the Imperium located in Segmentum Tempestus.[3a] Many of the worlds of the sector contributed resources to the Macharian Crusade.[3b]

Vulcron	Vulcron is an Imperial Mining World, that has been mined so extensively that it has damaged the world and has caused its surface crack apart. Now magma spews forth from the cracks and lava channels cover Vulcron's surface. This made it a dangerous battlefield for the Ultramarines Chapter, as they arrived to defend the world from an invasion by Chaos Space Marines.
Foth III	Foth III is a world of the Imperium. Foth III is the capital planet of the Foth system, considered little more than a blemish on the unremarkable quadrant's starcharts.
Swamp World	Swamp Worlds are planets which consist majorily or completely by bogs and swamps. Vast massives of nigh-impenetrable swamp territories is the main, distinctive feature of these worlds. Also Swamp Worlds often inhabited by many dangerous creatures. Due to complicated imperial classification, Swamp Worlds can be classified as a separate world's type or as a subtype of the Death Worlds.
Armato	Armato is the homeworld of the Sons of Orar Space Marine Chapter. It is a hive world, with at least some parts of it known for tunnel warfare carried out by juvenile killers.
Klaat	Klaat is a Imperium Hive World which sometimes serves as a Naval refueling station. [1b]
Ignatius Cardinal	Ignatius Cardinal (also known simply as Ignatius) is a world of the Imperium. The planet hosts a Schola Progenium facility, known as the Schola Progenium Prime of Ignatius. The Schola was located within visible distance of Ignatius (the world's capital city) and the main Ecclesiarchy Temple on the planet, whose towers stretched over two kilometres into the air. The world was noted to be cold, wet and dark. Notable alumni include Colonel-Commissar Ibram Gaunt and Commissar Vaynom Blenner.
Caldrin	Caldrin was the site of a battle between Tallarn Regiments of the Imperial Army and the forces of Horus during the Heresy.
Pascaari	Pascaari is a world that lies near the Eye of Terror and was the last reported location of the Imperial Navy's Battlefleet Kruvek, which sent out a desperate plea for aid before it was suddenly destroyed by a Warp anomaly. Why the Battlefleet was anchored above Pascaari is unknown, but rumours that vessels belonging to the Inquisition were among the fleet caused the Imperium to quickly dispatch a strike force there in order to search for any secrets the wreckage that crashed into the world may have contained. When the strike force reached Pascaari, however, they learned that the forces of Chaos and various Xenos species had already landed upon it, intent on the same goal as they were, and a war between the various factions enveloped the world.
Forgotten Fleets	Forgotten Fleets was a concept inspired by an excerpt from Codex: Tyranids. Six Games Workshop hobbyists created their own Tyranid creatures using existing Games Workshop models and then wrote background details to go with them. The excerpt reads: "Many of the Magos Biologis who claim to be experts in the true nature of the Tyranid threat believe that the Tyranids of Behemoth were not the first to enter our galaxy. They were merely the first to arrive in large numbers. Archaeological evidence indicates there were potential Tyranid contacts long before the 41st millennium. "We can only speculate whether these contacts were from proto-hive fleets, a long-range scouting force, or even creatures fleeing ahead of the oncoming Tyranid fleets."
Gorzal	Gorzal is a drenched world covered in swamps and is home to the Tyranid variant known as the Gorzal Swamp Lurker.
Lambs World	Lambs World is an Imperium world, whose Planetary Governor is known by the title of Lord.
Zahndrekh	Zahndrekh is a Necron Nemesor and ruler of the Sautekh Tomb World of Gidrim. He is known as a military genius along the Eastern Fringe. Zahndrekh was born into elite echelon of nobility. He had attended one of the Necrontyr's most celebrated military academies, where he met his close confidant and rival Setekh. It was there that he spent what he considers the best days of his life. After winning his commission, he was given an army and sent off to fight separatists in Yama during the Wars of Secession. Varguard Obyron, already a veteran, was assigned to him during this time. As a reward for his triumph in Yama, he was given the world of Gidrim.[4b] The Great Sleep damaged Zahndrekh's mind. Despite evidence that proves otherwise, he believes that he is still a Necrontyr of flesh and bone working to crush the rebellions of the Wars of Secession millions of years ago. He does not see his enemies as Orks, Eldar, or Humans, but rather as rebellious fellow Necrontyr attempting to usurp the power of the Triarch.
Port Sanctus	Port Sanctus is an Imperial shipyard and Imperial Navy base in Segmentum Solar. A key strategic world in the Segmentum, during the War of the Beast it fell under a vicious Ork siege led by one of the infamous Attack Moons. Half of Segmentum Solar's naval strength was ultimately committed to freeing Port Sanctus and succeeded in breaking the siege and destroying the Attack Moon, though at great cost.
Newseam	Newseam is a Mining World of the Imperium. Unknown to the ruling class, deep in the subterranean mining slums of the planet the Genestealer Cult of the Rusted Claw schemes.
Dh'artan	Dh'artan was a Tau Sept World which was doomed after its Earth Caste farmers' hydro-tech became broken. They soon became so desperate for rain that they ignored protocol and gave in to the superstitions of the primitive tribes that they had usurped Dh'artan from. However, it was the Great Unclean One Rotigus who heard their pleas, and he caused a neverending downpour of rain to fall upon Dh'artan. Now the entire world is nothing but a giant foetid swamp that is rife with plague.
Cardrim	Cardrim is an Imperial world located close to the vital Forge World of Ryza. Barren and of little importance, it became strategically valuable when Ryza was assaulted by Waaagh! Grax. In the resulting Battle of Cardrim, it was revealed that it was also a Tomb World home to a legion of Necrons under Overlord Tarekh of the Nihilakh Dynasty. In the end, however, the White Scars managed to cleanse the world of its Xenos and return it to Imperial hands.
Phobos	Phobos is known for raising the Phobos Imperial Guard Regiments.
Cinderus XI	Cinderus XI is a mining world of the Imperium. Several thousand heretic psykers were slaughtered and buried beneath the lava rivers on the planet, after a failed plot to kill the Planetary Governor. Their remains were compressed by the shifting geological structures and when they combined with the natural elements present beneath the lava they formed a unique crystalline mineral. The Magos Geologis would later discover the crystals taken from this mineral vein had peculiar properties that made them useful in the construction of Volcano Cannons.
Dhorthan	Dhorthan was once the Prime Hive World of the Dhorthian System of the Imperium, until it fell to a Chaos invasion during the 13th Black Crusade.

Go'shol	Go'shol is an Ice World and a current war zone for the Tau Empire.
M'Laar XIII	M'Laar XIII was a former world of the Imperium, now changed into a Daemon World by the forces of Chaos. M'Laar XIII was previously under the control of the Imperium, when it was captured by the forces of Chaos in the Blackstar Crusade of the Khornate Lord Ekrak in M34. The planet was changed into a Daemon World and as a reward for his victory, Ekrak was elevated to a Daemon Prince and given control of the newly reborn world. However, his subordinates vied for control of the planet and soon broke their allegiances to Ekrak and each other. Millennia later, the planet is still wracked by conflict as Ekrak battles his former army for control of the planet.
Relic World	A Relic World is a classification of Imperium world where, like Cardinal and Sepulchre Worlds, the Ecclesiarchy's might can be found in strength. However because of this, these worlds are targeted by the Word Bearers, who seek to replace the Emperor's images contained there, with their own twisted statues and trophies.

Sanisor	Sanisor was an Imperium World, until it fell to a Black Legion attack in 356.M38. In M38, Sanisor fell prey to a devastating Chaos attack. The Black Legion ravaged the world, staining its dune oceans red with blood. In the Warpwind Canyons, the Chaos Space Marines erected a towering steel-framed device with a sail-like membrane of flayed skin. The creatures of the Warp were drawn to the world to feed on the souls caught in the nightmarish construction. When the Cadian 232nd Expeditionary Force landed on Sanisor, they found it crawling with Daemons like flies on a corpse.
Wolf King (Novella)	Wolf King is a limited-release novella written by Chris Wraight and part of the Horus Heresy series. It was published in October 2015. It was included as part of the "Nine Loyal Primarchs" set for 2016 12 Days of Christmas: Day 9. The Space Wolves were set upon by the forces of the Alpha Legion before they had even recovered from the Razing of Prospero – hounded to the edge of the Alaxxes Nebula, in desperation Leman Russ called out to his primarch brothers for aid. None came. Now, with their fleet stranded and supplies dwindling, the warriors of the Rout face almost certain death amidst the rust-red clouds of the nebula. But what a glorious end it shall be, worthy of the sagas of old, and Alpharius’s sons will soon learn that a cornered wolf is always the most deadly...
Titan Legions (game)	Titan Legions was the second boxed set realeased for the second edition of the Epic game system. It was designed to operate either as a stand-alone game, or in conjunction with Space Marine (Second Edition) in a similar style to the earlier Adeptus Titanicus and Space Marine (First Edition) games. Titan Legions was notable for introducing the Imperial Emperor-class Imperator Titan and the Ork Mega-Gargants, all of which were immensely powerful and could constitute small armies in their own right. These 'Mega' class vehicles could only be used in large games and none of the other races had such an equivalent. They were gradually phased out in later editions, though the current 4th edition has optional rules for them.
Jumael IV	Jumael IV is an Imperial Guard recruiting ground for the Jumael Volunteers.[1a] The planet is an agri world covered in small holdings.[1b] In one of the periods of its history the planet was attacked by the Orks with certain number of Gunwagons in their army.
Blood Cult	Blood Cults are types of Chaos Cults that worship Khorne, the Blood God. These Cultists gather in backrooms and secret slaughter tunnels beneath crowded streets, plotting murder and bloodshed in Khorne’s name. Given the terrible nature of many Imperial worlds, however, locals often barely notice increases in violent crimes, missing persons, and gory dismemberments, allowing Blood Cults of Khorne to flourish below the rot of society. The members of these cults have many different reasons for joining together. Some have seen a friend die in a bar fight. Others have lost their families in Adeptus Arbites raids. There are even those who fight for sport because they enjoy the feeling of fists shattering jawbones. All these reasons and more can set a man on the path toward Khorne. Vengeance and combat are intoxicating to those predisposed to revel in them. This feeling drives individuals to want more, to be strong enough to topple greater foes, and to seek the power necessary to do so. No matter the reason that brings them together, when these individuals find each other, they are united by a common desire. They wish to kill, offering blood and skulls in exchange for power and retribution, and Khorne has much to offer them in the bargain.
Eastern Fringe	The Eastern Fringe is the area of space located to the farthest galactic-east. It is largely unexplored by the Imperium of Man beyond a few dispersed and isolated human settlements, though the region is known as the home of alien civilizations, barbarous and advanced alike. Defenders of the neighboring Ultima Segmentum watch the borders for intrusions from Eastern Fringe threats like the Necron Sautekh Dynasty, Tau Empire, and Tyranid Hive Fleets.[5a] This article purports to rely on sources which are not cited in the body of the text.For help on citation see the citation guidelines.

Moebian Sixth	The Moebian 6th is a Traitor Guard regiment, formerly an infantry regiment of the Astra Militarum.[5c] After a long period of distinguished service in defending the Imperium's Moebian Domain from the forces of Chaos and other Xenos threats, the unit was corrupted by Nurgle and subsequently supported a Chaos cult uprising on their homeworld Atoma Prime. The Moebian Sixth was one of many Astra Militarum Regiments raised in the Moebian Domain, tasked with defending the sector's borders of the Moebian Domain, colloquially referred to as the fringe regions, from Chaos and Xenos threats, locally called the "Darktide". Recruited mostly from Atoma Prime, the Moebian Sixth distinguished itself in M41 on the front-lines of the many campaigns and battles attempting to hold off the encroaching Darktide from the Moebian Fringe. These Fringe Wars are often waged on Feral Worlds and Death Worlds across the Moebian Fringe where horrible enemies are fought with little external support. For years, the Moebian Sixth served the Imperium loyally and became the most famous and celebrated Moebian regiment. They Moebian 6th were fighting the toughest campaigns on the Fringe. Exclusively being deployed to defend their homeworld's Sector, contrary to standard Astra Militarum doctrines. The 6th developed a nostalgia for their homeworld that they would resupply on between campaigns.
Ka'hesku Atoll	Ka'hesku Atoll was once a Tau Sept World, until its Fire Caste were defeated by an Ultramarines strike force, led by Captain Cato Sicarius. This led the Tau to abandon the world, to the Imperium.

Vimox	Vimox was the site of a battle involving the Dark Angels Chapter, sometime after the Great Rift's creation.
Phaedra	You’ve come to a water world and found a grey-green hell like no other. The oceans of Phaedra are choked with islands and in turn the islands are overrun with a wildfire cancer of vegetation – a morass of stinking kelp, strangling vines and towering fungal cathedrals. Worse still, the islands themselves are alive. Just look beneath the waterline and you’ll see them breathing and pulsing. Phaedra (Fi’draah to the T’au) is an inhospitable ocean world noted for its exceptionally difficult biosphere, with only its lack of macropredators or cataclysmic geological events preventing it from being classified as a true death world.[1b] It is home to the Saathlaa, a sanctioned strain of mutants descended from humanity, and may itself be sentient.[1e][1b] One of two inhabited worlds of the eleven planets in the Yuxa System, itself part of the Damocles Gulf region of the Eastern Fringe,[1c] Phaedra is described as a “grey-green hell” and “too lazy to be a death world, too bitter to be anything else”.[1b] Its surface is over eighty-percent water, which takes on a yellow, blotchy, curdled appearance and smells of sewage thanks to glutinous algae blooms,[1d] divided into oceans and typhoon-wracked seas such as the Sargaatha.[1b][1f] Ancient coral growths form landmasses, some considered continents, the largest of which is Dolorosa.[1b] This archipelago comprises many islands, notably those designated by the Imperium as Topaz, Vermillion, Magenta, and Azure.[1b][1c][1e][1h] At least one is large enough to contain an inland sea, named Lake Amrythaa, meaning “Wellspring of Life” in the local tongue.[1j]
Forgewell	Forgewell was the site of a battle involving the Dark Angels Master Belial during his command of the Chapter's Third Company.
Mataras IV	Mataras IV is a Dead World in the Mataras System of the Jericho Reach. Mataras IV was originally a verdant paradise-like Agri World. Together with the other three planets in the Mataras System, collectively known as the Mataras Sisters, it served as a breadbasket for the Jericho Sector core planets. During the Age of Shadows, which began in M37, the entire system's human populations slowly descended into worship of Chaos, following promises that they would be protected from off-world slavers and xenos.
Malanthar VII	Malanthar VII was the site of a battle for the Tau Empire.
Yarant	Yarant III is an Imperial world, located in the Segmentum Solar. During the 2nd siege of the world in the Great Crusade, the early IXth Legion's 14th Company was deployed under Rogal Dorn. During the campaign they consumed prisoners of war in front of the enemy walls, inspiring terror and fear. They were formally censured after supposedly consuming wounded members of the allied Malagant Rifles as they retreated. During the Horus Heresy, Yarant III became the site of a battle between the Space Wolves and a coalition of traitor forces led by Abaddon. The Space Wolves were routed and Leman Russ badly injured, though in the end they were saved by the Raven Guard led by Corax.
Voltemand	Voltemand was reclaimed for the Imperium early on in the Sabbat Worlds Crusade. It is listed as being won back by the Royal Volpone regiments of the Imperial Guard, although other regiments, including the Tanith First and Only, were also instrumental in securing victory. Commanding a route into the heart of the sector, taking the world was of high importance to the Crusade. Little is known of the world's geography or planetary conditions, beyond some small mentions. The Tanith First and Only, under covering fire from the Ketzok 17th Armoured Regiment was to advance to the city walls and create two breaches. Once these breaches had been formed, the code word 'Thunderhead' would be given to the men of the Royal Volpone 50th, who would assault on mass.
Nocturne	Nocturne is the homeworld of the Salamanders Space Marine Chapter. It is a binary planetary system, with its over-sized moon Prometheus circling Nocturne erratically causing massive tectonic stress. There are vast chains of volcanoes and frequent earthquakes, destroying what little the people built. The enormous levels of stellar radiation present on the world has given most of its life a dark obsidian-like appearance, including its people. Settled by Humanity during the Dark Age of Technology, Nocturne's bleak and unforgiving nature bred a hardy and stoic people. During the time of the Great Crusade the Primarch Vulkan was deposited onto the world and upon growing to adulthood drove back the Dark Eldar raiders which had tormented the planet for centuries. When the Emperor arrived at Nocturne he found Vulkan as its king and protector. Thereafter Nocturne has served as the Homeworlds of the Salamanders.
Necron Dynasty	Necron Dynasties were former great houses of the Necrontyr. Now, however, they are entities of allegiance for every Necron. Allegiance to a dynasty was once purely a matter of family and tradition, but it is now entrenched through conquest and programming. Before the coming of the C'tan, there were many hundreds of Necrontyr dynasties. Through the Wars of Secession, the War in Heaven, and the rebellion against the C'tan, many of these dynasties were destroyed. It is impossible to say how many survived, though the number is likely in the hundreds. Since the Silent King destroyed the protocols of control over the Necron race, the Necron Dynasties now act independently from one another and pursue their own agendas. Each Dynasty is ruled over by a Necron Overlord while the most powerful Dynasties, ones which encompass an entire Sector, may be ruled over by Phaerons. Currently, the Sautekh Dynasty is the most powerful of the Necron race.
Ne'deble	Ne'deble is an Imperium world that was brought into compliance by Imperial forces led by the Emperor during the early years of the Great Crusade.
Penumbral Cult	The Penumbral Cult was a Chaos Cult that was destroyed on the Agri-world of Sharlor by the Black Templars. As the Cult's leader was publicly executed, it was revealed that he had been possessed by a Lord of Change, when it tore its way free from his severed head. The Lord of Change soon took to the sky and unleashed a maelstrom of psychic fire on the Black Templars, until it was killed by the Hunter Javelin of Faith.
Thical	Thical is a Hive World in the Calixis Sector. It is a world of ancient laws and restrictive customs.
Trantis IX	Trantis IX is a former world of the Imperium, now in the grips of the World Eaters.[1a] Though Trantis IX has been overrun by the World Eaters, a strike force from the Ultramarines Chapter has made planetfall, in the hopes of planting an Exterminatus device that would destroy the infested world.
Drop Site Massacre	The Drop Site Massacre is the most commonly used term for the Battle of Isstvan V, one of the first open military conflicts between the traitor forces of the Warmaster Horus and the loyalist forces of the Emperor. Occurring at the outset of the Horus Heresy it is considered a rubicon moment in Imperial history, as it marked the moment where the traitor legions were irrevocably committed to galactic civil war. The effects and aftermaths of the battle - particularly amongst the Legiones Astartes - would still be echoing ten thousand years later. Up until shortly before the battle of Isstvan V, Horus' rebellion was largely going according to plan. The first significant check to his scheme was met when Ferrus Manus, Primarch of the Iron Hands refused to join the rebellion, despite the entreaties of his close brother, Fulgrim. Manus' refusal forced Fulgrim and his small contingent of Emperor's Children marines to violently escape the rendezvous, a surprise action that inflicted considerable damage upon the Iron Hands' space fleet. Horus, accepting that Fulgrim could sway Ferrus Manus, had factored in the Gorgon's appearance on his side as part of his plans. This news - late in arriving as Fulgrim suffered delays caused by the warp while traveling from the meeting place to the Istvaan system - irritated the Warmaster as it meant Horus' forces would suffer additional and unplanned-for casualties, as well as those inflicted by the then-ongoing and also unexpectedly protracted Battle of Isstvan III. Horus subsequently ordered Fulgrim and his portion of Emperor's Children not assigned to Isstvan III to proceed to Isstvan V and create a fortified position there.[1a] Fulgrim chose a ruined pre-Imperial fortress and defensive wall emplacement on the lip of the Urgall Plateau as the basis for his fortification. With the aid of Dark Mechanicum elements attached to Horus' forces he swiftly created a vast network of trenches, bulwarks and redoubts around this wall and fortress, emplacing anti-aircraft batteries and surface-to-orbit missile silos all along and behind the perimeter.[1b] The fortress itself he partially rebuilt, reinforcing it and even installing a protective void shield[2a] system. This would serve as Horus' command post in the battle to come.[1b]
Fi'rios	Fi'rios a T'au sept world and a Third Phase Colony. The Tau occupying this world wrested it from the grip of a fierce Ork warlord, though doing so cost them dearly. The sept world has become a veritable fortress, though local battles still rage on its outlying worlds. T'au of this sept are known for a tenacious refusal to accept defeat, tempered by a stoic acceptance of the price all must pay in the furtherance of the Greater Good. The victory on Fi'rios was attributed to Shas'O'Kais (one of Commander Puretide's disciples), who was brought out of stasis an unknown time prior to the conflict.[2a]
ND0/K4	ND0/K4 is a gas giant whose atmosphere is rich in hydrogen, helium, and ethane, chemicals all used in various manufacturing and industrial processes. The large refinery platforms, which are balanced in a delicate, very low orbit, are dangerous, claustrophobic mazes of access tunnels, processing centres, and power plants. Each is a crumbling relic, ripe for sabotage which could cripple industry across the sector. The economic and social imbalance between the ruling Techpriests and the workers, coupled with a small population and relative isolation, has the potential to spark into rebellion against the oppressive Cult of the Machine God. Tension between the Ministorum and the Cult lead to further instability. Finally, the largest moon of ND0/K4 remains a tantalizing enigma, rumors circulating of haunted tunnels and ancient relics buried under its surface. Few outside the Mechanicus know what the Tech Priests found in those tunnels, for they guard the information with the utmost secrecy, or what happened to the ones that never returned.
Praxis II	Praxis II is a current battleground between the Imperial Guard and the Tyranids of Hive Fleet Leviathan.
Gath Rimmon	Gath Rimmon is a planetoid classified as a Death World by the Imperium. It is the third world of the Iopheas Secundus System. A rocky planet, Gath Rimmon is nearly covered by impenetrable acid oceans that are driven by constant storms. The planetoid seems to be semi-aware and is able to create creatures from its rocky surface to kill anyone who lands on the planet. All of this means that no permanent human settlements have ever been established on Gath Rimmon; in fact, merely surveying the planetoid is almost impossible. Gath Rimmon possesses one natural satellite, called Riapax. The moon's orbit is highly irregular, with a period of 5467 years. Once every orbital period, the gravitational influence of Riapax results in the acid oceans on Gath Rimmon receding enough to allow exploration for three days.
Imperium Maledictum	Warhammer 40,000 Roleplay: Imperium Maledictum is the spiritual successor to the beloved series of roleplaying games started by Black Industries over ten years ago. Imperium Maledictum is a d100 based system for roleplaying in the grim darkness of the 41st millennium, and will incorporate all of the best parts of previous Warhammer 40,000 d100 roleplaying games, as well as Cubicle 7’s own award-winning Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 4th Edition. Players take on the roles of citizens of the Imperium in service to a powerful patron, with games focused on investigation and social encounters rather than combat. The Imperium is a deadly place, and the players must tread carefully if they hope to survive. Your service to your patron allows you to move through Imperial society where others can’t. The Influence you and your patron have with the many factions of the Imperium will determine how your investigations proceed, where you can go, and what resources you have access to. Imperium Maledictum takes place in the Macharian Sector, named for Lord Solar Macharius, and will allow players and GMs to explore the sector as never before. The Imperium Maledictum core rulebook gives players and GMs everything they need to begin playing, including a guide to the Macharian Sector, patrons to serve, and enemies to face. Future books will focus on specific factions, allowing players to take on the roles of agents in service to a powerful Inquisitor, or perhaps as dedicated servants of the ecclesiarchy.
Ramillon IV	Ramillon IV was the site where the Dark Angels Chapter's Task Force Rhyarn was nearly defeated in battle, until the Legion of the Damned suddenly appeared and came to their aid.

Aquilon	Aquilon was the Homeworld of the Executioners Space Marine Chapter. In the aftermath of the Badab War, the defeated Executioners were forced to forfeit the world to the Sons of Medusa and undertake a 100-year long penitent Crusade.
Ambull	Ambulls are subterranean xenos creatures native to the desert death world of Luther McIntyre IX, in the Segmentum Solar, but which have since been spread to multiple worlds. Ambulls are four-limbed insectoid creatures with thick carapaces. They have huge barrel-chested bodies and an ape-like stance, their arms reaching almost to the ground, while their legs are crooked and short. The Ambull's most characteristic feature are their huge expandable jaws. Their eyes are able to sense heat. Being able to see deep into the infrared spectrum, making their vision impeccable even in the faintest levels of light, even being able to detect heat signatures as a visual stimulus. Their hunched stance disguises their true size, but an upright Ambull with its arms stretched overhead would reach four meters in height. An Ambull's limbs end in iron-hard claws used for digging through the soft stone of their homeworld. Ambulls will excavate tunnels in which to live, spending most of their time underground. These burrows can often form extensive underground complexes. Powerful limbs tipped with diamond-hard enable them to dig at a surprising speed. Their tunnelling abilities have also defied attempts on many Imperial worlds to domesticate or corral them.[2a]
Catrangras	Catrangras is a Desert World that the T'au Empire is preparing to invade.
Hermetica	Hermetica is a Hive World of the Imperium. It serves as the capital of the Chonma Sector. In 659.M41, the world was assaulted by millions of Mutants and Word Bearers under the Dark Apostle Leyak the Devourer. However, thanks to the Minotaurs and Imperial Guard forces from nearby Necromunda, the heretic forces were defeated but only at the cost of great devastation to the planet. In addition to the damage from Chaos forces, the Minotaurs also showed little restraint and devastated much of the planet and its civilian population to destroy the heretics, particularly through orbital bombardment. The Space Hulk Nightmare of Paradox, which the traitors originally arrived to Hermetica in, still orbits the planet in a quarantined zone awaiting examination by the Grey Knights for suspected daemonic infestation. Notable locations on the planet include a Basilica devoted to Saint Lehsor.
Clax	Clax is a planet in the Ultima Segmentum. Near the end of Vandire's Reign of Blood, news arose of a planet that had declared him traitor. Their leader was Sebastian Thor, who founded the Confederation of Light, which was soon made up of over 80 planets, all denouncing Vandire's rule. Vandire sent a great fleet to Thor's homeworld, Dimmamar which departed from Clax. Soon after the great fleet jumped into the warp, a great warp storm arose, wiping the fleet out in what was later believed to have been the work of the Emperor himself, and was later known as the Storm of the Emperor's Wrath. Ever since, Clax has been lost in the warp.
Tornish	Tornish is an Imperial world known for its clan-slums. It was also the homeworld of Inquisitor Eisenhorn's agent, Lores Vibben.
Ke'lshan	Ke'lshan, alternatively spelt as Kel'shan , is a Tau sept located near the Perdus Rift. It was founded as part of the second phase colonies. Its inhabitants have a reputation of being solemn, withdrawn, unfriendly, and at times even openly hostile to aliens. This mistrust is due to frequent invasions by all manner of alien races.[2a] Ke'lshan's uniform colouring is suitable for shipboard duty, such as the Cadres stationed aboard Air Caste vessels interdicting the Perdus Rift.[2b]
Hambro Cuth (Feudal World)	Hambro Cuth is an Imperial Feudal World that is forbidden from having access to advanced technology, due to its entire population being latent psykers. However, when an ancient doomsday device on the world became activated, a group of Imperial agents had to be sent to Hambro Cuth in order to deactivate it. Unfortunately the device was located underneath an occupied castle and as Hambro Cuth's population must be protected from advanced technology at all costs, the agents could not simply ask the castle's occupants for their cooperation. Instead, a group of Space Marines have been sent to cleanse the occupied castle, and then defuse the doomsday device. Once their mission is complete, the Space Marines have been ordered to kill any witnesses that saw them and remove any signs of their presence before they leave Hambro Cuth.
Herod	Herod is an Mining World of the Imperium. The crystals yielded from Herod's desert mountain mesas, are used in the manufacture of las-weapons across the Achilles subsector. During the 13th Black Crusade, a rebellion started by the Shinarii chaos cult nearly overwhelmed the planet and many figures in the government wereexecuted by crucifixion. A small task force of the Iron Hands chapter assaulted the Shinarii's citadel stronghold in the planet's capital Antipas. Within moments, the cultists' grip on the citadel was broken and with it the heart of the cult's strength. The remaining pockets of resistance were rooted out and put down quickly and effectively by the Iron Hands and the planet's PDF. In the space of thirty-six hours standard, Imperial forces had been able to take back control of Herod.[1a] With the planet back under control of the Imperium, the Irons hands could continue with their main mission on the planet: finding the Araken artefact called the Bei'bul Stone. Traveling to a cave, amid the vast deserts of Herod, the Iron Hands found a large cultist shrine. In the middle of the shrine stood the Bei'bul Stone. There the remaining Shinarii cult's forces where involved in some ritual, around the stone. Also guarding the stone were a squad of Word Bearers Chaos Space Marines, led by the Dark Apostle, the Iscariot, the true power behind the cult.[1b]

Trakonn	Trakonn is a Necron Tomb World and Crownworld of the Dyvanakh Dynasty. The Necrons of Trakonn originally awoke in early M41 but were not able to shake off their hibernation-induced disorientation for some five centuries. This proved enough time for their Tomb World to draw the attention of a nearby Imperial Forge World, which resulted in a series of wars against the Imperium. Finally breaking the Imperial siege, the Trakonn armies cast the upstart humans from their planet and have begun to search for the other Tomb Worlds of their dynasty.
Voth	Voth was the site where Waaagh! Smogbelcha was destroyed by the Knights of House Raven.

See: Adeptus Astartes Homeworld. See: Daemon Worlds.
Signus Cluster	The Signus Cluster is a trinary star system of the Galaxy. It is located in the Northern Cross, on the Eastern Fringe.[1a] At the onset of the Horus Heresy, Horus sent a messenger aboard the Word Bearers vessel Dark Page to a mustering of the Blood Angels Legion, informing Sanguinius that the worlds of the Signus Cluster had gone dark due to the reemergence of a xenos race called the Nephilim, thought to have been destroyed by the Blood Angels, Luna Wolves and White Scars legions during the Great Crusade.[1a] Horus called for the Blood Angels to respond in force, and Sanguinius agreed, mustering the bulk of the legion along with the Word Bearers on the Dark Page and a surprise contingent of Space Wolves[1b] that had joined the fleet on the command of Malcador the Sigillite.[1c] In reality, however, the message was a trap. Secretly the Signus Cluster was the focus of a Daemonic snare designed to corrupt the Blood Angels and cause them to fall to Chaos.
Mordian Iron Guard	"They may spend every off-duty minute polishing their shiny boots and marching up and down the parade ground in perfect formation, but don't let that fool you. These men are steel-eyed, cold-blooded killers and I'd as soon have a platoon of them in my force as I would a company of other troops."- Gharan O'Hen, Army 212 Chief of Staff, on the Mordian Iron Guard[3a] The Mordian Iron Guard are Regiments of the Imperial Guard hailing from the planet Mordian. They are famed across the Imperium for their discipline, infantry quality, and brightly colored uniforms.[3a] The Mordian Iron Guard are Imperial Guard regiments, originally from the planet Mordian. A harsh and unforgiving planet given to extremes, it was ruled in the Emperor's name by a body known as the Tetrarchs. The rule of the Tetrarchs was harsh, autocratic and above all absolute, a necessity due to planet's scarce and strictly-rationed resources. This environment bred a regimental system dedicated to the chain of command and an iron discipline at all levels. The Mordian Iron Guard are named and renowned for their iron resolve and their dour and unforgiving natures.
Biegel 9	Biegel 9 is a hot, jungle-covered planet.

Myosan	Myosan is an Agri World of the Imperium. In 981.M41, Myosan was attacked by the Necrons. The world was saved by the Tempestus Scions of the 14th Alphic Dragons regiment.
Urk	Urk was an Ork World and the planet of origin of Ghazghkull Mag Uruk Thraka. This planet was founded by an exploration fleet from Terra during the Dark Age of Technology. It was named Urokleas and was an excellent hub for the human race due to strong tides of the Warp flowing through the system. Urokleas prospered, for it was rich in minerals, ores and metals and within a few hundred years humans flourished, building great cities and spaceports. Then the planet was attacked by Orks, who razed all in their way, leaving behind them only their spores. These spores were the beginning of the future history of the planet. Due to the flow of the Warp, space-faring races again inhabited the Zornian System. Urokleas was an Eldar outpost, the home of a cluster of Spinedorians, and a Hrud warren. At times, the dormant Ork spores erupted, and greenskins developed in some secretive corner of the planet.
Vhospis	Vhospis is a Feudal World of the Imperium. In 984.M41, a Warp Rift opened above the planet, resulting in a swarm of Daemonic creatures spilling onto its surface. In the ensuing battle, the Silver Sabres Space Marines arrived and help turn the tide. Vhospis is located less than a light-year away from the planet Mercuria.

Luxor Uprising	The Luxor Uprising was an Alpha Legion-sponsored rebellion that took place in 812.M41. The workforce of the industrial world Luxor rose up against the cruel regime of the ruling Oligarchs. As a lynch-pin of the Helioret Sector, itself crucial to the supply lines of the northern Ultima Segmentum, the loss of the planet could leave hundreds of worlds vulnerable to attack. The Ultramarines and Novamarines Chapters launched a swift counter-attack before all Imperial resistance was defeated. In this campaign also took part the Cadian 98th Armoured Regiment.[3a] Although vastly outnumbered, the Space Marines and the surviving loyal workers, were able to crush the rebels and their Alpha Legion masters, returning Luxor to Imperial control in less than a year.
Magdelene IX	Magdelene IX is a former Imperial Shrine World. In 023996.M41 it fell under the threat of Waaagh! Garaghak and was besieged by a combined Ork force of Skalk Bluetoof's Death Skulls and various Goff warbands, spearheaded by Buzzgob's Dreadheadz. Defended by Frateris Militia, thousands of cultists of Red Redemption and Sisters of Battle of the Order of the Black Selpulchre and Order of the Argent Shroud it eventually fell in 866996.M41 due to the lack of Imperial reinforcements after the fall of Forsarr and was immediatly claimed by Garaghak himself. In 476998.M41 , under pressure from Ecclesiarchy the 73rd Harakoni Warhawks were deployed on Magdelene IX in a desperate planetfall which predictably failed with heavy losses. Magdelene IX remains in Ork hands and in 995999.M41 Orks of Waaagh! Garaghak are mustering on the planet to continue their war against the Imperium. Most benevolent Lord of the Administratum I beseech thee... for over seventy years the Emperor's divine rule over the Forsarr Sector of Segmentum Tempestus has been threatened and harassed by a growing Ork menace - the Arch-Killa Garaghak, name him not, the cruellest of foes, may his name be forever cursed.
Lorentian IV	Lorentian IV is a world of the Imperium, known to raise regiments for the Astra Militarum.
Ullden	Ullden was an Imperium Agri World which stood on the brink of ruin after the beasts there grew sterile. In desperation, its population began to pray to an ancient fertility God and believed their prayers were answered, when their beasts were able to become fertile again. However, it was the Great Unclean One Rotigus who had heard their prayers and doomed Ullden by making the pregnant beasts give birth to a neverending tide of shrieking mutated newborns.
Hevaran	Hevaran is a world of the Imperium. During the Horus Heresy, the planet willingly joined the Traitor cause. In the subsequent Great Scouring it was the site of a major battle as Rogal Dorn personally led his Imperial Fists against Perturabo's Iron Warriors.[2b] After the battle, Dorn declared that the world would never be rebuilt as a testament to its crimes, the laxity of faith, and a reminder to the sacrifices of the Imperial Fists. A shard of Rogal Dorn's armour remained on the planet after the battle.[2a] Ten thousand years later, Hevaran remained a "ruinworld" with an impoverished population.[2c] After the Great Rift, the planet fell into anarchy and came under the control of Iron Warriors led by the Warsmith Torven Vakra. However a group of loyalist pilgrims still waged a desperate guerrilla struggle against the traitors until a group of Black Templars under High Marshal Helbrecht arrived in search of the lost shard of Dorn's armour.[2c] In the subsequent battle, the Black Templars and remaining loyal pilgrims were able to defeat the Iron Warriors and liberate the planet once more.[2d]
Vaust	Vaust is an Imperial Hive World. During the occupation of Hive Secundus of this planet, the Cyclops Demolition Vehicles of the Mordian 201st Iron Guard Regiment were used for crowd control. It was part of the empire of Cardinal Bucharis during the Plague of Unbelief, but later one of the earliest planets to revolt under the influence of Confessor Dolan Chirosius.
Cavolotus V	Cavolotus V was the site of a battle involving the Ultramarines Legion during the Great Crusade.
Oruscar Dynasty	The Oruscar Dynasty is a Necron Dynasty noted as once being bitter rivals with the Sautekh Dynasty.[1a] While the power of the Sautekh was spread wide throughout the galaxy, the Oruscar's holdings were limited to a handful of ancestral worlds laden with technological wonders. The rivalry has not ended since the reawakening of the Necrons. Both dynasties are pursuing the wider goal of reclaiming the galaxy, but may one day come to clash with one another once more.[1a] The Oruscar Dynasty is known to possess a powerful ancient artefact known as the Celestial Orrery on the Tomb World of Thanatos.[1b] This has resulted in long-running siege by enemies in search for the device, first the Word Bearers and next fellow Necrons of the Kardenath Dynasty. The defence of the Orrery is the duty of a cabal of Crypteks known as the Conclave of Celestial Guardians.
Sorcerer	Chaos Sorcerers are Psykers who choose to follow Chaos. Chaos Space Marine Sorcerers are the counterpart to loyalist Space Marine Librarians. The first Chaos Space Marine Sorcerers emerged from the ranks of the Thousand Sons before and during the Horus Heresy. Some of these Sorcerers were exiled after the Rubric of Ahriman was cast and they now sell their services in exchange for sacrifices or the chance to hunt down arcane lore. Only the World Eaters destroyed their Sorcerers, Khorne having no interest in sorcery. If a Librarian overreaches himself and draws on too much psychic energy he may be granted visions of immortality and whispered promises of power. Most Sorcerers are granted gifts by their god, which further enhance their psychic powers. They are also often selfish madmen, believing themselves superior to all others and on a mighty quest for power and knowledge to increase their mental fortitude and develop new ways of using their powers. Often the visions given to Sorcerers are unattainable, subsequently driving them to extremes in their desire to achieve these goals.
Battle of Fordris	The Battle of Fordris was fought on the world of Fordris between the Necrons and Orks of Waaagh! Skullkrak. Ork Warboss Skullrak had led his boyz to the ghost world of Fordris, pursuing rumors of ancient weaponry to be plundered and used in his campaign against the Raven Guard Space Marines. However, Fordris was not uninhabited and the Orks discovered it was very much an active Tomb World holding legions of Necron Warriors. Unleashing a devastating volley of Gauss Flayer fire into the Ork lines in phalanx formation, the Orks were cut down and Skullrak himself only survived by using one of his boyz as a shield. However the Orks kept charging at the Necrons, taking no heed to their losses and soon the battle erupted into a vicious melee. Ripping the Necrons apart and seemingly victorious, the Orks began to celebrate but their victory was cut short when the Necrons regeneration circuits kicked in and the mechanical legion was upon Skullrak once more. This scene would replay itself all across Fordris: the Orks' ferocity bore the Necrons to the ground, but again and again the fallen put themselves back together to fight once more.
Saint's Lament	Saint's Lament is a desolate Imperial world, that contains Extractor-shrines and which has become invaded by Ork Speed Freaks in M42. However it was also infested by a Genestealer Cult, whose mechanized forces are now fighting the invaders on Lament's dusty plains.
Posul	Posul was the homeworld to the Mortifactors Space Marine Chapter. Posul was a Feral Night World, shrouded in perpetual darkness. It was the homeworld to the Mortifactors Space Marine Chapter and was inhabited by fierce nomadic tribes that were known to practice cannibalism, eating the flesh of their slain enemies and ritually gaining strength from this barbaric practice. These tribes were in constant combat with each other, creating a population suited to be Space Marines and excellent at fighting in low-light conditions. The priestly class of the natives were often recruited to the Mortifactors' Chaplaincy.
Anemae Gulfward	Anemae Gulfward is a planet in the Helican Subsector, part of the Scarus Sector. It was here that Alizebeth Bequin recruited the Astropath Tesaera Ungish.
Olympia	Olympia was the Homeworld to the Iron Warriors Space Marine Legion. Olympia was originally a rugged, mountainous world whose population was concentrated within many city states, spread across the planet's surface. The planet had vast amount of stone available and as such large fortresses were built, and controlling the paths through the mountains and the high ground was very important to military security. One of the city states, the home to the Primarch Perturabo, was named Lochos. The leader of Lochos, known as the Tyrant of Lochos, dominated the region. When The Emperor arrived, he granted Perturabo a Space Marine Legion. He used this new force to depose the Tyrant of Lochos and take control of the planet. He recruited from the population of Olympia and joined The Emperor on his Great Crusade. Much later, just prior to the Heresy, Perturabo, already shaken by the Sak'trada Deeps Campaign, learned that Olympia was in rebellion against him. Governor Dammekos had passed away, and in the power vacuum left after his death the Olympian lords had resumed their politicking and bickering. In truth however, the rebellion was covertly engineered by the Word Bearers.
Koradrum	Koradrum is a cold Imperium world consisting of small villages and settlements. In M41 Darred Lenhema, one of the Scarus Sector's most admired archaeologists, led a team to Koradrum in order to excavate an ancient burial site there. Lenhema specialised in human remains from the era of Mankind's First Expansion into space and thought he would find more of these remains, when his team opened one of the burial site's mounds. Instead contact was lost with Lenhema afterwards. Two years later, Inquisitor Eisenhorn and the bounty hunter Harlon Nayl arrived on Koradrum, to discover what had happened to the archaeologist. They soon found their answer within the burial mound Lenhema had opened, as the dead bodies of the archaeologist and his team lay within it - as well as a Necron Lord, who had killed them. After seeing the Necron, Eisenhorn and Nayl both fired upon it and, though they survived the encounter, it is not known what became of the Necron Lord or Koradrum afterwards.
Kiavahr	Kiavahr is a Forge World whose moon, Deliverance, houses the Fortress Monastery of the Raven Guard Space Marine Chapter. The planet also houses a Titan Legion known as the Legio Vindictus. Kiavahr is populated by billions of craftsmen and workers who work and reside in the many hive cities and fabrication plants which cover the planet's surface. Together with Deliverance, the two worlds produce an amount of ordnance and war machines almost equal to a Forge World. The planet's atmosphere is highly toxic - a result of millennia of industrial pollution - which results in incidences of mutation far above the normal levels. This level of mutation stretches the tolerance of the Adeptus Ministorum, but the volume and quality of materials the two worlds produce (and, presumably, the presence of the Raven Guard) mean that more leeway is granted than would usually be the case. Kiavahr has four moons but only the closest moon, Deliverance, is inhabited. The outer three moons (Psophis, Mellori and Nyctimus) are Dead Worlds.
Harakon	Harakon is a low gravity Hive World in which the hive spires reach high into the upper atmosphere. The population of Harakon is high and as such they produce large numbers of Imperial Guard Regiments, the Harakoni Warhawks. Below the spires are mountain passes in which the Harakonis use grav-gliders to hunt the native Vapourwyrms. The dominant dialect on Harakon is Konndar.
Soryth	Soryth is a Mining World in the Calixis Sector, that makes its money from frozen gas mining.

Urrghaz	Urrghaz is a world of the galaxy. A Space Wolves strike force once fought a series of battles against the Orks here amidst the planet's chain-fortresses.
Gas Giant	Gas Giants are worlds composed largely of gases, that surround a solid core. Their gasses are harvested by both the Imperium and Tau Empire through the use of their ships. The Imperium will also place permanent installations in the orbits of Gas Giants to make it easier to harvest and refine their gasses. Tyranid hive fleets also do minor harvesting of gas giants and comet clouds. Some Gas Giants have breathable upper atmospheres, which allows the Imperium to use Anti-grav Mining Platforms and its atmospheric aircraft. They can also have Fauna that dwell in their atmospheres.
Kaurava I	Kaurava I is the central world of the Kaurava system.
Pyran	Pyran is a Civilised World of the Imperium whose inhabitants are governed by a strict caste system. It is the homeworld of Imperial Guard Regiments known as the Pyran Dragoons. Originally colonised by the Imperium in M34, not long before the Sinto Uprising took place in the Justicar Sub-Sector, which led to a rise in incidents involving Chaos raiders in the region. One of the units raised to counter this were the Tyler Grenadiers Imperial Guard Regiments, which were deployed on Pyran after a series of actions that had left the Grenadiers extremely depleted of manpower. Despite being understrength, the Grenadiers were able to hold Pyran against the Chaos incursions, bringing the raiders to battle in an ambush outside the planet's only town. The Grenadiers won a decisive victory which forced the Chaos army to retreat from Imperial space entirely. Following this, the Grenadiers' Colonel declared Right of Conquest, claiming Pyran and settling the regiments' survivors on the planet - the only time in recorded Imperial history that the Right has been invoked over a planet in the Armageddon sub-sector.
Gelmiro System	The Gelmiro System is a planetary system in the Calixis Sector. The Hive Worlds of the Gelmiro System in the Calixis Sector fell into sedition, following the charismatic leadership of a figure calling himself the Emperor of Brass, debasing themselves into the worship of the Ruinous Powers. Heavily militarised, the renegades quickly sponsored and armed rebel groups on nearby worlds and when counter-attacked, revealed the hand of dark forces from the Eye of Terror in their ranks. The so-called War of Brass that followed was comparably brief but bloody, involving forces drawn from across the sector, and the involvement of the Adeptus Astartes and the Titans of Legio Venator, it rendered the once thriving worlds of Gelmiro blasted, rubble strewn rocks. Classified as War Worlds and the haunt of murderous scav-mutants, renegades and wreakers ever since, while the reign of the Emperor of Brass is long over, the system is still a shunned no-man’s land to this day.

Days later, the Brazen Beasts placed the Sorcerers' skulls on the Fortress' battlements for the glory of the Blood God.

Later, it was released in both e-book and MP3 format with a run time of 3 hours and 40 minutes and read by Jonathan Keeble. The novella tells the story of Sor Talgron and the 34th Chapter of Word Bearers from their leaving their station on Terra to join the Retribution Fleet to their joining with Lorgar in the Shadow Crusade. He and the Dark Apostle Jaruleth take the fight to Percepton Primus, Percepton System of Ultramar, and battle against the forces of Ultramarines 17th Chapter Master Aecus Decimus. The Shadow Crusade spreads across Ultramar, with the Word Bearers 34th Company falling upon the isolated world of Percepton Primus. As the fighting draws out into a programme of extermination, embittered commander Sor Talgron begins to question his part in Lorgar’s grander scheme – for one who stood beside primarchs and high lords in the grand halls of the Imperial Palace, what glory can there now be in punishing Guilliman’s upstart sons? But the price of doubt is known all too well, and if the Word Bearers are ever to return to Terra in triumph then they must purge the last remnants of such unbelief from the face of the galaxy...
Valos	Valos is a barren, Dead World on the Eastern Fringe of the Ultima Segmentum, to the galactic southeast of Ultramar.[Needs Citation] During the Horus Heresy, Valos became a battleground between Loyalist and Traitor forces, suffering an atomic bombardment that boiled away the planet's oceans.

Diocese	A diocese is a region of the Imperium as divided by the Adeptus Ministorum. Each is headed by a Cardinal who might control hundreds of Preachers within the diocese.[1a] Each diocese originally encompassed hundreds of worlds.[1a] Ecclesiarch Sebastian Thor, as part of his reforms following the Age of Apostasy, reduced the size of a diocese and therefore limited the individual power of each Cardinal, making it harder for any one Cardinal to gain too much power.[1b] In the modern Imperium, a single Diocese generally encompasses an entire world.

It has the distinction of being besieged by two separate enemies of the Imperium, both of which were defeated by the actions of Commissar Ciaphas Cain, the reluctant Hero of the Imperium. Perlia has two continents. The eastern continent is mostly mountainous desert, while the western continent contains much of the planet's industry and civilization centers, including the planetary capital of Havensdown[Needs Citation]. In the 920s.M41, the planet came under siege by a Waaagh! led by Warlord Gargash Korbul, who had also besieged several worlds in the sector.[1a] The Imperial Guard had been sent in order to quell the Waaagh!; among the regiments was the Valhallan 12th Field Artillery and its regimental commissar, Ciaphas Cain. Separated from his regiment and other Imperial forces during a battle in orbit, Cain crash-landed in the deserts of the eastern continent. Along with his ever-present (and ever-odiferous) aide, Ferik Jurgen, Cain journeyed across the desert, meeting up with elements of the Perlian PDF and civilians liberated from Ork captivity, forming them into a ragtag army in what became the "March of the Liberator". Thanks to Cain's actions, including a duel to the death with Warlord Korbul,[1c] Perlia was liberated. Cain became an instant hero on Perlia, and many statues and monuments appeared praising him. After reconstruction, the town of Prosperity Wells on the eastern continent - where the "March of the Liberator" had begun - was rechristened "Cainstead"[1b] (a fact that Cain himself found both hilarious and embarrassing).[2a] In Havensdown, a clock was set in Liberation Square, showing a clockwork commissar (obviously representing Cain) beheading the number of clockwork Orks that corresponded to the time - another edifice that Cain disliked intensely.[2b]
Morwen VI	This airless and dead world has aroused interest in members of the Adeptus Mechanicus throughout the Calixis Sector due to the numerous oddities that can be found there. Structures found on the planet's surface are thought to be the remains of settlements, though whichever civilisation lived on the planet was wiped out, or abandoned the world, some several millennia prior to its discovery by the Imperium in 675.M41. That the planet was once home to organic life is beyond reasonable dispute, as significant deposits of oil and natural gas have been found on the world. Such resources are important to the Imperium, and as a result a regiment of Imperial Guard are stationed on Morwen VI whilst the equipment needed to extract the fossil fuel is organised and transported to the world.
Hamooth	Hamooth is an Agri World of the Imperium. The Iron Hands Chapter once fought a Tyranid Splinter Fleet there.
Pilgrim's Pause	Pilgrim's Pause is a Cemetery World in the Calixis Sector. The Cult of the Seven Silences spread their heresy to this world.
Letum	Letum is an Ork Frontier World and the 6th world of the Annihilius System in the Periphery Sub-Sector in the Calixis Sector. Letum is a temperate and agreeable world of broad savannahs, rolling, grass-covered plains, vast, sweeping steppe land, and low and ancient mountains. It is blessed with untold hectares of fertile, arable land, and numerous, easy to reach veins of strategically important ores and precious gems. Until a few centuries ago, Letum was nothing more than a footnote on a chart of possible inhabitable worlds drawn up for a Rogue Trader house who made their money shuttling colonists to and from the Calixis Sector. Recently rediscovered by an Imperial Navy reconnaissance group, Letum shows no sign of ever having been inhabited by humans. Further study by both the Imperial Navy and the Adeptus Mechanicus revealed no man or xenos-made structures anywhere on the world, and a generally unspoilt planet, ripe for colonization and exploitation.
Tyringal	Tyringal was an Imperial world that was once held by Drukhari slavers. This ended with the arrival of Colonel Aldalon and his Catachan 57th Jungle Fighters Regiment, who defeated the Xenos and sent them fleeing. Tyringal's population then celebrated their freedom with an immense fireworks display, before the Catachans departed for other warzones. They were still celebrating 6 months later, when the vengeful Drukhari returned and completely destroyed Tyringal with a darklight weapon in retribution.
Gatera	Gatera lies within the Dark Imperium and was the site of a battle for the Blood Ravens' forces, led by Captain Atanaxis.
Tanakreg	Tanakreg was an Imperial-held world until its destruction at the hands of the Word Bearers Chaos Space Marine legion. Tanakreg was known for its formidable air-defence network and its immense salt mines. It was also home to a Necron Monolith, buried deep within the planet's crust. The planet was attacked and devastated by the Word Bearers in M41.[Needs Citation] Tanakreg saw the construction of a Gehemehnet, an immense Chaos entity built from the remains of the capital city and bodies of the dead. It was presumed that this massive tower was to transform the planet into a Daemon World, but instead was used to shatter the planet's crust and reveal the Monolith beneath.[Needs Citation]
Teliox Epis	Teliox Epis was a gas giant of the galaxy.
Sheol XVII	Sheol XVII is an asteroid in the Calixis Sector. It is a penal colony and Adeptus Mechanicus outpost for those convicted of Tech-Heresy. It lies in the icy outer sphere of a star with no name other than a blank codifier sequence. It is built around a jagged ferrous asteroid mass, with an open framework of struts and pipes that carry life support feeds to the sealed units that hang like nests in the branches of a tree. Each unit is up to half a kilometre in length and holds up to a thousand breathing souls. When the Mechanicus is certain that their Heresy does not reveal some truth or lead to accomplices yet unpunished, prisoners are turned into Servitors and a Rune of Sheol burned into their skin as a warning to others. Upon arrival, the Tech-Priests strip prisoners of any nonessential cybernetic implants and inter them in arcane life-support chambers known as Expurgation Bays where Archivids - spindly Servitor constructs that resemble the arachnids of ancient Terra - torture information out of the prisoners using Expurgation Bays. Subjects resistant to this go to The Spire, Magos Interrogus and Excruciator Servitors extracting the truth from the most unwilling of subjects. When the Servitors or obtain a pre-set amount of data, they convey it to the Vault of Censure, at the deepest point beneath the spire, for partitioning, analysis, and archiving.
Inferno! (2020) Vol.5	Inferno! Volume 5 is the fifth release in the Inferno! anthology series. Inferno! Volume 5 showcases some of the best new fiction from across Warhammer’s many universes: from the unending darkness of the war-torn 41st Millennium, to the gang-infested Underhive of Necromunda, through to the tumultuous lands of the Chaos-ravaged Mortal Realms.
Naogeddon	Naoggedon is a Dead World, the location where the C'tan known as Deceiver went into stasis. It is known to Imperial authorities as a world upon which Explorator teams regularly disappear without trace. Nothing is known of Naogeddon's past, save that it was the site the Deceiver entered stasis upon. It was discovered by Imperial authorities in the year 751.M32, by the Rogue Trader Xiatal Parnevue. Two Explorator landings took place: one led by Magos Dural Lavank 021.M35, the other led by Magos Prime Holisen Zi in 238.M37; both teams were lost. A third landing, in the year 641.M41 was more successful, in that it was able to log surface structures of ancient Xenos origin and report limited evidence of archaeotech. A follow-up investigation under the same Magos, Explorator Magos Prime Reston Egal, took place later in the 41st millennium. This expedition was also ultimately lost. An arid world with 0% precipitation, Naogeddon supports no life. The desert terrain is riven by constant storms of such power that they make atmospheric flight difficult at best and downright dangerous at worst. The storms propel mica shards at significant speeds. The constant storms shroud the surface of the planet in a dark gloom, as the light of the nearest sun is mostly reflected by the mica, or otherwise unable to pierce the dust-cover.
Steel Daemon (Novella)	Steel Daemon is a novella by Ian St. Martin. The Thirteenth Black Crusade has been unleashed.

For the Imperial soldiers that oppose them, it is a battle for survival. Separated from his unit, airman Heit Lytviak finds himself thrust into the front lines among the hardened veterans of a Cadian tank battalion. Forced to experience the full horror of war like never before, Heit must find an inner strength to stand against the darkness. But will it be enough to save him?

Barathrum (Short Story)	Words of Blood is a compilation of short stories set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe edited by Christian Dunn and Marc Gascoigne. It was first published in 2002. Author: Ben Counter Commander Athellenas and 30 Space Marines of Black Templars are all that stand in the way of a traitorous army devoted to the Blood God.

When Stern led four Grey Knights to Sargotha in order to banish M'Kachen, they were ambushed amidst the world's obsidian pyramids by the Lord of Change's Daemon forces. By the battles end though, the Daemons were defeated, but Stern was the only Grey Knight who survived and M'Kachen escaped from the world unscathed.
Markayn Marches	The Markayn Marches are a region of Imperial space, located in the Calixis Sector in Segmentum Obscurus.
Adsecularis	Adsecularis, also known as Tech-Thralls, are menial laborers used by the Adeptus Mechanicus. Despite the never ending back-breaking service to the Mechanicus, they still try to have some semblance of society. Adsecularis have the same hopes and desires as Imperials on other worlds do and a rare few are even defiant against their fate. However their spirits are worn thin by the drudgery of their existence at the Mechanicus' hands. There are some Adsecularis who have become so mentally broken by their life, that they become mute and numb to the world. Those that do so, will then be obediently compliant to whatever authority figure gives them orders, even if they are not given by the Mechanicus. Considered a lower order than most Servitors, the ultimate fate of most Adsecularis is to end their lives recycled into Servitor components and their Augmetic implants harvested for further use. When a need arises for expendable servants or troops, however, the Adsecularis are deployed by the Mechanicus. Those selected are often captured prisoners or criminals and they are given basic Augmetics and cranial surgery in the process. When deployed in combat, Adsecularis are armed with a variety of light weapons such as Shotguns, Chainblades, Las-Locks and Mitralocks.

Hesperax	Hesperax was a former Dark Eldar world in the Eye of Terror. Never touched by sunlight, the ever present dark clouds bathe Hesperax in cold darkness.[1a] In the past, the Archon Sussarkh the Kabal Slayer ruled the Kabals and Wych Cults on the planet. Sussarkh made the world run slick with blood as he turned them against one another in perpetual combat, bringing the world to the brink of its own ruin. While sitting on his throne on the highest peak of a volcano, Sussarkh asked his consort, the breathtaking Lelith Hesperax of the Wych Cult of Strife, to dance for him, as he watched the bloodshed below. As she began her dance, Lelith danced between Sussarkh's retinue as lightning flashed and black rain began to pore down on them.[1a] Unknown to Sussarkh, Lelith had struck a contract with a Daemon of Slaanesh. She would be given the power to stop the mindless slaughter and instead have it done in a grand gladiatorial arena. All it would take to sign the contract was the soul of the Archon himself.[1b] As she finished her dance, Sussarkh noticed his retinue had stopped moving and began to fall apart. Lelith had killed them skilfully during her dance leaving Sussarkh undefended. He raised his sword to battle Lelith, only to find that he too, had been cut and he watched as his body fell apart. With a skilful dance, Wych Queen Lelith, became the new ruler of Hesperax.[1a] In the coming years Lelith, and the Wych Cult of Strife, strengthened their hold on the planet and began to fulfil her contract with the Daemon. She had a gladiatorial arena built, into the very volcano, where she had killed Sussarkh. There Lelith had her throne built, so she could watch over the spectacle of the gladiatorial fights and watch the gallons of blood being spilled every day in her honour.[1a] Her Daemonic patron had already granted Lelith numerous favours and had offered her assistance to ensure the longevity of the Wych Queen's rule on Hesperax itself. In return, Lelith had promised the Daemon enough souls to push its Slaaneshi army out of the warp and into the material realm.[1b]

Seco	Seco is a Kroot world that was discovered by the Tau Empire, during its Third Sphere of Expansion.
Nymidae	Nymidae is a recruitment world for the Dark Angels Chapter. In M41 it was invaded by a combined force of the Necron Xonthar Dynasty, led by Overlord Varagon Drakvir, and the Death Guard, led by Typhus. The alliance between them was made as each would benefit from the Dark Angels losing control of Nymidae: for the Xonthar Dynasty they would claim Nymidae as their own, as it was unknowingly to the Imperium a Necron Tomb World, with countless Necrons sleeping beneath its surface, while the Death Guard would claim the Dark Angels' secrets that laid within their Fortress of Redemption. They did not count, however, on the tenacity of the Dark Angels defending Nymidae, who were led by Grand Master Azrael, nor did they know that a Blood Angels force, led by Captain Tycho, would come to the Dark Angels' aid. Once the Blood Angels made planetfall, the two Chapters fought side by side and though they suffered heavy casualties, they defeated the Necrons and Death Guard's forces and drove them off of Nymidae.

Orestes	Orestes is a Forge World and a Knight World of the Imperium. A major supplier for the Sabbat Worlds Crusade, Orestes was attacked by a grand horde of Chaos Titans in 779.M41. The Forge's own force of God-Machines, the Legio Tempestus, was severely depleted through constant tithes to the Crusade, and stood no hope of holding off the hordes of Chaos. As luck would have it, the Legio Invicta was travelling past Orestes on their way to the Crusade main front after crushing a force of Eldar in the Beltran Cluster, and Lord Gearhart of Invicta came to the Forge's aid. Orestes was liberated from Chaos within weeks, although the southernmost hives were destroyed in the fighting, and a great many engines and Imperial Guard were lost.
Argovon System	The Argovon System is located within the Nephilim Sector. The Argovon System has been in Imperial records for at laest 8,000 years. Local myth talks of a great hero called Foronika Argovon, a Rogue Trader who discovered the system. Though hailed and glorified in the Imperial records, it is likely she was instead from a long-disgraced and heavily impoverished Rogue Trader Household. By sheer fortune she happened across the region and its enormous material wealth. During M42, it was invaded by the Necron and became a part of the Pariah Nexus, after they built a network of Noctilith Pylons within it. The System later was the site of a battle between the Xenos and the Indomitus Crusade's Battle Group Kallides, who sought to reclaim its worlds.
Berzerker	Khorne Berzerkers are Chaos Space Marines dedicated entirely to glorifying the Chaos God Khorne through hand to hand combat. Driven by bloodlust, their only purpose is to kill and destroy their enemies in the name of Khorne. Eschewing long ranged weaponry, Berzerkers make almost exclusive use of close combat weapons, in particular the chainaxe. Chainswords, scimitars, ritual knives, Bolt Pistols, and other brutal close-quarters weapons are also frequently used. However, they are known to use almost anything as a weapon at times, often continuing fighting even when in possession of no offensive weapons other than their own bodies. The original Berzerkers came from the World Eaters Legion under their Primarch Angron. By ritualized psycho-surgery known as the Butcher's Nails, he removed all sense of fear and danger and then heightened the bloodlust his soldiers experienced in combat. When Angron swore himself to the Blood God Khorne, the original Berzerkers were no longer bound by Imperial dogma and were given full reign to embrace their bloodthirsty skills. They have since become the ultimate shock troops of Chaos, entering an uncontrollable frenzy during battle. After the Battle of Skalathrax, most World Eaters Berzerkers formed separated warbands and many bastardized practices of their psycho-surgery spread to other Chaos Space Marine forces with them. Not all Berzerkers are the original World Eaters of Angron however, those Chaos Space Marines who wish to fully dedicate themselves to Khorne usually join a World Eaters warband and undergo the Butcher's Nails. Once the procedure is complete, they also feel nothing but the desire to kill, maim, and burn. Khorne Berzerkers are rightly feared by friend and foe alike, and in accordance with their will to please the god of war Berzerkers find the need to spill "Blood for the Blood God" overpowering. They are known to kill even their own allies if caught in the heat of battle or lacking alternative adversaries, a situation epitomized by Khârn the Betrayer. Their battle prowess has earned them a fearsome reputation on the battlefield, although it also leads to them being unable to form a single, cohesive and mutually supportive unit. Berzerker bands vary in size and strength, often lending their aid to whichever side offers them the greatest chance of combat and slaughter. Abaddon the Despoiler and his Black Legion in particular utilize large numbers of Berzerkers. Going a step further, Abaddon has recruited a number of highly-skilled Berzerker-surgeons to his cause, allowing the Black Legion to produce new Berzerkers in numbers that approach that of the World Eaters.
Galavan	Galavan is an Imperial Jungle World covered in dense tropical growth. Its primary exports are timber and pharmaceuticals. Rainstorms on the planet are frequent, sudden, and heavy enough to stun an unprotected person. These storms have become proverbial on other worlds in the subsector, whose inhabitants often joke that Galavan's native inhabitants are not human at all, but rather mutants with gills. The Ordo Malleus of the Inquisition (which is not known for its sense of humour) has investigated these rumours and found them to be without basis in fact.
Ruhr III	Ruhr III is an Imperium world[1a] that contains hundreds of cities and many mining sites for its vast resources.[1d] However, attacks by Chaos Cultists signaled the beginning of a disaster[1a] that nearly destroyed Ruhr III.[1i] The Cultists attacked in hordes, but Ruhr III's PDF was able to keep them at bay long enough for a Ultramarines strike force to arrive. The strike force soon forced the Cultists to fall back[1a] and the Ultramarines were able to locate and attack their leader's base. When the Ultramarines invaded the base however, they discovered the Cult's leader was a Word Bearer and his death at their hands[1b], caused the Traitor Legion to begin a full scale invasion of Ruhr III. The Word Bearers and Cultists emerged from the world's ashen wastes in such numbers[1c], that they easily outnumbered the Ultramarines[1d], and they began spreading corruption across the world's surface[1e]. This brought about numerous threats that the Ultramarines were forced to deal with, all while doing what they could to slow down the Word Bearers advance. Chief among, was the capture of a heretical Imperial Commander[1f] and the arrival of an Ordo Malleus Inquisitor who came to investigate the corruption on Ruhr III, but who later needed to be saved, when his convoy was attacked by the Word Bearers[1g]. Eventually the Ultramarines were able to turn the tide, when they found the source of the corruption beneath one of the world's cities; though, it was then necessary to destroy the city and its population, to ensure the corruption's threat to Ruhr III was ended.[1h] They then received much needed aid in the form of a Grey Knights strike force, which arrived to destroy the Bloodletterss the Word Bearers had begun summoning on the world's surface. The Ultramarines would lend some of its forces to aid the Grey Knights in their task and once a number of the Daemons were destroyed, they agreed to aid in the battle against the Word Bearers[1d]. It was shortly after this, that they discovered the Word Bearers's ultimate goal on Ruhr III was to use the blood spilled during their attacks to summon a Bloodthirster to the world's surface. The Greater Daemon was of such power, that if the Word Bearers were successful, it would cause numerous Imperial Systems to fall to the forces of Chaos. This brought about the final battles of the invasion, as the Ultramarines and Grey Knights quickly attacked the site[1d], where a Dark Apostle was conducting a ritual to summon the Bloodthirster. Despite the numerous foes defending the site, the Ultramarines and Grey Knights were successful and disrupted the ritual just as the Bloodthirster was possessing the Dark Apostle. Though the Greater Daemon was able to materialize on Ruhr III, without the ritual to sustain the Bloodthirster, its body exploded and it was banished back to the Warp. The summoning's failure dealt a crippling blow to the Word Bearers, that they could not recover from and the forces of Chaos were then purged from Ruhr III's surface[1j]. The world was left devastated though, as millions were killed in the invasion and a hundred cities had been destroyed.[1d]
Iesta Veracrux	Iesta Veracrux is an Agri World that belonged to the Imperium at the onset of the Horus Heresy.[1a] The world is known for its prosperous wine industry[1a] which supplies wines to the entire Ultima Segmentum.[1c] One of the wines made on Iesta Veracrux is the pungent Estufagemi wine.[1a] As part of the Taebian Sector, the world is heavily dependent on the Eurotas Trade Consortium for its economic health.[1c]

Lotus (Daemon World)	Lotus is a small Daemon World in the Maelstrom, devoted to Slaanesh. Its rolling hills and tree-lined vistas are a riot of colour and sound, and the air is filled with cloying perfumes. The world has a deadly secret, though. Called by the din of battle, or perhaps the promise of fresh minds to corrupt, a sickly-sweet mist rises from hidden orifices in the ground. Any who are caught unawares will soon find their judgement clouded and their thoughts subverted, until they are blissfully unaware and ripe for the soul-harvest that will doubtless follow.
Duala	Duala is an Imperium world that lies near the Damocles Gulf. In the aftermath of Cadia's destruction during the 13th Black Crusade, Duala was invaded by Daemons. Duala was among a series of worlds in the area that have suffered the same fate and the Inquisition may quarantine the worlds, rather than save them.
Hervara	Hervara is a Forge World in the Calixis Sector. Under Severus I, was colonized as a Mining World and extensive mining operations, continue in pursuit of the world’s natural ore resources to this day. Adeptus Mechanicus during the Great Crusade had colonized the planet millennia earlier, but abandoned their work when the Crusade waned. These facilities were looted by Orks which left their spores. The remaining ruins jump-started the planet into quickly becoming a Forge World. Hervara has no moons or other larger satellites. As part of the war effort to secure the Periphery Sub-Sector from the myriad threats that loom over it is an ongoing struggle for the Imperial forces of the Spinward Front. Duke Severus XIII sent one of his best commanders—General Mikhail Augustus. Units of the Imperial Hervara Excavatory Warriors turned against their brethren creating an initial beachhead. Ork Oddboyz, under the tutelage and guidance of the cunning and brutally inventive Big Mek Noshdakka, has substantially altered the ongoing war effort with wings of Bommas. Hervara is physically located along one of the Warp routes that lead between the heart of the Calixis Sector and the region which Severus claims as the Severan Dominate. Near the edge of the Periphery Sub-Sector, the world saw regular traffic from both the worlds of the frontier and those of the Sector.

During Operation Newfound, the second phase of the Sabbat Worlds Crusade, a combined force of Imperial Guard and the Collegia Titanica set out to reclaim the world, as part of Warmaster Slaydo's advance to the stronghold world of Balhaut. The Imperial force, commanded by Marshal Blackwood, encountered the bizarre war machines created by the Chaos commander, Heritor Asphodel. Blackwood petitioned Slaydo for Titan reinforcements, pleading that no matter how many men he had under his command, they would be shredded by the Heritor's "woe machines" like so much chaff.
Lodius	Lodius is a planet in the Sabbat Worlds Cluster, held by Chaos.

It was published in November 2015, in tandem with The Unburdened by David Annandale, as part of the collection Betrayal at Calth (Anthology). In the immediate aftermath of the Word Bearers' attack on Calth, survivors from both sides were driven into the subterranean arcology shelters by the tortured Veridian star. While their primarch Roboute Guilliman had planned for many seemingly unthinkable eventualities, the Ultramarines now face a new war in the underworld - could Steloc Aethon, renowned captain of 'the Honoured 19th' Company, be the one to lead them to ultimate victory over the traitors? Perhaps, if he can master his own bitter desire for vengeance...
Tsade II	Trade II is an Agri World in the Josian Reach Subsector of the Calixis Sector. Tsade II provides its Imperial Tithe in sheef-corn. It also provides foodstuffs to the hives of Fenksworld.

Regardless, Battlefleet Calixis has been dispatched to investigate. The Balefruit Festival is celebrated on this world.
Minea	Minea is a Hive World in the Ultima Segmentum, with a population of 154,000,000,000, a moderate Imperial Navy presence, a 2,000,000-strong garrison, and a planetary draft of 1,249,000 per annum. Other than the Imperial Guard tithe base, its main exports are banedax ore and phosgene gas. It is estimated to be about thirty-five months warp travel from Terra. At one point, a Warp Rift was opened on Minea at the top of a hive tower by a rogue psyker named Gutor Invareln, summoning a Keeper of Secrets and its retinue of Slaaneshi Daemons. A squadron of Iron Knights led by Commander Goedendag Morningstar fought their way to the top of the tower and sealed the rift by killing Invareln.
Tan	Tan was a world of the Imperium that was destroyed by Hive Fleet Kraken. After the fall of Sotha, the Tyranids of Hive Fleet Kraken attacked and eventually consumed the planet Tan. During the invasion the Scythes of the Emperor guarded the orbital stations above Tan as citizens, evacuated from the planet, arrived at the stations. When the Tyranids attacked the orbital stations, the Scythes fought the xenos, buying time for the citizens to board ships that would take them out of the system.
Danik's World	Danik's World is an Imperium War World.[1a] Danik's World was once a prosperous Agri World of the Imperium before it suffered a devastating ice age that ravaged the world and its population. Its survivors asked the Imperium for aid for two millennia, but were repeatedly denied as resources were being drained by campaigns being fought against Xenos[1a] throughout the Ultima Segmentum[1c]. This constant denial of aid for Danik's World finally caused a majority of the world's population to rebel under the leadership of Lord General Graush Vanandrasse, High Commander of Danik's World's PDF. Two years after this occurred, the Vostroyan Firstborn's Twelfth Army, under the leadership of General Vogor Vlastan, arrived to end the rebellion, but suffered several setbacks as the rebels fought back fiercely[1a]. The First Born were also unaware that Danik's World had been invaded by a large warhost of the Venomhead Ork Clan[1b]. Danik's World is now a War World being fought over by these three forces[1b] and is part of the Imperium's continued war efforts in the Second Kholdas War.[1a] Danik's World is exiting a deep ice age caused by volcanic activity. The majority of the planet is covered in glaciers and frozen wastes with a multitude of ruined cities.[1a]
Isstvan III	Isstvan III was a Hive World in the Isstvan system. Its destruction and the surrounding circumstances were the first overt signs of Warmaster Horus's turn to the forces of Chaos and the first battle of the Horus Heresy. Having been founded sometime during the Dark Age of Technology and spared many of the horrors of the Age of Strife, Isstvan III was originally assimilated into the Imperium by the Raven Guard during the Great Crusade. The Raven Guard swiftly conquered the planet, attacking from orbit at night and destroying most of its limited military capabilities in one swoop. By the time dawn rose on the Hive of Khry Vanak, Isstvan III's capital, the planetary leadership and military capability had been bombed into ruin. Aftewards, the administration of the Imperium moved in the wake of the Astartes and rebuilt the planet along the lines of the Imperial Truth.[5a] Baron Vardus Praal, Imperial governor of the Isstvan system, eventually rose in revolt against the Imperium, purging Imperial elements for as long as six years before word of the rebellion reached the Council of Terra.[5b] The Emperor of Mankind and the Council, ignorant of the change in Horus, charged the Warmaster with crushing this rebellion. Under his command were four Space Marine Legions; his own Sons of Horus, the Emperor's Children of Fulgrim, Mortarion and his Death Guard, and the World Eaters led by Angron. Horus and these Primarchs had fallen to Chaos and took this opportunity to purge all suspected loyalists from their Legions.
Periremunda	Periremunda is a sparsely-inhabited world in the Ultima Segmentum. It is notable for its geography, which consists of high plateaus surrounded by lowlands rendered uninhabitable by extreme volcanic activity.[1a] Periremunda's plateaus are climatically diverse, ranging from temperate zones to tundra to jungle. Roughly eighteen thousand of them are inhabited. Principia Urbi, the capital, occupies the entirety of the surface of Principia Mons, one of the temperate plateaus.[1b] This article needs work on its citations.For help on citation see the citation guidelines. You can help Lexicanum by fixing it.
Rhanda	Rhanda, also known as Rhanna[Needs Citation] is an Imperial Civilised World in the Segmentum Solar.[Needs Citation] Rhanda was the first planet to be conquered by Cardinal Bucharis during the Plague of Unbelief. The rich mines of the world gave Bucharis sufficient resources to build his gigantic Cardinal Palace. He also met Admiral Sehalla and Colonel Gasto here, who formed the basis of his fighting force. Later, Inquisitor Barbillus led a purge of naval aristocracy and also recruited Gholic Ren-Sar Valinov into his retinue.
Ferroxian	Ferroxian is an Imperial Penal World. Rich in ores and minerals, its climate is so harsh that it can only serve to house prisoners condemned to mine its riches as hard labor.
Gorgonum	Gorgonum is a Forge World of the Imperium, located just north of the Maelstrom. Amidst its Purgamentorums, the Ultramarines once fought with a Necron army. Once threatened by the Space Hulk named the Forsaken Doom, the Blood Angels Chapter battled in the hulk's depths against a Genestealer horde in an attempt to set off charges to break it apart before it could destroy the Forge World.
Quintarn	Quintarn is an Imperial Agri World, one of the nine worlds of Ultramar. Quintarn and its sister planets of Tarentus and Masali are collectively referred to as "The Three Planets." Unusually for Agri Worlds, the Three Planets are largely desert, but feature hundreds of dome-enclosed cities, with vast water traps, capturing moisture from the atmosphere and storing it underground. These cities support arable land and hydroponic cultivation that make Quintarn one of the most productive Agri Worlds in the Imperium, supplying foodstuffs to the rest of Ultramar, and many other planets beyond.[3a] During the War of the Beast in M32, Quintarn was invaded by Orks. The Three Planets were captured by Ork scavengers just after the battle against Hive Fleet Behemoth in 745.M41. Marneus Calgar led the forces of the Ultramarines to reconquer them[Needs Citation].
Dykastra	Dykastra became an Imperium world after being discovered by the Rogue Trader Janus Darke.
Paramar V	Paramar V is a world of the Imperium under the domain of the Adeptus Mechanicus of Gryphonne IV.[1a] At one point a life-bearing world covered in oceans, millennia before the dawn of the Imperium Paramar V was reduced to an arid, radiation-swept wasteland scoured by solar winds. The planet's atmosphere is only breathable with artificial aid and the surface temperature varies wildly (due to its thin atmosphere and slow day/night cycle). It is believed by the Mechanicum that Paramar V's composition was artificially engineered at some point in the distant past.[1a] The Paramar System, including Paramar V, is located in the northern reaches of the Segmentum Solar, in an unusually stable Warp-synchronous location in almost direct conjunction between the Isstvan System and the Sol System. Among other factors, this made Paramar V a strategically crucial planet for Horus when he led his great rebellion against the Imperium.[1a]
Phraeges III	Phraeges III is an Imperial world, that lies on the outer edges of the Red Scar. In M42, it was attacked by Orks, but the Blood Angels Chapter dispatched a strike force to aid the world. Under the watchful eyes of its Captain, the strike force has launched a full scale assault on the Xenos invaders.
Pervigilium	Pervigilium is the homeworld of the Angels of Vigilance Space Marine Chapter, located just near the Cadian Gate.
Gheistos	Gheistos was an Agri World of the Imperium. Originally a lush and peaceful world, all life on the world was destroyed in the Gheistos Cataclysm.
Bork	Bork is an Ork World in the Eastern Fringe bordering the Ghoul Stars. It was once an unremarkable frontier Industrial World, known as Bhorc Prime to Imperial forces, who controlled its light side and were in a constant struggle with Orks infesting the dark side. However one Ork, now known as Klawjaw managed to unite the Ork faction of Bork and conquered the planet in a conflict, now known as the War for Bhorc Prime. He continued his Waaagh! against the Imperium, forming the great Ork Empire of Bork.
Upsilon (World)	Upsilon is an Imperium world that serves as one of the outermost bastions of Terra's defences. This was put to the test when it was invaded by the Blood Crusade's sixth wave, in the aftermath of the Great Rift's creation. Though the Blood Crusade was ultimately defeated, it was not due to the Imperium's forces, but instead the intervention of five of Craftworld Saim-Hann's Wild Rider clans. By using their jetbikes to launch rapid strikes and then retreating before they could be attacked, the Eldar frustrated Khorne's forces to the point that the Daemons left Upsilon to find easier prey.
Yu'Kanesh	Yu'Kanesh is a desert planet colonized by the Tau.
Argonan	Argonan is an Imperium world known for its militaristic nature.
Elsy'eir	Elsy'eir is a Tau sept, a world within the Tau Empire. The sept was founded as part of the Second Sphere of Expansion. Elsy’eir is a densely populated sept and has many moons, most of which are mined for valuable ores used in the construction of battlesuits. The main production facilities for the glorious XV104 Riptides can be found upon the glittering sept world of Elsy’eir Prime. The sept also is known for poetry, artistry, and creativeness.

Gamara 12	Gamara 12 was a world reclaimed by the Imperium during the Macharian Crusade. After defeating the heretic forces on the planet, General Arrian had a million of their children put to death.
Gandian Saturnalia	Gandian Saturnalia is an Imperium world that suffered a civil war in its past.
Stygia XII	Stygia XII is a Forge World of the Imperium. Close to three thousand years prior to Stygia XII's official settlement date, Marshal Gervhart of the Black Templars founded the chapter keep of Montgisard on the planet. It served the Marshal as a base during his execution of the Athelor Crusade and following a millennium of faithful service, it was abandoned by the Black Templars. When Stygia XII was officially settled by the Imperium, the keep's remains were called Stormhelm by the settlers, who considered it a haunted xenos structure and avoided it. In 832.M41, Montgisard came into importance once more, as it became the base of operations for a Chaos Cult on Stygia XII. They began conducting a ritual to open a gate to the warp, which brought them to the attention of Inquisitor Abraham Vinculus of the Ordo Hereticus. He despatched Interrogator Edwin Savaul to besiege the keep, supported by forces from the Adepta Sororitas and Inquisitorial Stormtroopers, with orders to stop the ritual - if they failed, an exterminatus would be launched on the planet.
Tallarn	Tallarn is a harsh desert planet in Segmentum Tempestus mostly known because of its Imperial Guard Regiments, the Tallarn Desert Raiders. Discovered by Human settlers in the 29th Millennium, when it was later encountered by the Imperium during the Great Crusade it was a verdant orb of green and classified as an Agri-World. Bathed in two suns, it was blessed with plentiful and diverse biomes. It was one of the first worlds encountered by the Imperium in the Trailing Tempest region – eastwards of the primary Warp channel between Inwit and Luth Tyre. It was bloodlessly assimilated into the Imperium and used as a muster world for the Great Crusade. As a result, it was home to large ammunition, military production, and vehicle storage facilities as well as a sophisticated network of underground bunkers and shelters. However as the Great Crusade moved on, Tallarn lost its importance and by the beginning of the Horus Heresy it was considered a backwater. Tallarn's history changed radically during the subsequent Horus Heresy. During the war, the rebel Iron Warriors Legion – intending to destroy all potential resistance before landing – virus-bombed the planet from space, rendering it an inhospitable desert. Only then did the Chaos Space Marines land. Tallarn's few survivors emerged from their underground bunkers to stop the Iron Warriors' invasion.
Cold Blood (Short Story)	Cold Blood is a short story by David Guymer, a tie-in to Games Workshop's Apocalypse game. It was published online on July 22, 2013. A deadly threat lurks above the prison moon of Ixus IX... But what dwells on the surface of the airless planetoid may be deadlier still. As the Bloodlords Chaos Space Marines fall upon Ixus, intent upon slaughtering the prison inmates to fuel the hideous daemonic power of a Lord of Skulls and bring glory to the Blood God, they find a very different foe, one with no flesh to rend or blood to spill... After taking Lord of Skulls as a prize in battle against World Eaters. Bloodlords leave the Eye of Terror, making their way to the penal world of Ixus IX. After a few skirmishes and getting their Light Destroyer Bloodhammer shot down from orbit, they discover that Necrons have already purged the moon of all life. Lord of Skulls is unleashed, and it goes on to purge the Necrons but also massacre at least part of the Bloodlords to satisfy its bloodlust.
Horsk	Horsk was an Imperial world located in the Imperium Nihilus. The planetary governor of Horsk sabotaged the void shielding, dooming the world and its population to asphyxiation. The governor did this rather than face whatever horrors that the Great Rift would visit on them.
Tahnel	Tahnel is an Ocean World located in the Segmentum Solar, close to the Forge World Phaeton. Tahnel lies in Segmentum Solar, very close to the forge world of Phaeton. It is a large world compared to Terra and is mostly covered with rolling oceans. Dotted across the surface are thousands and thousands of islands, some many hundreds of miles in diameter, some less than a mile. Rocky outcrops dominate these islands with flat fen land lying on the low ground. On most of the larger islands are vast sprawling cities, built above the swampland on enormous struts, housing millions of people each. These islands have many ports for the massive trawlers, which roam the teeming seas of Tahnel. With the mass of water on Tahnel it rains pretty much all the time, but it is generally a temperate climate. The planet's merchant sector relies on draining its vast oceans for food to process and transport throughout the sector, and in part this goes towards its Imperial tithe. But Tahnel is also known for meeting its tithe by supplying the Imperial war machine with men; millions of men, hundreds of regiments of the Tahnelian Airbourne, with one regiment founded every year.
Curwen	Curwen is an Agri-World of the Imperium. In M41, it was the site of a daemonic incursion led by the Great Unclean One Ku'Gath. Fortunately for the Imperium, the assault was defeated by the Grey Knights.
Ka'mais	Ka'mais was a Tau colony world ripe with conflict. In 876.M39, it was the site of a major Eldar attack, resulting in the Battle of Ka'mais. It was again invaded by Hive Fleet Gorgon in 902.M41. This triggered the emergence of a hidden Necron fleet from Ka'mais's dead moon which then set about destroying the outnumbered Tyranid ships. On Ka'mais a day of celebration was declared and as the Necrons landed they were greeted with great ceremony by Ethereal Aun'taniel. Despite the welcome, Aun'taniel was quickly slain by the Necrons and Ka'mais was then harvested.
Inquisitorial Fortress	Inquisitorial Fortresses are vast complexes utilized by the Inquisition as bases of operations in any given region of the Imperium. Scattered around the Imperium, some of these fortresses are known while others remain secret. Most fortresses hold prison cells, torture chambers, research laboratories, defensive bastions, armouries, and stores of supplies. Each fortress is guarded by Inquisitorial Storm Troopers. These Storm Troopers are supported by stocks of Rhinos, Chimeras, and Valkyrie gunships to provide Inquisitors with a core of well-trained, well-equipped troops. In addition, a fortress will maintain an armoury of vehicles, and these are issued to Storm Troopers or can be issued directly to the Inquisitor himself as a personal transport for him and his retinue.
Vespertine	Vespertine is a world of the galaxy.[1a] At some point in M41, Vespertine became a battleground between the Ultramarines (including elements of the Eighth Company, most notably Squad Sicarius) and the forces of the T'au Empire.[1a] The T'au on the planet were overwhelmed and defeated, partly due to the swiftness of the Imperial attack[1a] and partly because the majority of the T'au Battlesuits deployed in Vespertine's defence were equipped with weapons geared for fighting massed infantry - these arms were largely unable to penetrate the Space Marines' Power Armour.[1b]
Rustfane	Rustfane is an Imperial Desert Industrial World, that serves the Adeptus Mechanicus. In M42, the Thousand Sons attacked its desert-bound refineries and slaughtered the Adeptus Mechanicus' faithful within them. The Traitor Legion then vanished from the world and the purpose of their attack on Rustfane is not known.
Prester Myra	Prester Myra is an Imperium Cemetery World that is located in the Calixis Sector. The planet was once invaded by a Khorne Chaos Cult that nearly succeeded in conquering it, until the Chaos Champion that led them was killed by the Storm Trooper Occitus, who served in the retinue of Inquisitor Felroth Gelt. Without the Champion to lead them, the Cult was soon destroyed.
Jostero	Jostero is an Imperium world that nearly met its end when the Chaos worshiper known as the Prophet of Jostero formed an alliance with the Keeper of Secrets N'Kari and opened a gateway to the Warp that allowed the Daemon and its forces to invade the world. However, this also brought about the world's salvation, as when the gateway drew in a portion of the Realm of Chaos, the cursed Grey Knights Supreme Grand Master Kaldor Draigo was pulled onto Jostero as well. This allowed Draigo to fight alongside a Grey Knights Brotherhood that arrived to save the world and working together they defeated the Prophet of Jostero and banished N'Kari and its Daemon forces. Shortly after the gateway on Jostero was closed though, Draigo was drawn back into the Warp.
Dekhorra VI	Dekhorra VI is an Imperium world which, sometime after the Great Rift's creation, was invaded by Ork hordes.
Macharian Crusade	The Macharian Crusade (392-399.M41) was a seven-year Imperial military campaign (or Crusade) led by Lord Commander Solar Macharius.[17a] It took place on the far western edge of the galaxy, within the Segmentum Pacificus and leading into the Halo Zone. The campaign brought nearly one thousand worlds into the Imperium, and was one of the most successful crusades in its history. It all began on Donia which later became the Shrine World Macharia. Here, Macharius was born and began his rise in the ranks of the Imperial military. At his time, the Imperium was reeling from internal conflicts and civil war in Segmentum Solar, and he spent his early career mainly to overcoming various rebel and warlorde factions. Several of these he managed to convince to join him, and some former warlords would later become able commanders of his crusade. Eventually, Macharius rose to Lord Commander Solar; in this position, he petioned the High Lords of Terra for a new war of conquest in scale not seen since the Great Crusade. The High Lords agreed, and put the entire Astra Militarum at his disposal.[17a] Macharius set up seven great army groups for his grand campaign. He himself led the First Army Group.[17a] Eventually, he rallied his troops on Donia before boarding the waiting transports in orbit above the planet. Then they set off to conquer planets right out to the Galactic Rim, and even beyond the reach of the Astronomican. Many of the planets had been lost in the previous chaos of the Age of Apostasy.[2a]
None More Loyal (Short Story)	None More Loyal is a short story written by Mike Lee. It was released in December 2014 as part of the Black Library 2014 Advent Calendar. Crimson Fists Sergeant Sandor Galleas and his squad are assigned to aid an inquisitor who hunts a notorious renegade Space Marine. Setting out to entrap the traitor, the Crimson Fists soon find themselves surrounded and in danger - and their enemy may know them as well as they know themselves, as an ancient and deadly secret is revealed.
Triarch	The Triarch was the ruling council of the Necrontyr Infinite Empire before their transformation into the Necrons. Frequently undermined by rebellions in the Wars of Secession, the Triarch repeatedly attempted to find ways to unify the Necrontyr race once more, be it through a common enemy such as the Old Ones or the promises of immortality made by the C'tan.[1b] The Triarch itself consisted of three Phaerons and the rulers of individual Necrontyr dynasties were themselves governed by the Triarch. The head of the Triarch was known as the Silent King, for he addressed his subjects only through the other two Phaerons. Nominally a hereditary position, the short lifespans of the Necrontyr ensured that the title of Silent King passed from one royal dynasty to another many times.[1d] The last Silent King of the Triarch was Szarekh.[1a] During the war against the C'tan, the two other Triarchs were slain. During the Age of the Dark Imperium, Szarekh re-established the Triarch with Hapthatra the Radiant and Mesophet the Shadowed Hand. When the three go to battle, they do so atop the Dais of Dominion.
Mephet'ran	Lay down thy flesh, noble children of the Necrontyr. Lay down thy rot and disease. Unburden thy fear and worry. Cast off thy turbulent, inconstant hearts. Lay down thy flesh and death, the old enemy, will no longer be your master. ~ The Deceiver[6c] Mephet'ran, the Deceiver is a C'tan, a living god of the Necrons, that survives as fragmented shards. The Deceiver, as its name implies, enjoys using trickery, charisma, deception and lies to its own ends.[1e] The other C'tan quickly learned to distrust and shun the Deceiver.[1e] When the Necrontyr first encountered the Deceiver, it displayed fantastical abilities that made the frail civilization become awe-struck. The Necrontyr gave it the name Mephet'ran, The Messenger and hoped it would be able to bridge the gap between Necrontyr and C'tan.[1f] As the C'tan began to gather followers amongst the Necrontyr, the Deceiver eventually amassed the greatest following and influence. Despite the power the Deceiver wielded in Necrontyr society some - such as Orikan the Diviner - still held deep suspicions towards the Star God.
Living metal	Living metal is a metallic substance that appears to grow and heal as if it were part of a living organism. Comprised of many billions of Nanoscarabs, it is unique to the Necrons, being a main substance of their Necrodermis bodies.[1b] The Necrontyr originally invented living metal for use in constructing their ships. It is most often associated with the skin of the C'tan as well as the bodies of the Necrons and their amazing regenerative abilities.[1b] The hull of all Necron vehicles, including the Necron Monolith and the Necron Pylon, is also made of this living metal, where its adaptive and regenerative capabilities render powerful weapons such as Meltaguns, Multi-meltas and Power Fists almost obsolete.[1b]
Monolith	The Necron Monolith is a fearsome heavy support unit, and a key part of the immense arsenal of ancient technology used by the Necrons. A Monolith is a monumental vehicle, constructed from the same living metal as all other Necron vehicles. It fulfills the roles of transport craft, armoured destroyer and Necron power icon, sowing terror and destruction as it ponderously moves across the battlefield. The large crystal at its centre pulses with a sickly green light when it uses its Power Matrix to activate either its primary weapon system, the Particle Whip, or the dark portal in its frontal section to transport other Necron units. Necron Monoliths are heavily armoured and, thanks to its outer layer of living metal, are capable of self-repairing almost any damage sustained on the battlefield. The only true way to halt the advance of a Monolith is a sustained volley of heavy firepower to create a breach in its armoured shell to expose the vulnerable vital systems and crew. The first wave of a Necron assault often consists of Monoliths being teleported to a planet's surface to act as a bridgehead for invading forces, who deploy through the Monoliths' portals.
Necron Overlord	Necron Overlords are the highest and most powerful of the Necron race, ruling many Tomb Worlds. More powerful than even a Necron Lord, at its command are uncountable legions of Necron Warriors, terrifying war machines, and a vast array of devastating weaponry. Normally equipped with a Staff of Light, Necron Overlords are brilliant strategists, capable of calculating every possible outcome in the ensuing conflict and formulating strategies to ensure that everything goes to plan. Only the most unlikely situations can outfox him and only the most potent foes have any chance of beating him in combat. The most powerful Necron Overlords are those that rise to the rank of Phaeron, ruling over an entire Sector. Overlords are aided by powerful aid-de-camps known as Royal Wardens They are equipped with a variety of weaponry and equipment. For weaponry this includes a Warscythe, Voidscythe, Staff of Light, Hyperphase Sword, Voidblade, Tachyon Arrow, and Hyperphase Glaive. Support equipment can also include a Resurrection Orb[8b], Translocation Shroud, Sempiternal Weave, Mindshackle Scarabs, Tesseract Labyrinth, Phylactery, and Phase Shifter.[8b][3l]
Gothic	Gothic may refer to two human languages:
Doomsday Ark	Doomsday Arks are Necron grav-tanks used for heavy assaults. The design of the Doomsday Ark dates back to the days of the Necrontyr. It is similar in appearance to the Ghost Ark transport, though it sacrifices troop carrying capacity in favor of a single devastating Doomsday Cannon. It is not a tank in the conventional sense, but rather is essentially just a self-propelled doomsday cannon. Despite its fragile appearance these vehicles can make the weapons of the Imperium seem primitive. Even fired at low power the doomsday cannon is ferociously destructive, while at full power it eclipses conventional plasma weapons in power many times over and only a Titan could hope to withstand its firepower.
Mephrit Dynasty	The Mephrit Dynasty are a Dynasty of the Necrons.[1a] Renowned star-destroyers,[2a] their current territory is located in Ultima Segmentum.[2b] Their Phaeron was destroyed while in stasis, leaving the dynasty currently leaderless.[2a] During the War in Heaven, the Mephrit Dynasty specialised in stellar destruction, harnessing technology capable of turning stars supernova. The Silent King frequently turned to this dynasty to bring troublesome worlds to heel, even though most Necrontyr felt their methods ran counter to their codes of honourable warfare. To this day, the Mephrit mastery over stellar phenomena is evident in their weaponry, which are powered by the energy of captive suns.[2a] The Mephrit are also said to have been old enemies of the Sautekh Dynasty. The Phaeron of the dynasty, Khyrek the Eternal, was lost during the Great Sleep; destroyed during his slumber by Eldar assassins, leaving the awakened dynasty leaderless. This has led to the lesser nobility vying amongst themselves for power, each hoping to wrest control of the dynasty. The most powerful contenders currently are Overlords Zarathusa the Ineffable, Eknothet the Glorious, and Anubitar of the Thousand Victories. Several ambitious nobles are now seeking the Technomandrites' aid in reclaiming the Mephrit Dynasty's ability to murder stars. The first to do so, will surely become the next ruler of its forces.[4a] Also since their awakening, a breakaway faction of the Mephrit Dynasty has formed as well. They are known as the Mephrit-Ghiar Dynasty, but though their bodies are pale white, the Dynasty's weaponry still displays the orange glow of their parent Mephrit.
Cortical linkage	Cortical linkage, also know as the linkage of minds, is a method of mental enhancement by combining the knowledge and experiences of one individual with another, resulting in blended personalities. This method is often by the Mechanicus while other sections of humanity employ other methods, as do certain xenos.[1c] For example, the Necron and their knowledge of consciousness transfer. Other methods of direct knowledge transfer include engrammatic reproduction, psychic rip, genophagy, noospheric upload and many more, but all are flawed. Cortical linkage is the direct grafting of one consciousness, via machinic connection through the infospheric medium, from one mind to another. It has its own host of flaws, as well.[1b] Other methods of knowledge transfer from one brain to another includes engrammitic exloads or neuronal scans.
Nanobot	Nanobots, also known as micro-machines, are various forms of microscopic automata used by the Imperium as well as various other Xenos races. Some of those used by humanity and the forces of Chaos date back to the Dark Age of Technology.[2a]
Ouroboros (artifact)	The Ouroboros, also known as The Consumer[2a] is an Old Ones[3a] artifact that was found on Caliban during the Horus Heresy. A sentient Warp device and a sister to the Tuchulcha and Plagueheart, the Ouroboros helped to corrupt the Dark Angels Librarian Zahariel into becoming one of the Fallen. Zahariel claimed that the Ouroboros was a manifestation of Caliban itself.[1a] The Ouroboros was hated by the Watchers in the Dark of Caliban.[1b] Much later in the 41st Millennium, Cypher revealed that the Ourobors was acquired by Typhus and Astelan in attempt to unite it with its sister devices and change history. Eventually all 3 devices were gathered and a warp rift was summoned over the ruins of Caliban. Convinced by Ezekiel to leave history be and trying to prevent nearby Fallen forces from accessing the rift first, Azrael destroyed the rift.[2x] Ouroboros remained among the ruins of Caliban until the intervention of Vashtorr the Arkifane, who sought the Ouroboros along with its sister devices in order to create The Key and thereby ultimately access an Old Ones device dubbed The Weapon. In the Arks of Omen Campaign, he succeeded in gathering the Ouroboros (whose fragment was now converted into Wyrmwood) and Plagueheart but still needed the Tuchulcha. In the Battle of Idolatros, Vashtorr succeeded in contacting the Tuchulcha and moving it to Wyrmwood. Together with its sister devices, the Ouroboros created the Dissonance Engine which bore a tunnel into the space between the Materium and Warp not unlike the Webway. With this new rift, Vashtorr seeks The Lock and with it The Weapon.[3b]
Null field	Null-fields are an effect that disrupts, negates, or completely blocks Warp and psychic effects, typically within a set area. The size, strength, and overall effect of a null-field can vary drastically. Null-fields are similar to force fields, in a way, but pertain to blocking or disrupting warp energy specifically. Null-fields are utilised by Humanity and other xenos species via capabilities or technology. Necrons are adept at creating warp nullification technologies. Noctilith Pylons are an extremely potent example.
Omnishield Helm	The Omnishield Helm is a piece of equipment used by Imperial Tempestus Scions. These helms are equipped with respirators that allow the wearer to be protected from poisons to the cold vacuum of space. The multi-spectral occulum that attaches via suction to the wearer's eyes allow him to see in low-light and occluded conditions with ease.
Plagueheart	The Plagueheart is an Old Ones[2a] artifact. Belonging to the same trinity as the Tuchulcha and Ouroboros, the Plagueheart is a vast living planetoid. In the 41st Millennium, Cypher revealed that Typhus and Astelan were attempting to unite the 3 devices and change history.[1a] Eventually all 3 devices were gathered and a warp rift was summoned over the ruins of Caliban. Convinced by Ezekiel to leave history be and trying to prevent nearby Fallen forces from accessing the rift first, Azrael destroyed the rift.[1b] Vashtorr the Arkifane sought the Plagueheart along with its sister devices in order to create The Key in order to ultimately access an Old Ones device dubbed The Weapon. In the Arks of Omen Campaign, Vashtorr succeeded in gathering Plagueheart and Ouroboros but still needed the Tuchulcha. In the Battle of Idolatros, Vashtorr succeeded in contacting the Tuchulcha and moving it to Wyrmwood. Together with its sister devices, the Plagueheart created the Dissonance Engine which bore a tunnel into the space between the Materium and Warp not unlike the Webway. With this new rift, Vashtorr seeks The Lock and with it The Weapon.[2b]
Faster-than-Light	Faster-Than-Light or (FTL) travel is the primary method of long-distance transportation in the Galaxy. The technology allows for passengers to travel faster than the speed of light in order to traverse the immense distances of interstellar space in a reasonable amount of time.
Power Field	Power Fields, also known as disruption fields, are a type of energy field generated by Power Weapons. When a power weapon is activated, the power field will sheathe across the weapon's surface in what is described as a crackling blue haze of discharged energy. Power Fields allow these weapons to disrupt any solid matter it touches, including even Power Armour.
Mimesis Engine	The Mimesis Engine is a technological artefact that dates from the time before the Emperor first ascended the throne. This bizarre machine had the capacity to create entirely simulated worlds and environments. Its capabilities allowed it to create simulations of thousands of unreal worlds and even amalgamating them based on records of those environments. Furthermore, it is capable of populating these environments with a number of simulacra of Xenos species. This functioned by generating the apparent form and behaviour for a vast array of life forms. The simulations did hold traits that marked their true nature as the Engine failed to record the particularities of personality amongst its simulacra. Those users of the machine were required to climb into rod and wire-strung smooth carapace battlesuits in order to interact the worlds produced by the Engine where they manifested within simulated bodies such as Terminator Dreadnought Armour. Ultimately, the machine is connected to the material universe and thus all its replica environments are connected to it instead of the Warp. This piece of ancient technology was first unearthed by the Imperium of Man who began using it to create training grounds for the initiates of the Adeptus Astartes. These simulated worlds were ones where the aspiring initiates could fight and die along with learning from their mistakes without dying as a result of failed strategies. Decades were spent by groups of lexmechanics, artisans and logises where they were constructing the Mimesis Engine. However, concerns were raised about the sanctity and purity of the technology being used for this endeavour due to the capacity to remake the universe was similar to the approach taken by the forces of Chaos Gods. Following the completion of the project, its supporters proposed the Engine being assigned to the Iron Hearts Chapter for testing where it was employed in the training of their initiates. Despite this being the case, excercises were preceded by ritual invocations of the Emperor's protection from Chaos taint and ended with the Service of Absolution in the Chapter's Chapel of Martyrs. Amongst the many worlds created by the Engine included Argos, Belladonna, Celadon, Evangelion, Fortelius, Galatea, Hyperious and Ilium that were all completely secure and isolated from every other system in the Iron Hearts outpost. Amongst those placed as the designated supervisor of the Mimesis Engine was instructor Sergeant Tydaeus of the Iron Hearts. In time, interest within the technology began to dwindle as fewer interests battle the simulations created by the Engine which saw the maintenance team reduced until only Tydaeus and a Servitor named Barek remained.
The Lock	The Lock is an Old Ones vault dating back to the War in Heaven. The Lock holds a powerful device dubbed The Weapon, and can only be accessed with The Key.[1a] During the Arks of Omen Campaign, the Daemon Vashtorr succeeded in creating The Key and now seeks The Lock in order to acquire The Weapon.[1b]
Tuchulcha	The Tuchulcha Engine is an ancient sentient device and possible Warp entity. Of Old Ones origin,[5a] Tuchulcha is part of a triumvirate of similar entities (Ouroboros and Plagueheart) which when combined can create a rift that bridges space and time. On its own, Tuchulcha is capable of extremely efficient, precise and accurate Warp jumps.[1a] During the Horus Heresy, Tuchulcha was discovered by Lion El'Jonson in the Perditus System. The Lion prevented Calas Typhon of the Death Guard from acquiring the engine for his own twisted ends and was determined to use it to defeat the Night Lords and their Primarch, Konrad Curze.[1b] El'Jonson began to converse frequently with the Tuchulcha in the aftermath of the battle, confiding with it above all others. During the attempts to breach the Ruinstorm and reach Terra, Tuchulcha demonstrated the limits of its abilities. It told the Lion honestly that it could not navigate the storm to Terra on its own, frustrating the Lion. At some point towards the end of the Heresy, Tuchulcha became embedded within The Rock.[Needs Citation]
The Weapon	The Weapon is an Old Ones device which dates back to the War in Heaven.[1a] Its power is said to be able to destroy the Imperium and elevate a Daemon such as Vashtorr to a fifth Chaos God The Weapon is held in an dimensional subpocket dubbed The Lock, which can only be accessed by assembling The Key. However, during the Arks of Omen Campaign, Vashtorr, and his ally Abaddon the Despoiler succeeded in creating The Key and now seek The Lock.[1b]
Slate Monitron	The Slate Monitron is a piece of equipment used by the Militarum Tempestus and other elite Imperial operatives. This dataslate, worn upon the gauntlet of a typical Tempestus Scion, allows him instant access to his latest commands and war psalms. It also monitors vital signs, pulse rate, and health matrix of the wearer of all times. Other Monitrons can dispense small tools such as canisters of skin sealant, function as cogitators, vox-casters and auspex with motion, heat and echolocation capabilities.[2a][2b][2c][2d] It is an old Imperial Guard jibe that Tempestus Scions are dead inside, for upon completion of their training their hearts are locked in an iron box on their sleeve.
Warp jump	A warp jump is a form of faster-than-light travel around the Galaxy by means of entering the Warp, a parallel psychic dimension, and re-emerging to a new location in real space light years away from the starting position. A warp jump consists of a ship entering the warp from real space by activating its warp drives to open a tear between realities, traveling the currents of the warp by means of its conventional drives for an appropriate time, and then using its warp drives to re-enter real space at a new position, having bypassed light years of galactic space. This process is known as a jump or hop, and the act of entering or leaving the warp is known as a drop, shift, or translation.[1b] In order to safely utilize the Warp for travel, one must first travel to a System's Mandeville Point. This is the closest distance that a ship can safely enter or exit Warp Space from its intended destination. If one does not travel to a Mandeville Point, they risk having their Warp jump's direction and navigational calculations interfered with by the gravity of planets and other celestial objects. When a portal for a Warp jump is opened, whether a vessel is exiting or entering the warp, it destabilizes nearby gravity. The closer one is to the portal, the greater the gravitational instability, until the portal closes. The dangers of executing a warp jump while within a gravity-well are known to every voidcraft captain of the Imperium. If done so, the warp rift of the vessel won't immediately clench shut after passing through and will instead grow to engulf anything nearby in warp and gravitational anomaly. This invariably unleashes untold ruination upon the local area post-departure.[14b]
Dissonance Engine	The Dissonance Engine is a device similar to the same technology the Old Ones used to create the Webway.[1a] The Dissonance Engine was created by Vashtorr the Arkifane and is intended to tunnel a hole into the reality between the Materium and Warp when combined with The Key. During the Battle of Idolatros, Vashtorr succeeded in activating the device and used the Dissonance Engine to create a new rift in reality which he now uses to seek The Lock and then The Weapon.[1b]
Pharos (Device)	The Pharos is a pre-Imperial piece of Necron[5c] technology that is able to harness empathy to allow the user to find, communicate, or even teleport to a location they either consciously or subconsciously desired, without the use of the Warp. Instead of routing through the Warp, it connected two points directly within the Materium via quantum entanglement.[5c] It could also secondarily aid in Warp travel, being used to navigate the Warp much like the Astronomican, except while the Astronomican utilized psychic power to provide a reference point and acted as a "lighthouse" in the Warp, the Pharos utilized empathic energies and would illuminate the needed location, making it appear as a comparative "lantern", which would provide a path to where a ship needed to go. Due to using empathic power, instead of psychic, the Pharos' function was completely unhindered by Warp Storms. Built from Blackstone[5b], the Pharos array was originally constructed by the Necrons for rapid communications and FTL travel. The Pharos is powered by eight C'tan Shards, one of which is Zarhulash.[5d] When the Necrons emerged into their great slumber, the array went inactive. By the Age of the Imperium the only known surviving Pharos was on Sotha. Belisarius Cawl states that he found another Pharos elsewhere, but it was long destroyed. Like most other Necron Blackstone technology, the Pharos is able to negate the effects and presence of the Warp.[5c]
