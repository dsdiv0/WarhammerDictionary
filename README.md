**Warhammer 40k Dictionary for KOReader**

This project provides a comprehensive, offline Warhammer 40k dictionary for the KOReader e-reader application. It's designed for fans reading Warhammer novels who want to quickly look up terms, characters, and lore without leaving the book or needing an internet connection.

The dictionary entries are generated by a C# script that scrapes and cleans content from the Warhammer 40k Lexicanum wiki.

**How to Use**

**1. Prerequisites**

Make sure you have the necessary tools installed.

    Python: Download and install from the official Python website. Make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

    .NET 9 SDK: Download and install from the official .NET website.

    pyglossary: Install via pip from your terminal.

    pip install pyglossary

2. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/dsdiv0/WarhammerDictionary.git
cd WarhammerDictionary
```
4. Generate the Data File

Run the scraper from the project's root directory. This may take a while.
```
dotnet run
```
This creates a warhammer.tsv file.
4. Convert to Dictionary Format

Use pyglossary to convert the TSV into the Stardict format.
```
pyglossary warhammer.tsv warhammer_dict --write-format=Stardict
```
5. Install on KOReader

Copy the entire warhammer_dict folder to the KOReader/data/dict/ directory on your e-reader.
